Discussion \nBlood and blood-contaminated items are frequently encountered \nduring a crime scene investigation, and extracting DNA from such \nsamples in the later stages of the investigation is critical to procure ev­\nidence regarding the incident and the criminal. However, criminals \noften try to clean up the blood at the crime scene in order to destroy \nevidence, and in some cases, they attempt to destroy evidence by \nwashing bloodstained clothing. Previous studies based on the determi­\nnation of location of the bloodstain after the washing process are usually \nconducted using chemical substances, such as luminol. Although the FLS \nsystems have been shown to be effective in detecting biological \nstains,11,12 the number of studies that employed the FLS system is \nlimited. Furthermore, the effect of blood persistence and stain lag time \nof washed clothes on the detection rate of evidence has not been fully \nexplored. Therefore, we used a cutting-edge Forenscope light source \nsystem (Forenscope), which is more efficient than the traditional \nforensic light source systems. \nIn the present study, the best FLS system image was obtained in \nvelvet, cotton, polar fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics. Gupta et al. \nobtained pronounced result in hand-washed cotton fabric using the \nluminol test.2 In the study conducted by Edler et al. using luminol, after \nwashing some fabric by hand and some by machine, the least blood \nresidue was observed in micro fleece fabrics (24.2%), whereas macro­\nscopic bloodstains were detected in all the cotton denim samples.17 \nAmong all samples, the presence of blood was detected macroscopically \nin 57.2% samples after the washing process, whereas a reaction rate of \n95.9% was observed in all samples by the luminol technique; this rate \nwas 88.6% in the control samples.17 In the present study, the stain \nlocation was detected after washing in 72% evaluated images. The \nimage quality obtained after washing may have been influenced by the \nFig. 4.

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

When the stain\nsize is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the\ncorrelation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-\nsional number against a nondimensional number.\nThe circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-\nmeterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the\nstain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain\ndiameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as\nb (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape\n(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both\nthe stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4.

    "text_chunk": "APPLIED PHYSICAL\nSCIENCES\nECOLOGY\nCloser inspection of these temperature ﬂuctuations reveals\nthat they are periodic (Fig. 5E, Insets). Indeed, the period of\n2 s for the large drops and 0.3 s for the small drops corre-\nsponds precisely with the time interval between the dripping of\nthe large and small drops, respectively, providing additional evi-\ndence that the cooling corresponds to the droplet bounce events.\nAlthough the cooling from these drops might seem insigniﬁcant,\nit should be noted that the ambient temperature and water drops\nare relatively warm (T ≈26 ◦C). More signiﬁcant temperature\ndrops would be expected in colder conditions. Indeed, identical\nexperiments conducted outdoors in colder weather (T ≈3.9 ◦C)\nresulted in signiﬁcantly greater cooling when the drops bounced\non the heated, superhydrophobic feather (Fig. S5).\nConclusion\nThe ﬁndings presented in this study add insight into the ﬁnite-\ntime heat transfer that occurs when a hot or cold drop bounces\non a superhydrophobic substrate. We demonstrate experimen-\ntally and theoretically that a small fraction of available heat is\nexchanged when a water drop impacts and bounces off a super-\nhydrophobic substrate and that the heat can be modeled as being\ndirectly exchanged with the solid substrate. A consequence of\nthis direct exchange is that a greater fraction of available heat is\nexchanged for smaller than for larger drops, even though larger\ndrops are in contact with the surface for a longer period. Equally\nsigniﬁcant is the role of the substrate material in the amount\nof heat exchanged. We highlight how such principles extend to\na more general case of multiple bouncing drops and identify\ndimensionless parameters that can guide the design of nonwet-\nting materials for which heat exchange with impacting drops may\nbe a factor, such as weather-related fabrics. In the context of\navian hypothermia associated with cold rain, past work has indi-\ncated that feather water repellency mitigates evaporative cooling\n(40); our results highlight another important mechanism associ-\nated with this process: direct heat exchange with the rain itself.\nMaterials and Methods\nExperimental\nMethodology. High-speed\nimages\nare\ncaptured\nusing\na\nPhotron camera with a frame rate of 10,000 frames per second and a\n200-mm Nikon lens. A ﬁber-optic light source provides cool, high-intensity\nlight to the samples during high-speed imaging. Thermographic images are\nsimultaneously recorded with a thermal camera at a frame rate of 200\nframes per second with a close-up IR lens. To control the water tempera-\nture, a water bath is connected to a syringe that can eject a single drop on\ndemand. The drop velocity is controlled by varying the height of the needle\nabove the substrate. Velocity adjustments are made to limit the range of\nthe spreading factor rm/R. In the cooling from the multiple-drops experi-\nments, the feather is suspended by using a stand and clamp. The top of the\nfeather is subjected to two sets of water drops released from two different\nsizes of needles. A constant ﬂow rate for both sets of drops is maintained\nwith a dual syringe pump. Finally, a heat gun is used to heat the feather\nfrom below.\nSubstrate Material Characterization. To measure the heat capacity of the\nsubstrate material, thermal analysis is conducted with a Q2000 differential\nscanning calorimeter (DSC). The DSC sample measurements are referenced\nagainst pure indium metal and evaluated over a range of 15−45 ◦C, follow-\ning standard procedures (41). The heat capacity and density of glass, rubber,\nand wood are measured experimentally and the thermal conductivity values\nare obtained from the literature (42–44).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank J.

Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Experimental protocol\nFor each trial, \u00041 ml of blood was taken from the pig blood\ncontainer in the water bath container using a 10 ml syringe and\ndeposited on the ﬂat plywood impact surface within the strike\nzone (i.e. the area directly impacted by the F17 timber arm outlined\nby marker in Fig. 6). Within seconds of placement, to minimize\nheat loss from the blood, a controlled impact was applied to the\nblood pool by releasing the F17 timber from its starting position at\neach increment. Each impact on the device was video recorded by\nusing a GoPro camera on a tripod with a timer on an Apple iPad Air\ndisplayed.\nAfter each impact the furthest lying visible single bloodstain\nwas located and measured horizontally to the point of origin (distal\nend of the F17 timber) using a Hilti PD42 laser measurer. To ensure\naccurate measurement, a vertical pole from the bloodstain was\nused to guide the position of the laser measurer. A high resolution\nimage using a Nikon D300 dSLR camera was also taken from\ndirectly above the blood stains (Fig. 7). The F17 timber arm and\nstrike plate were cleaned of blood residue after each test.\nFive replicates were performed at increments A and B at Height\n1 (250 mm from ﬂoor), and ten replicates for increments C–G. Due\nto results obtained at this initial height, increments F and G were\nnot tested at greater heights. Therefore, ﬁve replicates were\nperformed for A and B and ten replicates for increments C–E for\nboth Heights 2 (1160 mm from the ﬂoor) and 3 (1780 mm from the\nﬂoor), resulting in a total of 140 impacts across the three heights.\nVisual analysis of the ceiling of the room was also conducted to\ndetermine if any stains had reached that height. The distance data\nobtained was analysed in real-time during the experiment for\nconsistency and variation, with one sample t-tests being used to\ntest datasets within each increment to determine if additional\nreplicates were required to generate reliable results. Each group of\nreplicates was also checked during experimentation for normality,\nskewness and kurtosis, with z-tests being used to determine the\nequality of variances between adjacent groups (increments and\nheights) during testing.\nStatistical analysis was performed in SPSS v21.0 (IBM Corpora-\ntion, Chicago). The consistency of impact time and therefore\nkinetic energy across the repeated experiments was investigated\nusing a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparing\nbefore and after time measurements. A two-way ANOVA was\nconducted to compare the main effects and interaction of the\nordinal variables height and increment on the furthest distance\nblood travelled.\n3. Results\n3.1. Kinetic energy released during impact\nThecharacteristicsof thetimberarm, spring and increments were\nmeasured to calculate the ﬁnal velocity of the arm and the kinetic\nenergy imparted to the blood stain upon impact (Table 1). The\nconsistency of impact kinetic energy was investigated by measuring\nthe time taken for the F17 timber arm to travel from release to impact\nprior to the experiments across 5–10 replicates per increment, and\nthe corresponding time post-experiment with 10 replicates per\nincrement (Table 2). A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that no\nsigniﬁcant differences existed between the pre- and post-experi-\nment times overall (F2,53 = 0.066, p = 0.798), and that there was no\ndifferential changes in travel times between increments (F6,53 = 1.35,\np = 0.252). It can therefore be inferred that the time taken for the F17\ntimber arm to travel, and therefore the kinetic energy imparted, was\nconsistent throughout the experiment.\n3.2. Experimental test results\nThe impact height and kinetic energy imparted both inﬂuenced\nthe distance the blood travelled after impact. Impact heights of\n250 mm resulted in distances ranging from 2109 mm to 3404 mm\n(Table 3), with an overall average of 2835 mm across all seven\nincrements and 2109 mm from the lower ﬁve. Impact heights of\n1160 mm resulted in distances travelled of 2895 mm–4850 mm,\nwith an average of 3732 mm from the lower ﬁve increments.\nImpact heights of 1780 mm resulted in blood droplets travelling\nbetween 3256 mm and 5361 mm, with an average of 3901 mm.\nBoth the height and increment had signiﬁcant effects on the\ndistance that the blood travelled (height F2\n123 = 281.92, p < 0.01;\nincrement F6\n123 = 58.17, p < 0.01), with height showing a greater\neffect (h2 = 0.43) than the increment (h2 = 0.27). There was also a\nsmall but signiﬁcant interaction between the height and increment\n(F8\n123 = 6.24, p < 0.01), although this interaction had a minimal\neffect size (h2 = 0.04).\nFig. 6. \u00041 ml liquid blood (within the strike zone marked with blue marker pen) on\nthe marine ply strike surface.\nFig. 7.

Introduction\nFor crime scene investigation in cases of homicide or criminal\nassault, the pattern of bloodstains at the incident site is of critical\nimportance. The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to\ndetermine the approximate blood source locations in forensic\ncrime reconstructions.\nFor this approach, up to now, various methods of bloodstain\npattern analysis have been used [1–5]. The stringing method, the\ntangent method and the virtual stringing method are by the use of\ncomputer software [6,7]. In the stringing method, the trajectories\nof the blood drops are simpliﬁed as straight lines. The impact\ndirections of the bloodstains are reconstructed by afﬁxing strings\nat the position of the bloodstains and pulling them away from the\nsurface, on which the bloodstain has spilt, in the approximate\nimpact direction. This direction is determined by the directionality\nand relation of the length and width of the elliptical shaped\nbloodstain. The approximate location of the blood source is\nestimated to be where the majority of strings intersect. In the\ntangent method, the ﬂight path of the blood drop is assumed to be a\nhypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. This method is valid only for\nfast-moving blood drops with a ﬂat trajectory before impacting on\nthe surface. Due to unknown curvatures of the individual ﬂight\npath, unknown systematic errors in the horizontal value of the\nlocation of the blood source may occur [2]. The virtual stringing\nmethod\nis\nequivalent\nto\nthe\ntraditional\nstringing\nmethod\ntransposed onto the computer.\nIn the present work, a ballistic analysis to approximate the\ntrajectories of the blood drops, for the determination of the centres\nof origin of the bloodstains, is evaluated.\n2.

The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to determine the approximate\nblood source locations, the minimum number of blows and the positioning of the victim.\nIn the present work, the beneﬁts of the three-dimensional bloodstain pattern analysis, including the\nballistic approximation of the trajectories of the blood drops, will be demonstrated using two illustrative\ncases.\nThe crime scenes were documented in 3D, using the non-contact methods digital photogrammetry,\ntachymetry and laser scanning. Accurate, true-to-scale 3D models of the crime scenes, including the\nbloodstain pattern and the traces, werecreated.For the determination ofthe areas oforigin ofthe bloodstain\npattern, the trajectories of up to 200 well-deﬁned bloodstains were analysed in CAD and photogrammetry\nsoftware. The ballistic determination of the trajectories was performed using ballistics software.\nThe advantages of this method are the short preparation time on site, the non-contact measurement\nof the bloodstains and the high accuracy of the bloodstain analysis. It should be expected that this\nmethod delivers accurate results regarding the number and position of the areas of origin of bloodstains,\nin particular the vertical component is determined more precisely than using conventional methods.

For violent crimes\ninvolving gunshots, standard practice in police departments worldwide have some physical limitations.\nFor instance, the effect of gravity and air drag on trajectories of blood droplets are neglected using current\nreconstruction methods, which results in a well-known overestimation of the height of the source of\nblood. As a consequence, more sophisticated models for blood spatter trajectory reconstruction are being\ndeveloped, two of which are highlighted in the present work. They allow the prediction of bloodstain\npatterns produced from backward spattered blood droplets from blunt and sharp bullets. Our recent\nmodels attribute the splashing of blood to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability which arises when blood is\naccelerated towards lighter air. This physically-based description comes with the powerful predictive\ncapability to correlate features of bloodstain patterns with the speciﬁc bullet and gun that produced\nthem, as well as with the body position. The results of the numerical models were compared with four\nexperiments simulating blood spatter deposition on a vertical wall through the number of stains\nproduced, average stain area, and average impact angle at the surface, and the agreement found is fairly\ngood. Moreover, further insight is obtained by probing and explaining the inﬂuence of observable\nparameters on the resulting spatter pattern, with the goal of aiding BPA experts evaluating a crime scene.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the inspection of blood\nspatter patterns which were produced due to violent crimes [1].\nThe goal of BPA is to provide answers to questions arising from the\nscene of a violent crime such as what caused these patterns.\nDetermination of the region of origin of the blood spatter is\nexpected from the BPA community [2], however, current techni-\nques lack a fundamental basis in ﬂuid mechanics [3]. Namely, the\nmethod of strings, or the trigonometric method, which has been in\nuse since as early as the 1950s [4] and is implemented in widely\ndistributed software [5–9], neglects physical realities such as\ngravity and air drag [2]. Understandably, this results in signiﬁcant\nwell-established errors [10,11], for example, there can be a 50%\noverestimation of the height of the region of origin [12]. Moreover,\nthe widely used formula for the determination of the impact angle\nof a blood droplet, sin α = W/L [13], where W is the width of the\nstain and L is the length, has major ﬂaws since the values of sine of\nthe impact angle are practically indistinguishable between 75\u0001 and\n90\u0001. Namely, they vary from 0.97 for 75\u0001 and 1 for 90\u0001, and is the\nreason that standard BPA practice encourages stains with impact\nangles less than 60\u0001 be used for reconstruction [1].\nAdding to the difﬁculty of an accurate reconstruction model of\nblood spatter patterns is the rheological complexity of blood. Blood\nis a non-Newtonian, shear thinning [14–16] complex aqueous\nsolution containing various cells and proteins in plasma, and\nbegins to coagulate as soon as it is outside of the human body\n[17,18]. Moreover, \nits rheological behavior depends on \nthe\nhematocrit [14,19], it exhibits viscoelasticity [16,19–21] and\npossesses a yield stress [22]. This rheological behavior is important\nin crime scene reconstruction because it can affect the atomization\nprocess [23–26], which is diminished in liquids which exhibit\nviscoelastic properties [26–28]. Resultant droplet sizes are also\ninﬂuenced by these effects [29–34] as well as their ﬁnal impact on\nsurfaces [31,35,36]. Additionally, blood droplets are spattered at\nbody temperature and often are subject in ﬂight to air at a different\ntemperature, the effects of which have been investigated [37], but\nnever in the context of BPA.\nWith some of these challenges in mind, several models have\nbeen developed to attempt to better recreate crime scenes.\nIncluding the effect of drag via a probabilistic approach was\nproposed in Refs. [38,39]. Further still, in Ref. [40], both gravity and\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: ayarin@uic.edu (A.L.

Horse blood was\ndropped vertically onto three calico fabrics with different mass per unit areas (85.1 g/m2, 163.5 g/m2 and\n224.6 g/m2). Six different impact velocities were used (1.7 ms\u00011, 2.9 ms\u00011, 4.1 ms\u00011, 4.9 ms\u00011, 5.1 ms\u00011 and\n5.4 ms\u00011). The dry bloodstains were largest on the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. The low\nyarn linear density and large inter-yarn spaces meant that the blood could wick into the yarns from all\ndirections and along the intra-yarn spaces. The calico with the middle mass per unit area had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area for four out of the six velocities. The twist level for this calico was greater than\nfor the calicos with a heavier or lighter mass per unit area. This reduced the amount of wicking which\noccurred along the yarns due to the tighter yarn structure. The calico with the heaviest mass per unit area\nhad the highest yarn linear density resulting in a thicker fabric, so the blood could not as easily penetrate\ninto the fabric. This resulted in a thicker wet blood layer remaining on the fabric surface, where it\ngradually wicked vertically into the yarns under gravity. Less wicking along the yarns occurred, resulting\nin a smaller bloodstain than on the fabric with the lightest mass per unit area. The correlation between\nimpact velocity and mean dry bloodstain area was greater for the calicos with the medium and heaviest\nmass per unit area than for the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. For the calicos with the\nmedium and heaviest mass per unit area, the distance the blood spread laterally at impact, which\nincreased with the increase in impact velocity, had a greater inﬂuence on the dry bloodstain area than the\namount of wicking.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nAlthough bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has been used by\ncrime scene investigators for over a century [1], questions have\nbeen raised on the scientiﬁc validity of the work [2]. The premise\nof BPA is that the pattern that blood creates when impacting a\nsurface will enable the observer to gain an idea of the events\nwhich occurred to cause the bloodshed. However, the wide\nvariety of creation mechanisms, drop sizes, impact velocities and\ntarget surfaces indicate the complexity of BPA [3]. The reliability\nof pattern classiﬁcation of ﬁve bloodstain patterns on non-\nabsorbent rigid surfaces [4] and fabric surfaces [5] by expert BPA\nanalysts \nhas \nbeen \nconsidered. \nOn \nnon-absorbent \nsurfaces\nincorrect classiﬁcations were made 13.1% of the time [4] and\non fabric surfaces incorrect classiﬁcations were made 23.4% of the\ntime [5].\nAs such, more research is being undertaken on the understand-\ning of the interaction of blood with a variety of surfaces. Work has\nbeen carried out on non-absorbent surfaces (e.g. steel and plastic\n[6]) and partially absorbent surfaces (e.g. paper and wood [7–9]).\nEquations have resulted that use the bloodstain size and number of\nspines \nto back-calculate the impact velocity and \nassist \nin\ndetermination of the origin of the bloodstain [7–9].\nBloodstains on household and clothing fabrics often found at\ncrime scenes are also being researched. To understand bloodstains\non fabrics, it is important to consider wetting and wicking. Wetting\nand wicking are the mechanisms by which liquids move into and\nthrough a fabric [10]. Wetting occurs when the surface energy of a\nsolid overcomes the surface tension of a liquid, allowing the liquid\nto spread on the surface [10]. Once a fabric has been wetted,\nwicking can occur. Wicking is the spontaneous transport of a liquid\ninto a porous system by capillary forces. The rate at which the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: c.knock@cranﬁeld.ac.uk (C.

Introduction\nScenes of violent crime are frequently associated with blood\nspatter. The patterns of spatter are often attributed to impact\nspatter, movements of the victim or assailant or cast off from a\nweapon. However, some blood may have originated from the\nrespiratory system and been distributed by mechanisms that\nfollow different physical processes and the observed distributions\nmay require to be interpreted in a different way. Furthermore, it is\npossible for such aerosols to be produced some time after death\nwhen liquid blood is still present. Founding fathers of pathology,\nsuch as Morgagni, Hunter and Virchow knew that, after violent\ndeath, often blood did not clot and acted as if it contained a\nﬁbrinolysin, although these facts are sometimes overlooked in\nmodern times. This paper analyses these phenomena and discusses\ntheir implications.\nTheobjective was to develop a scientiﬁcally based understanding\nof the probable behaviour of airborne respired blood aerosols and\nwhether, ornot, theobservedamountanddistributionofbloodspots\non clothing of a murder suspect could possibly be the result of\nrespired blood as opposed to impact spattered blood [1–6]. We have\nbeen unable to ﬁnd any clear explanations in the forensic science\nliterature or textbooks which provided a reliable scientiﬁcally based\ndescription of the processes involved in creating respired blood\naerosols from the nose or mouth, or indeed puncture wounds to the\nchest, of the physical mechanisms underlying their ﬂight char-\nacteristics, or how spots of respired blood captured on clothing\nmight be distinguished from, or confused with, spots originating\nfrom other sources, particularly impact spatter.\nA number of simple human and physical model experiments\nwere undertaken that could be considered to be a reasonable\nrepresentation of real situations. Studies were performed that\ncould relate to the expulsion of blood from the nose or mouth by\nthe conscious action of a subject, or be\ncaused to occur\ninvoluntarily by a subject, alive or dead. It is appreciated that\nthe studies reported here may be of relevance, not only to respired\naerosols via the nose or mouth, but, to the production and fate of\nblood aerosols derived from expiration of air via puncture wounds\nto the upper airway, trachea or chest [7,8].\nIn this paper, we consider ﬁrst the experimental studies we\nundertook and then relate these to the known physical processes\nrelating to airﬂow generated aerosols. Whilst the experimental\nstudies demonstrate that exhaled aerosols can potentially travel\ndistances in excess of 1 m, the general question of their motion\nover greater distances was not explored; this was because the\nﬂight characteristics are strongly dependent on the exhalation\nairﬂow properties and these are can vary greatly. A deﬁnitive study\nof the motion to greater distances would involve a considerable\nresearch project in its own right, beyond the scope of the principal\nfocus of the present work.\nForensic Science International 204 (2011) 144–155\nA R T I C L E\nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 3 August 2009\nReceived in revised form 13 January 2010\nAccepted 24 May 2010\nAvailable online 18 June 2010\nKeywords:\nRespired blood spatter\nRespirated blood droplet size\nBlood pattern analysis\nExhaled blood aerosol transport\nChest stab wounds\nA B S T R A C T\nThe nature of blood aerosols produced in physiological studies of an upright subject expiring small\nvolumes through straws, spitting and mouthing sounds, and a semi-prone subject spitting through a\nbloody mouth or snorting through a single nasal oriﬁce and by a simpliﬁed physical model of the\nrespiratory system were investigated. Each manoeuvre produced many hundreds of droplets of a range\nof size, the vast majority being less than 1 mm diameter. Droplets under 1 mm dia. travelled over 1 m –\nmuch further than could be expected if their ﬂight was ballistic, like that of impact spatter. Respired\nblood aerosol properties are explained in terms of established mechanics of airﬂow shear induced\naerosol production and the ﬂuid mechanics of exhaled air movement.\n\u0002 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As a function of T (in 8C) and H (in %), it\ncorresponds to the following correlation\nmð2000Þ ¼ 2:9155\u00030:0796T þ 0:068H:\n(7)\n2.3. Drop impacts experiments\nAs described in Table 2, the drop impact experiments are\nconducted on glass, cardstock (Colorbok, textured white cardstock),\npolycarbonate and aluminum surfaces, which represent a range of\nnon-absorbing surfaces. Several values of surface roughness for\npolycarbonate and aluminum surfaces are obtained after grinding\nwith sand paper and subsequent rinsing with isopropanol and\ndeionized water. Then, to dry the targets, the aluminum surfaces are\nwiped with clean tissue, while only compressed air is used for\npolycarbonate to prevent the formation of static charge on the\nsurface.\nSurface roughness of the targets is measured using a 3D\nmicroscope (Hirox, Digital Microscope, KH-8700). The static\ncontact angle of the blood drops, on the targets, is measured\nusing ImageJ software [24]. A syringe pump (KD Scientiﬁc,\nKDS230) is used to create blood droplets, through FEP tubing\nand a 27 gauge blunt needle (corresponding to an average droplet\ndiameter of 2.47 mm, and a volume of 7.89 mL), as shown in\nFig. 3. Within 70% population interval, the uncertainty on the\nmeasured droplet diameter is 3.1%, and 6.2% for impact velocity.\nBlood is a complex ﬂuid and the following handling precautions\nhave been useful to reduce experimental uncertainties. The blood\nis continuously pumped (at 0.1 ml/min), without stopping, to\nprevent its drying at the needle outlet; drying of blood at the\nneedle outlet has been observed to modify drop diameter over\ntime. Correspondingly, a droplet is generated every 5 s. A small\ncontainer was placed under the needle to collect redundant\ndroplets generated between each trial of experiment. Droplet\nimpact velocity is altered by changing the droplet release height (5,\n10, 20, 60 and 150 cm). At each height, the needle is replaced to\nensure consistent nozzle condition. The targets are blown with\ncompressed air just before the start of the experiments to remove\nany residual dust particles. Series of 10 blood stains are created on\neach surface, at each height, to ensure repeatability of results. A\nhigh speed camera (Redlake MotionXtra HG-100 K) is used to\nrecord the droplet impact, while the dripping rate is kept constant.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe representative sequence of events during droplet impact\nand spreading on different targets is shown in Fig. 4. When the\ndroplet impacts normally on the surface, its inertia drives the liquid\nradially outwards, and this expansion is opposed by viscous\ndissipation in the blood and by surface tension at the blood–air\ninterface. At t = 2 ms, the droplet stretches the blood into a thin\nlayer called lamella, surrounded by a peripheral thicker ring called\nthe rim. About 3 ms after the impact, as the inertial forces weaken,\nthe droplet reaches a maximum spreading, whereafter capillary and\nviscous forces dominate. The liquid in the rim is brought back by\nsurface tension toward the vertical axis of symmetry. This recoiling\nphase\noccurs\nfor\n3 ms < t < 20 ms,\nand\ncorresponds\nto\nthe\ndissipation of the inertial forces by viscous forces. That phase\noccurs with contact line pinned to the target[7,11,25], except on\nglass as observed in Fig. 4. After the instance of maximum spreading\n(image (iv) in Fig. 4), the contact line remains pinned for the\naluminium, cardstock and polycarbonate targets, while the contact\nline on the glass target spreads further: this is attributed to the\n[(Fig._2)TD$FIG]\nFig. 2.

However, these methods do\nnot explain and consider how blood droplets form due to a\ngunshot. Rather, they take existing bloodstain patterns and\nreconstruct blood droplet trajectories without considering the\nphysical causes of droplet formation. This was mitigated in Refs.\n[41] and [42] by linking the resultant backward ﬂow ﬁeld of blood\nfrom a bullet impact to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, and then, to\nthe droplet formation and trajectories, determined by gravity, air\ndrag, and droplet-droplet aerodynamic interactions. The Rayleigh–\nTaylor instability arises when denser blood is accelerating towards\nlighter air [43], as is the case of blood backward spatter splashing\ndue to a gunshot. Recently, spatter patterns resulting from blood\ndroplets in the direction of bullet motion, i.e. forward spatter, was\nexplored in detail and shown to be fundamentally different from\nbackward spatter [44,45].\nIn the present work, the experimental investigations of Refs.\n[41] and [42] were expanded upon and directly compared with\ntheir respective predictive models. Moreover, the models are\nutilized to offer further insight by predicting the locations of the\nstain area corresponding to a 50% cumulative distribution and the\ngeometric centroid of the stains as a function of distance to\nimpingement. The experiments are described in Section 2, a brief\noverview of the predictive models is given in Section 3 along with\nthe comparison with the data and further insights, and ﬁnally,\nconclusions are drawn in Section 4.\n2. Experimental investigations\nThe experiments in this paper are a subset of an open source\ndata set of high-resolution (600 DPI) scanned images of blood\nspatter from a gunshot [46]. There, the experimental conditions\nare \ndescribed \nin \ndetail, \nand \nallows \nthe \nforensic \nscience\ncommunity to test their models on publicly available data.\nBackward spattered blood droplets due to a gunshot were\ncreated at the Izaak Walton League Park indoor shooting range\nin Ames, Iowa, USA. While the indoor shooting range provided\nquiescent air for the experiments, the environmental conditions\nvaried with the time of the year of the speciﬁc experiments.\nRelative humidity was measured between 44% and 76%, with a\nprecision of \u00035% and room temperature was between 14.5 and\n23.5 \u0001C. The riﬂe used was a 0.223 cal Rock River Arms, LAR-15\n1600 barrel M-4, ﬁt with a Yanki YHM Phantom 223 suppressor\nﬁring two different types of bullets, one hollow point, and the\nother full metal jacket. The hollow point bullet was a BEE\n0.224 cal with a 0.223 Remington casing, 26.5 grain BLC-2\npowder, and Winchester Small Riﬂe Primer. The full metal jacket\nbullet was a 5.56 mm caliber Federal Ammunition XM193 with a\nmass of 55 grain. The velocity of the hollow point bullet was\nmeasured with a chronograph as 897 m/s, and the full metal\njacket bullet was measured to be 922 m/s.\nThe bullets were shot at either a closed hollow cavity or\npolyurethane foam sheet ﬁlled with 10–13 mL of swine blood. For\nthe experiments conducted with the soaked foam target, the blood\nwas anticoagulated with ACD and had 41% hematocrit. The\ntemperature of the blood injected into the foam was 35 \u0003 2 oC.\nFor the experiments where blood was contained in a closed hollow\ncavity, the blood was used at room temperature and anti-\ncoagulated with heparin and had 38–39% hematocrit. In each\ncase, the blood was drawn two days before the experiment was\nconducted. A schematic of the experimental setup is depicted in\nFig. 1.\nHaving \nin \nmind \nthe \neffect \nof \nexpanding \nmuzzle \ngases\ninteracting with blood droplets in ﬂight [47], the experimental\nsetup was designed such that the bullet penetrated through a sheet\nof cardstock which acted as a diffuser to obstruct the muzzle gases\nfrom travelling downstream. The substrate which was impacted by\nthe blood droplets was smooth cardstock.\n3. Predictive models\nThe impact phenomenon of a bullet in which the backward\nspatter of blood results from is a short-term event. Given a bullet\npenetration depth of h \u0004 1 cm, and a bullet impact velocity of\nV0 \u0004 300 m=s, the penetration time is t \u0004 33 ms which indicates\nthat inertial forces dominate over the viscous ones. The strong,\nshort-term impact of \na \nblunt \nbullet \nresults in \nan \nalmost\ninstantaneous pressure ﬁeld which generates backward ﬂow in\nthe framework of potential impulsive ﬂow hydrodynamics with\npressure being the potential [48–50]. For a Newtonian viscous\nliquid, such an impulsive irrotational potential impact ﬂow sets in\nwhen the dimensionless group mu/(Lp) \u00051, where m is the\nviscosity, u is the ﬂuid velocity (in the ﬂow starting from rest), p is\nthe pressure acting on ﬂuid, and L is the characteristic length scale.\nOn the other hand, penetration of a sharp bullet proceeds under\ndominant inertial forces, and thus, is potential in the ordinary\nhydrodynamic sense. The latter case corresponds to the seminal\nWagner problem [50,51]. Potential ﬂows are irrotational and\nremain as such for the entire duration of the aforementioned ﬂows\nunder the conditions of Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem [48–50].\nAccordingly, the methods developed to predict backward\nsplashed blood ﬂow resulting from sharp [41] and blunt bullets\n[42] are based on their corresponding incompressible potential\nﬂows which satisfy the Laplace equation with appropriate\nboundary conditions. A diagram of the two cases with their\nvariable deﬁnitions is shown in Fig. 2.\nFor a blunt bullet the initial blood velocity, v, and acceleration,\nA, at the target surface are, respectively,\nv ¼ 2\npV0\na\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nr2 \u0006 a2\np\n\u0006 arcsin a\nr\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u0005 \n\u0006\n; \nð1Þ\nA ¼ 2\np\nV2\n0\nca\na\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nr2 \u0006 a2\np\n\u0006 arcsin a\nr\n\u0003 \u0004\n\u0005 \n\u0006\n; \nð2Þ\nwhere a is the radius of the edge of the blunt bullet, r is the radial\ncoordinate with the origin at the axis of symmetry, and c a\ndimensionless factor associated with the time scale of the\nimpulsive motion [42].\nFig. 1.

However, since Marangoni convection\nis occurring, the RBCs (and other heavy colloids) accumulate at the drop triple line,\nwhich is receding. The RBCs accumulate by Marangoni convection to form a solid\ndeposit which will be called hereafter ‘the corona’.

Several\nelongated droplets in the shape of ‘exclamation marks’ found on\nthe middle joint of the right index ﬁnger pointed approximately\ntowards the ﬁngertip. Similar, parallel patterns were detected on\nthe base joint, mostly with the same direction. Individual droplets\nat the inner part of the index ﬁnger were aligned towards the palm\nof the hand (Figs. 5 and 6). Additionally, round blood spatters were\nsituated on the ulnar side of the index ﬁnger as well as on the back\nof the hand.\nThe left hand showed round microspatter at the extensor side of\nthe thumb and index ﬁnger (Fig. 7). The palm of the hands showed\nno bloodstains.\n5. Discussion\nIn order to be able to reconstruct the events at a crime scene,\nforensic investigators study the shapes, sizes and distribution of\nbloodstains. Together with autopsy ﬁndings about injuries, a\nmedically and scientiﬁcally based reconstruction of possible\nwounding mechanisms is possible [5].\nBased primarily on the characteristics and location of the\nentrance wound and direction of bullet path, the presented case\nwould be classiﬁed as a suicide. [6] However, the ﬁnal position of\nthe weapon on the left side of the body in relation to the entrance\nwound on the right side of the head and intensive bloodstains on\nthe weapon and body was the cause of speculation about the\ncorrectness of this primary assumption.\nIn most cases, blood spatter on the hands of a victim or a\ndefendant are usually neglected in favour of those found at the\ncrime scene. Nevertheless, several publications show that the\nanalysis of backspatter is an important tool for mathematical and\nphysical modelling of blood spatter and thus enables the\nreconstruction of the gun’s position and the manner in which it\nhas been used [7–9].\nIn the case at hand, parallel bloodstains on the back of the right\nhand, thumb and index ﬁnger together with the discreetly visible\nstains on the extensor side of left thumb and index ﬁnger suggest\nthat the back of the right hand was directed away from the area of\norigin. Backspatter on the dorsal part of the thumb and index ﬁnger\nindicates that the blood was projected away from the wrist in an\noblique angle towards the inner part of the ﬁngers and palm of the\nhand and towards the ﬁngertips. Taking into account the fact that\nthe palm of the right hand was free from spatter, the weapon must\nhave been held backwards in the right hand with the right thumb\nembracing the trigger (Fig. 8a and b). This reconstruction is\nsupported by the extensive bloodstains on the index ﬁnger, as it is\nthe most prominent part at this precise position, facing away from\nFig. 1.

Earlier research has applied image \nprocessing techniques to the analysis of digital images of bloodstains to \nautomatically fit ellipses to the bloodstain shape and determine the \nimpact angle and orientation angle from the minor and major axes. \nHowever, the described methodologies were applied to images of single \nbloodstains [13–15] or the procedure required input from the analyst to \nselect the appropriate stains within a pattern [16,17]. More recently, \nresearchers have utilised the quantitative techniques of Matlab [18–20]\nor ImageJ [21–23] to the analysis of digital images of bloodstain pat­\nterns. While both methods can easily extract the number of stains and \ngive a measurement regarding their size, other BPA specific metrics are \nnot available such as the directionality of the stain (represented \nnumerically as the gamma angle), and the impact angle.\n1.1. Gamma and impact angles\nWhen a droplet lands on a target at an angle, the resultant stain is \nelliptical with the major (long) axis in alignment with the direction of \ntravel. Furthermore, as the blood droplet collapses and spreads across \nthe target a volume of the liquid can form a small wave that follows the \ndirection of travel of the droplet. This wave can spill over from the \ncontact line (the edge of the blood in the main parent stain) resulting in \nthin protrusions extending from the end of the parent elliptical stain \n[24]. Depending on the angle, droplet size and surface features, the \nprotrusions can be single (referred as a tail), multiple (referred to as \nspines) and/or fully detach from the parent stain (see Fig. 1). The \npresence of these tails or spines on one side of an elliptical stain is \nconsidered a reliable indicator for the direction of travel along the major \naxis, and by combining the orientation angle with the direction, the \ngamma angle can be determined. For example, a stain on a 45-degree \nangle with a right direction will have a gamma angle of 45 degrees. \nHowever, if the same stain’s directionality was left the gamma angle \nwould be 225 degrees (see Fig. 2) [1].\nWhilst the gamma angle can give information about the general di­\nrection a blood drop was travelling, the trajectory of the droplet can be \nestimated by including information on the angle the droplet impacted a \ntarget surface. It has been previously demonstrated that there is a rela­\ntionship between the width to length ratio of an elliptical stain and the \nangle of impact (α) of the droplet to the target. Perpendicular impacts \nresult in circular stains, more oblique angles result in more elongated \nelliptical stains. This relationship is shown in Eq.1 [25]. \nα = arcsin Width\nLength\n(1) \nAn accurate impact angle estimation relies on an accurate width and \nlength measurement. One of the challenges faced by BPA analysts is \naccurately measuring the elliptical shape of the parent stain when the \ntails and spines lengthen the final stain. Analysts are trained to ignore \nthese protrusions when estimating the length of the ellipse [26]. By \ncombining the estimated impact and gamma angles a straight-line tra­\njectory of the droplet can be determined. It is noted that the other \ninfluencing forces such as gravity and drag are ignored during this \nestimation.\nDetermining these angles for various stains can assist with grouping \nstains together as part of the same pattern/event and also can be used to \nlimit the positions of the blood source within a geometric space and \ntherefore assist with reconstruction of events at a scene. Most analysis at \ncrime scenes is still undertaken manually and each spatter pattern can \ncontain hundreds to thousands of stains. So, whilst the gamma and \nimpact angles are considered important features there is currently \nneither the time nor the resources to collect data on every individual \nstain.\nIn 2017 image processing techniques were applied to develop a \nmethodology that can automatically extract bloodstain pattern features \nfrom digital images [18]. Using Matlab R2015B the digital image of an \nimpact pattern was imported, the background subtracted, and the ob­\njects of interest (stains) segmented using the Triangle thresholding al­\ngorithm. To overcome the challenge of fitting accurate ellipses to stains \nwith spines, the researchers applied erosion and dilation morphological \noperations to remove small protrusions and background noise. Stains \ngreater than 10 pixels in both the original binarised image and the \neroded/dilated image were then mapped, linked and relevant mea­\nsurements computed using Matlab regionprops [18]. In this research the \ndirection of the stains was determined by locating the centroid of the \nellipse from the eroded/dilated image within the bounding box of the \noriginal stain. This along with the orientation angle was used to calcu­\nlate the gamma angle. Other BPA specific features were also computed. \nThese included shape features of the individual stains (tail to body ratio, \nwidth to length ratio, area of stain to area of convex hull ratio (regularity \nmeasure), ratio of perimeter of inscribed circle to perimeter of stain, \nstain size and stain intensity. Five pattern features were also calculated: \noverall directionality, convergence, linearity, circularity of pattern, \nstain density.\nSubsequently this methodology was applied to a limited number of \nlaboratory generated impact and cast-off patterns [27] and the results \nanalysed. A combination of five of the above-described features were \nfound to be optimal for distinguishing between these two classes of \npatterns. Although demonstrating a promising approach to the appli­\ncation of an automated system to the analysis of spatter patterns, Matlab \nlicences are expensive and not all researchers and BPA analysts have \neasy access to this platform. Furthermore, the fixed thresholding values \ndid not work well when the methodology was applied to further labo­\nratory generated spatter patterns created in our research facilities and \nthe system was slow to analyse patterns with thousands of stains [28].\nWe present an Automated Bloodstain Pattern Analysis method \n(ABPA method) that improves on the previous methodology described \n[18], increasing the detection of the small stains present in the patterns, \nand computing more suitable BPA specific metrics that have been \ndeveloped based on the results of prior research [27,28] and on an un­\nderstanding of the fluid mechanics underpinning the formation of blood \nspatter patterns. This application has been implemented in Python, \nimporting modules including numpy, matplotlib, and Open CV for easy \nimplementation of image segmentation and analysis. Python has the \nbenefit of being a free open-source language that is readily available to \nresearchers, academics and analysts, making the method more acces­\nsible than Matlab.\n2.

This study proposes that bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation can become a distinct\nand logical process by implementing an automated approach. To do this, an automated bloodstain\npattern recognition system was developed to enable the distinction of two types of spatter bloodstain\npatterns. First, global pattern features based on common bloodstain pattern properties were extracted\nfrom laboratory-generated impact spatter and cast-off bloodstain patterns. Following this, automated\nfeature selection methods were used to identify the combination of features that best distinguished the\ntwo bloodstain pattern types. This eventually led to the training and testing of a Fisher quadratic\ndiscriminant classiﬁer using separate subsets of the generated bloodstain patterns. When applied to the\ntraining dataset, a 100% classiﬁcation precision resulted. An independent dataset comprising of\nbloodstain patterns generated on paint and wallpaper substrates were used to validate the performance\nof the classiﬁer. An error rate of 2% was obtained when the classiﬁer was applied to these bloodstain\npatterns. This automated bloodstain pattern recognition system offers considerable promise as an\nobjective classiﬁcation methodology which up to now, the discipline has lacked. With further reﬁnement,\nincluding testing it over a wider range of bloodstain patterns, it could provide valuable quantitative data\nto support analysts in their task of classifying bloodstain patterns.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nRecognising patterns based on a sizeable body of knowledge\nthat has been stored in the human mind is regarded as a\nprerequisite to human expert decision-making [1]. Humans\nhave developed sophisticated methods of sensing and inter-\npreting patterns in the environment. Pattern recognition is\ncentral to a number of forensic disciplines including bloodstain\npattern analysis (BPA). The recognition of bloodstain patterns\nrelies primarily on the identiﬁcation of the pattern’s diagnostic\nproperties and an evaluation of the possible mechanisms by\nwhich the pattern was deposited. Together these form the\nprocess bloodstain pattern analysts term pattern classiﬁcation.\nThe limitations of pattern classiﬁcation as currently practiced, are\nthe qualitative nature of determining the properties of the pattern\nand the subjective judgement required to infer the pattern’s causal\nevent [2,3]. It is evident that this process encourages the formation\nof early mechanistic conclusions about the cause of a pattern\nbefore a full set of observations has been made [4]. This problem is\nexacerbated by the use of standard discipline terminology [5],\nwhich is largely mechanism-based. In fact, BPA taxonomies [6,7]\nform the backbone of bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation. So the\nboundary between observation and interpretation or reconstruc-\ntion can become blurred [8]. A key reason for this and other\npersisting issues, is the lack of a rigorous and standardised BPA\nmethodology [3,8]. Deﬁning a formal BPA methodology is the\nsubject of ongoing discussion among BPA practitioners [9–11].\nComputers offer a wide range of capabilities that can both assist\nand emulate human decision-making. Pattern recognition has\nbeen deﬁned as the study of how computers observe the\nenvironment, learn to distinguish patterns of interest and make\nreasonable decisions about different categories of patterns [12].\nPattern recognition systems can be based on identifying the pre-\n* Corresponding author at: The University of Auckland, School of Chemical\nSciences, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: ravishkaa@gmail.com (R.M.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative.

Introduction\nThe emission of light observed when a solution containing\nluminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazine-dione or, more\nsimply, 3-aminophthalhydrazide) and hydrogen peroxide is\nsprayed on dried bloodstains has been utilised by forensic sci-\nentists in investigations involving violent crime for more than\n40 years. This article reviews the current understanding of the\nchemistry and mechanism of the luminol reaction as it pertains to\nthe detection of bloodstains. A forensic overview of operational\nuse of the luminol reaction will be given including a discus-\nsion of interfering species and the possible detrimental effect of\nluminol on further presumptive tests for blood and DNA typing\nanalyses.\n1.1. Chemiluminescence\nChemiluminescence [1] refers to the emission of light from\na chemical reaction, which can occur in solid, liquid or gas\nsystems. The fundamentals of chemiluminescence have been\ncomprehensively reviewed in a number of textbooks and articles\nin recent years [2–5].\nTwo main categories of chemiluminescent reaction have been\ndescribed in the literature, direct and indirect. Direct chemilu-\nminescence can be represented by:\nA + B →[I]∗→PRODUCTS + LIGHT\nwhere A and B are reactants and [I]* is an excited state inter-\nmediate. The luminol reaction is an example of this form of\nchemiluminescence. In certain cases where the excited state is\nan inefﬁcient emitter, its energy may be passed on to another\nspecies (a sensitizer, F) for light emission to be observed. This\nis called “indirect chemiluminescence” and is exempliﬁed by\nthe peroxyoxalate (light stick) reaction:\nA + B →[I]∗+ F →[F]∗→F + LIGHT\nOnce a molecule has been converted to a metastable interme-\ndiate in an excited state there are a number of routes by which\nit can return to the ground state. These routes can be displayed\ndiagrammatically, as in Fig. 1, by an “energy well” diagram, or\nmore simply by the Jablonski diagram, ﬁrst introduced in the\n1930s. The light emission can either be ﬂuorescence or chemi-\nluminescence, if from a singlet state, or phosphorescence if from\na triplet state.\nThe light emitted from chemiluminescent reactions has dif-\nfering degrees of intensity, lifetime and wavelength with the\nlatter parameter covering the spectrum from near ultraviolet,\nthrough the visible and into the near infrared.\nFor emission to be observed from a chemical reaction, three\nessential energetic requirements need to be met:\n1. There should be an energetically favourable reaction path-\nway for the production of the excited state species. Of the\ntotal number of molecules participating in the reaction a\nsigniﬁcant number should reach the excited state.\n2. Thereactionisrequiredtobeexothermic,withthefreeenergy\nchange being in the range 170–300 kJ mol−1.\n3. Thereshouldbeafavourabledeactivationpathwayforchemi-\nluminescence emission, with other competitive non-radiative\nprocesses such as intra- or intermolecular energy transfer,\nmolecular dissociation, isomerization or physical quenching\nkept to a minimum.\nThe intensity of the chemiluminescence emission from a\nreaction is dependant upon the rate of reaction and the efﬁciency\nof the process generating excited state species. The latter can\nbe described by the chemiluminescence quantum yield, ΦCL,\nwhich is deﬁned as:\nΦCL = total number of photons emitted\nnumber of molecules reacting\nFig. 1.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

The purpose of this study is to determine the \napproximate location of the blood source, i.e. the victim, at the crime scene by using an image processing and \nnumerical modeling approach. To achieve this, an experimental setup is designed with cardstocks and a cow \nblood-soaked sponge. In total, twenty forward spatter patterns are obtained onto cardstocks after successful \nshootings. In the post-processing phase, ellipses on the cardstocks are detected by processing the forward spatters \nin MATLAB. To achieve this, ellipse properties are identified for calculating the impact angles. The impact angles \nare then utilized as inputs to the tangent method within the program to estimate the Area of Origin (AOx). For \nvisualization, 2D and 3D images are generated. In conclusion, it is observed that the program works the best in \ndetermining the AOx, for the scenarios where the real AOx distances (blood source to target distances) are 35 cm, \n50 cm, and 100 cm respectively. The program’s weakness while determining AOx for the source distance of 5 cm \nis also reported. It is necessary to improve the program for short blood source-to-target distances and long \nshooting distances. It can be concluded that image quality is also a key factor for post-processing as it might \nmislead the results with visible ellipses.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstains are one of the most significant types of physical evidence \nand can greatly help to establish the connection between the culprit, the \nvictim, and the crime scene. The formation of the stains depends on \nphysical, environmental, and biological factors and can appear in \nvarious sizes and forms [1]. Patterns resulting from a force applied \ndirectly to the source of blood are referred to as impact spatter. Such \nspatters may be caused by firearms, blunt objects, stabbing, electrical \ndevices, or explosions [1]. The size of bloodstains is typically less than \n1 mm or larger, and the velocity of the applied force can start at 30 m/s. \nHowever, there is no direct correlation between stain size and the ve­\nlocity of the applied force [2]. By analyzing the spatter bloodstains, the \nfollowing questions can be answered regarding the crime scene: \n• Possible location and position of the culprit, the victim, and other \nobjects at the scene\n• Chronological order of events\n• Verification or refutation of statements made by the victim, wit­\nnesses, or culprit\nThere are a variety of software and algorithms developed in the \nliterature for the location of the blood source, i.e. Area of Origin (AO) \nestimation in bloodstain pattern analysis [3]. The aim of these methods \nis to estimate AO based on the size, shape and directionality of blood­\nstains. The string method is a well-known traditional method that uses \nphysical strings to determine the AO. This method is time-consuming, \nand its accuracy depends on the performer. Modern approaches use \nprimarily image processing and numerical modeling. The currently \navailable and most used programs include HemoSpat, Sherlock, Back­\nTrack, HemoVision, FARO Scene [3]. In the study by Arthur et al. \nMATLAB was used to analyze bloodstain patterns. Digital images were \nprocessed and basic features such as eccentricity, major and minor axis \nlengths, orientation, area and center of mass were calculated using the \nregionprops function. The methodology involved preparing digital im­\nages, isolating the bloodstains by applying segmentation and \n* Corresponding author at: Forensic Science Department, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Üsküdar University, ˙Icadiye, Ba˘glarbas¸ı Cd.

Impact events typically produce an array of\nliquid sheets and ligaments and other amorphous shaped volumes of\nliquid, many of which eventually equilibrate into spherical drops.\nDepending on their progress towards equilibrium, these volumes of\nliquid can form irregularly-shaped elements.

These studies try to cir-\ncumvent this problem by taking the number of spines, created around the stain, into account. However, \nrecently we showed that it is possible to determine the volume of a dried bloodstain and that it is possible \nto calculate the volume of the original droplet prior to impact8. Accordingly, we developed a method \nwhich can be used to determine the impact velocity based on the width of an elliptical bloodstain and its \noriginal volume9. In this study, we show for the first time that it is possible to determine the volume of \nbloodstains from a real impact pattern and infer the impact velocity of each stain chosen by the expert. \nMore importantly, we show that with this method we are able to take both gravity and drag into account \nwhen determining the trajectory of a blood droplet, and determine the region of origin of an impact \npattern much more precise and accurate than the methods currently in use. This research enables the \ninvestigator to determine the location of the blood source in the room, and connect it to the position \nof the victim (like standing or sitting), or connect specific wounds to certain patterns. To determine the \nregion of origin by taking gravity and drag into account, we require five parameters of each bloodstain: 1) \nlocation of the bloodstain in x, y, and z coordinates, 2) directional angle γ, 3) impact angle α, 4) volume \nof the original blood droplet, and 5) impact velocity of the blood droplet. The first parameter is trivial \nand measured easily, which is done for the current methods in use. The directional angle γ is measured \nby comparing the direction of travel to the vertical (Fig. 1b,c). The impact angle α can be determined \nfrom the shape of the stain as the width Wmax and length Lmax of the elliptical outline of the stain (Fig. 1c) \nare empirically related to the impact angle by sinα =  Wmax/Lmax\n10. It is possible to determine the volume \nof a bloodstain8, however this has never been done before with bloodstains of an impact pattern. We \nwill show that by means of a 3D surface scanner we can determine the volume of small (≈ 1 μl) blood-\nstains in a non-intrusive and objective manner (see supplementary materials). For the final parameter, \nthe impact velocity, recent studies for simple fluids suggest that it can be inferred from the maximum \ndiameter that an impacting drop of known volume attains5,9–13. During impact upon a surface, droplets \nspread in a circular fashion, where spreading is driven by inertial forces and countered by capillary and \nviscous forces9,14,15. These forces can be quantified in terms of the Weber number, We =  ρD0v2/σ, the ratio \nbetween the inertial and capillary force, and the Reynolds number Re =  ρD0v/η, the ratio between the \ninertial and viscous forces. Here ρ denotes the density of the fluid, D0 the diameter of the droplet in flight, \nv the impact velocity of the droplet, σ the surface tension and η the viscosity of the fluid. As spreading \nslows down, the spreading droplet reaches its maximum diameter, after which it can either retract due to \nthe capillary forces15 or remain pinned to the surface16, which is the case for blood droplets17. Recently, \nLaan et al.9 showed that spreading of droplets in general, including blood droplets, can be described by \nFigure 1.  Example of a bloodstain impact pattern with a detailed photograph of a single bloodstain. \n(a) Impact pattern created by means of a hammer on spring released into a volume of blood.

These\ncalculations are only made for bloodstains whose spatial impact direction\ncontradict the results of the stringing method. For such a blood drop, we know\nthe horizontal distance to the expected source area (by the stringing method), the\nimpact angle and its mass. These data determine the angle of departure of the blood\ndrop within a certain range. We then search for the starting velocity that is\nnecessary to have the same starting height as the expected source area. If this\nvelocity is much higher than the possible travelling velocity for blood drops as\nexplained at Section 2.4, then it is very probable that the bloodstain in question\ncannot come from the expected point and we have to look for another source. In the\ncase where the velocity is lower the mentioned limit, it is quite possible that this\ndrop came from the expected source.\nTrajectory calculations can be done with any exterior ballistics software which\ncontains the air drag coefﬁcient function of the sphere.

All centres were sited above the pillow, two or\nthree between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress in the middle of\nthe pillow (group 1) and two centres on the right-side of the pillow,\ncloser to the wall and up to 10 cm higher (group 2) (Figs. 6 and 7).\nThe centres are the possible blood source locations and the groups\nthe different locations of the head of the victim.\nThe bloodstains of group 2 overlapped the bloodstains of group\n1 (Fig. 8). Therefore, the stains in group 2 arose after those in group\n1, which meant that the head of the victim was ﬁrst sited in the\ncentres of group 1 and then lifted and moved to the centres of\ngroup 2.\n[(Fig._5)TD$FIG]\nFig. 5.

Impact events typically produce an array of\nliquid sheets and ligaments and other amorphous shaped volumes of\nliquid, many of which eventually equilibrate into spherical drops.\nDepending on their progress towards equilibrium, these volumes of\nliquid can form irregularly-shaped elements.

Digital photography and microscopy\nAfter each experiment, all pieces of fabric were allowed to air\ndry completely before proceeding to photography. A CANNON EOS\n7D 18.0 Megapixel digital SLR camera along with four large ﬂood\nlights (to provide even illumination) attached to a copy stand were\nused to capture low magniﬁcation digital images of the overall\npattern on the fabric.\nMicroscopic images of randomly selected areas of each pattern\nwere taken by reﬂection microscope (Leica DM 2500 M micro-\nsystem) at 10\u0002 magniﬁcation. The presence or absence of blood was\neasily discernible because of the high contrast with the white fabric.\nA minimum of 20 microscopic images was acquired for each trial\nreplicate. For both types of fabric, there were 10 replicates of spatter\npatterns, and 10 replicates of transfer patterns generated from both\nleather and glass respectively, yielding 2 \u0002 3 \u0002 10 \u0002 20 = 1200\nmicroscopic images.\nEach microscopic image was analyzed by manually counting\nthe number of stained left loop legs and the number of stained right\nloop legs. A loop leg that had approximately 75% or more of its\nvisible surface area stained with blood was counted as one stained\nloop leg. Smaller specks of blood and partially coated loop legs\n(i.e., with less than 75% coverage) were ignored. We emphasize\nthat this deﬁnition was arbitrary, i.e., one could choose a different\nthreshold, and that different analysts might perceive the same loop\nleg to be more or less than 75% covered. To test whether analyst-to-\nanalyst variation was signiﬁcant, we chose a representative set of\n18 images at random and had ﬁve additional forensic science\nstudents count the number of stained loop legs in each image. The\ndetails are presented in the supplementary material, but the\nmain ﬁnding was that student analysts with de minimis training\nobtained agreement on their stained loop leg counts on average to\nwithin 5.7%. As discussed below this variability is small compared\nto the detected percent discrepancies between direct contact and\nspatter.\n2.3. Microscopic analysis of the fabric topography\nA Zeta-20 Optical Proﬁler Microscope System was used to\nexamine the topography of the fabric surfaces. The Zeta-20 system\nallowed simultaneous 2D and 3D (confocal) imaging of the surfaces\nand provided a way of quantifying the height variation between\nadjacent loop legs. For each fabric type, ﬁve images of randomly\nselected areas were taken and scanned. In each image, three cross-\nsectional proﬁles lines of equal length were drawn across a\nminimum of 5 alternating loop legs in a row. Thus, 15 rows of loop\nlegs per fabric type were analyzed.\n3. Results\n3.1. Microscopic images of spatter versus contact transfer patterns\nFig. 3 shows representative low magniﬁcation images of spatter\nand contact transfer patterns. Fig. 3a is a representative image of\nspatter pattern formed by a single spray of porcine blood sample\ndirectly onto the 100% cotton fabric, while Fig. 3b and c shows\ntransfer patterns generated by contacting the fabric with blood\nsprayed onto leather and glass respectively. The spatter and\ntransfer bloodstain patterns qualitatively look similar and are\ndifﬁcult to differentiate simply by visual inspection, at least at\nlow magniﬁcation.\nFig. 2.

    "text_chunk": "It is commonly understood that the assumption of straight\ntrajectories is not expected to induce systematic errors in the\ndetermination of the region of convergence, which we deﬁne as in\n[9,10], as the projection of the region of origin on a horizontal\nsurface (e.g. the ﬂoor). Some analysts determine the region of\nconvergence in the plane of the spatter pattern, which can be of\nany orientation, but like the two well-cited works above, we use a\nhorizontal plane where the projections of the trajectories are not\naffected by gravity. Certainly, methods neglecting gravity and drag\nforces cause systematic errors in the height determination of the\nregion of origin [11,12]. For instance, [13] showed experimentally\nthat doing so “over-estimates the point of origin and the error\nassociated with this technique is signiﬁcant (50% on average).”\nSuch error is signiﬁcant enough to wrongly conclude that a person\nwas standing when in fact they may have been sitting. The\nmagnitude of this error is difﬁcult to estimate, because it arises\nfrom the use of a physically inconsistent model. It has been\nconjectured in [14] that “a satisfactory reconstruction” is achieved\nusing straight trajectories if the region of origin is determined\n“within the volume of a grapefruit, or even a basketball”, but there\nis no universally accepted method to determine the uncertainty\nassociated with the method of strings.\nHere, we focus on the common situation where the spatter\npattern is found on a vertical wall, as depicted in Fig. 1. A\ndescription of the method of strings for stains on a vertical wall is\ngiven by Carter [9].\nRecently, a probabilistic approach has been proposed by Camana\n[10] to determine the region of convergence. The method relies on\nthe propagation of measurement uncertainties to the horizontal\nprojections of the trajectories, and constructs a joint probability\ndensity function describing the probability that convergence would\nbe within a given spatial region. Of interest is that the method\ngenerates a probabilistic map for the area of convergence, directly\nlinking the angles of impact and their uncertainties, to the region of\nconvergence and its area. In other words, [10] proposes for the ﬁrst\ntime a rational method to estimate the magnitude of the uncertainty\naround the most likely point of convergence. The ability to rationally\nprovide the uncertainty of a measurement is an important\ncomponent in expert testimony.\nIn parallel, several approaches have been proposed to consider\nthe effects of drag and gravity on the backward trajectories in BPA.\nBuck et al. [15] reconstructed drop trajectories with a modiﬁed\nballistic model, considering gravity and drag forces. In their ballistic\nanalysis, they screened a range of velocity values for compatibility\nwith the preservation of the drop during the ﬂight, since higher\nvelocities result in drop breakup when drag forces overcome the\nsurface tension. While an incorrect assumption on the ﬂuid\ndynamics of drop impact associated with their analysis is discussed\nin [16], the present work is inspired by their work. A statistical\nprocedure [17] based on aggregate statistics and basic equations of\nprojectile motion has been shown to determine the region of origin\nof a blood spatter pattern for cases when the spatter is launched\nwithin a narrow range of polar angles — which is the case in, e.g.\narterial gushing, but not in beatings or shootings [18]. Attinger et al.\n[11] proposed a method to reconstruct the ballistic trajectory of a\nblood drop considering gravity and drag forces. By measuring the\nvolume and shape of the bloodstain on the substrate, the diameter\nand the velocity of the original drop could be estimated. Such a\nmethod was implemented in [19,20], independently. While\ntheoretically portable to crimes scenes, that approach is of limited\nuse, because it requires a high-resolution 3D scanning of blood-\nstains, surfaces which are both non-absorbing and with roughness\nsigniﬁcantly smaller than typical stain thickness (10–100 mm). Also,\nstains are assumed not to contain internal voids, an assumption that\nis not always correct [4]. Very recently, Comiskeyet al. [21] proposed\na method to predict trajectories resulting from gunshot spatter\npatterns, accounting for the effect of air entrainment in the cloud of\natomized drops and the aerodynamic drop-drop interaction. While\nthe latter effect might be important near the origin, it is not clear at\nthis time how this time-forward method can be used to reconstruct\ntrajectories backward in time.\nIn this manuscript, we extend the probabilistic approach of\nCamana [10], aimed at ﬁnding the region of convergence of a blood\nspatter pattern in a 2D space, to the determination of the region of\norigin in a 3D space. The core idea of the proposed method is as\nfollows: for each stain of interest, impact angles are estimated from\nthe orientation and ellipticity of the stain. Then, ﬂuid dynamics\narguments determine a ﬁnite range of possible impact conditions (as\nproposed in [15]) in terms of pairs of drop diameters and velocities,\nwhich correspond to a ﬁnite range of possible backward trajectories.\nThose ﬂuid dynamics arguments consider drop deformation and\nbreakup during ﬂight and impact, the latter being visible by\ninspection of the periphery of the stain. Then, we statistically\nidentify a 3D region from which the physically sound trajectories\nmostprobablyoriginate.Thatregioniscalledtheregionoforigin,and\ndeﬁned not as a point but as a series of nested volumes. Those\nvolumes can be represented as a set of Russian dolls, the smaller\ninternal ones corresponding to a region of origin determined with a\nlower probability than the larger ones. Analogous to [10], the\nproposed method propagates measurement uncertainties and\ndetermines the volume of the region of origin based on ﬂuid\ndynamics and statistics, for the spatter pattern of interest.\nHereafter, we describe the method mathematically, and apply it\nto published blood spatter pattern data [5] on vertical walls.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Blood preparation and other experimental details\nThe blood preparation and experimental methods are described\nin detail in the published, open-source data set [5] of impact\nblood spatter patterns and are only brieﬂy discussed here.

The coordinate system used in this manuscript\nis mentioned, with subscript “o” indicating the origin of the blood, and “0” being\nthe origin of the coordinate trihedron. Indicated are the region of origin – the\nlocation where the blood was atomized – and its projection on a horizontal plane,\nthe region of convergence.\n324 \nD.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck.

Prior studies have demonstrated that the size and shape of a bloodstain on a smooth surface are\ndetermined from impact dynamics and to a lesser degree by the target material itself. Yet, these studies\nhave relied on clean surfaces, and it is unclear whether the presence of microscopic coatings and residues\ncould signiﬁcantly alter the size or shape of the dried stain. Here, in the present work, experiments are\nconducted to demonstrate that various coatings, such as the sebaceous residue from a latent ﬁngerprint,\ncan dramatically alter the size and shape of the stain from the moment of impact through the drying\nprocess. These experiments also highlight that a drop impacting a tilted superhydrophobic-coating glass\nsubstrate can cause the blood drop to completely recoil without leaving a stain. Relying on a combination\nof high-speed and time-lapse photography, the speciﬁc stages in the stain evolution responsible for the\ndeviations from the current models are identiﬁed. At a relatively low impact velocity, the stain sizes on\nthe coated glass surfaces were 35–72% smaller than on the clean glass surface. At a higher impact velocity,\nthe stains on the coated surfaces were not only smaller, but also contained drop spatter around the\nprimary stain that was not observable in the absence of the microscopic coatings. The reduction in\nbloodstain size did not appreciably change when a chemical was added to deactivate the anticoagulant\nand allow the blood to clot.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nFor over a century, blood pattern analysis (BPA) has been used\nby forensic scientists with the intention of reconstructing crime\nscenes [1–8] using the evidence in court to either provide missing\ndetails or to challenge or support a witness's testimony. In\nsituations where blood spatter is present, the size of blood stains\nare often associated with the force involved, whereas the shape\nand location of the stains can provide insight into an approximate\narea of origin [9]. Here detectives use a stringing technique to ﬁnd a\nregion of origin by assuming blood drops follow straight lines [10],\nan assumption that can overestimate the height by tens of\ncentimeters [11,8]. Within the last decade, methods have been\ndeveloped to back out the in-ﬂight parabolic trajectories of the\ndrops that account for gravitational and drag effects [12]. To apply\nthese methods, accurate estimate for the initial drop size and\nimpact velocity are required.\nNumerous studies have been carried out to relate the drop\nsize \nand \nimpact \nvelocity \nto \nthe \nﬁnal \nsize \nand \nshape \nof\nbloodstain [13–17]. \nThese \nstudies \ntypically \nrelate \nimpact\nconditions with the number of spines radiating from the dried\ndrop [13] or—in the absence of spines—with the stain size\nitself [15]. These relations appear to depend predominantly on\nthe impact conditions [16], with some corrections based on the\ntarget properties [14,17]. Thus, under the same impact conditions,\nthe bloodstain size might differ if the target were glass as opposed\nto polycarbonate. It is noteworthy that in almost all experiments\ninvestigating bloodstains, the target is cleaned before impact.\nHowever, at a crime scene, a surface may have unknown coatings\nor contaminants which may be invisible to the eye. For example, a\nwindow pane may be coated with ﬁngerprints, a kitchen counter\nwith a microscopic layer of oil, or a storefront with commercially-\navailable, superhydrophobic, anti-grafﬁti paint [18]. Here, a natural\nquestion \narises: \ncan \nthe \npresence \nof \nmicroscopic \ncoatings\nfundamentally alter the size or shape of the dried stain?\nThis study investigates the effect of microscopic coatings on the\nﬁnal bloodstain size and shape from the vertical impact of a single\ndrop of human blood.

Recently, several attempts have been\nmade at reconstructing ballistic trajectories backwards, considering the effects of gravity and drag forces.\nHere, we propose a method toreconstructthe regionof origin ofimpact bloodspatterpatternsthat considers\nﬂuid dynamics and statistical uncertainties. The ﬂuid dynamics relies on deﬁning for each stain a range of\nphysically possible trajectories, based on known physics of how drops deform, both in ﬂight and upon\nslanted impact. Statistical uncertainties are estimated and propagated along the calculations, and a\nprobabilistic approach is used to determine the region of origin as a volume most compatible with the\nbackward trajectories. A publicly available data set of impact spatter patterns on a vertical wall with various\nimpactor velocities and distances to target is used to test the model and evaluate its robustness, precision,\nand accuracy. Results show that the proposed method allows reconstruction of bloodletting events with\ndistances between thewall andblood source largerthan \u00011 m. The uncertaintyof themethod is determined,\nand its dependency on the distance between the blood source and the wall is characterized. Causes of error\nand uncertainty are discussed. The proposed method allows the consideration of stains indicating impact\nvelocities that point downwards, which are typically not used for determining the height of the origin. Based\non the proposed method, two practical recommendations on crime scene documentation are drawn.\n© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is one of many techniques of\nforensic science and crime scene investigation [1,2]. Besides the\ndetermination of the mechanisms causing speciﬁc collections of\nstains (patterns), BPA also aims at reconstructing blood spatter\npatterns — patterns generated by impact of airborne drops on a\ntarget surface. For spatter patterns, the determination of the 3D\nlocation of the spatter producing event \u0003 the region of origin \u0003 is\nrelevant to criminal cases. Note that the term region of origin used\nthroughout the manuscript departs from current standards [3] in\nBPA, which recommend area of origin. We ﬁnd that term confusing\nbecause of its 2D technical meaning, while the origin of a spatter is\nclearly a 3D region of space which the work in this manuscript\nidentiﬁes and measure as a volume. As translated from the 1939\nextensive and seminal BPA study of Balthazard et al., “The problem\nof reconstructing curved trajectories is very difﬁcult to solve” [4].\nIndeed, proper backward reconstruction of the trajectory of a\nsingle drop relies on the determination of the three impact velocity\ncomponents, as well as the drop volume, the latter necessary for\nthe consideration of drag forces along the trajectory.\nBackward trajectory reconstruction typically involves the\nfollowing steps: (1) the inspection of the roughness, cleanliness\nand wickability of the target surface, the surface where the stains\nare located; (2) the selection of a sufﬁcient and tractable number of\nstains out of many (sometimes more than 10,000 [5]) blood stains\nat the target surface; (3) the measurement of size, shape and\norientation of those stains; (4) the inference of impact conditions\nbased on measurements in (3); and (5) the backward reconstruc-\ntion of drop trajectories compatible with the stains and impact\nconditions; and (6) the identiﬁcation of a region of origin in 3D\nspace. Current trajectory reconstruction methods [6] are called the\nmethod of strings or the tangent method, and assume that blood\ndrops travel in straight trajectories from the area of origin to the\ntarget surface. Software based on same method and assumptions is\navailable and used in crime scenes [7,8].\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: attinger@iastate.edu (D.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Recent studies [49–­52] have shown \nthat classification in BPA typically has error rates of about 10%. \nThese numbers are difficult to interpret, because the data used in \nthe studies are not publicly available. Recently, a larger study [53] \nconfirmed the above error rates, while providing more information \non the data and methods. Let us stress that a reduction in the error \nrates by several orders of magnitude is needed to make the related \nanalyses and LRs significant in court. Considering both of these di-\nmensions (level on the hierarchy and nature of the knowledge used), \nit is clear that assignment of LR in BPA is in the complex realm. Thus, \nBPA specialists currently borrow more from their personal experi-\nence than from structured and published data.\n4  |  PROPOSITION OF THREE DIRECTIONS \nTO FACILITATE THE USE OF LRS IN BPA\nDespite the inherent difficulty that the scope of BPA is about activi-\nties rather than source, it seems possible to develop BPA along the \nthree directions below to facilitate and widen its use of LRs. Note \nthat, a clear benefit of the proposed directions is to root the BPA \nassessment in a logical and transparent process, a form of evidence-­\nbased assessment more than opinion-­based.\n4.1  |  Proposed direction 1: Better understand the \nphysics associated with BPA\nThe branch of physics describing the complex events connecting \nthe cause of a blood pattern and the pattern itself is called fluid \ndynamics. It describes how a bullet atomizes blood; how the im-\npact of a fist on a moving face squeezes and splashes blood; how \nairborne droplets move along trajectories curved by gravity and \nslowed by drag; and how drops spread, wick, and dry onto ma-\nterials as complex as fabrics. Only recently, peer-­reviewed fluid \ndynamic studies have started to uncover the complex physics \nunderlying BPA [54–­72]. The governing equations of fluid dynam-\nics are called the Navier–­Stokes equations; they are the expres-\nsion of Newton's second law for fluids. These equations involve \nnonlinear and dissipative terms. As their name suggests, nonlin-\near terms such as inertial forces exhibit a nonlinear relationship \nbetween cause and effect. Linear extrapolations of uncertainties \nfrom experiments under specific conditions to casework involving \ndifferent conditions may therefore lead to large, unknown errors. \nNonlinearity thus makes the design of experiments and databases \ncomplicated. Effects of dissipative terms such as viscous dissipa-\ntion or species diffusion are that information about the initial con-\nditions of a bloody event may be lost during the evolution of the \nresulting blood pattern. Even the rheology of blood, the descrip-\ntion of the fundamental mechanisms by which viscous dissipation \noccurs, is a topic of current studies [65,73,74]. It is currently not \nfully clear whether the blood substitutes used for BPA research \nand training behave like fresh blood [74] in several situations of \ninterest. These difficulties currently limit the ability to reconstruct \n(going backward in time to identify the causes) a crime scene and \nto provide corresponding evaluative statements.\nFor instance, one could argue that information on the average \nsize of the stains would tell whether a spatter is caused by a gunshot \nor the impact of, for example, a baseball bat. This argument has been \nmade [41] in the past. It has been recently shown that this distinction \nis not straightforward [75], and even quite inaccurate in situations \ninvolving muzzle gases interacting with droplets [76]. Certainly, a \ndeeper knowledge of the physics involved (as per horizontal axis of \nFigure 1) would improve the ability to associate patterns with their \nphysical cause.\n4.2  |  Proposed direction 2: Create public \ndatabases of BPA patterns, and/or make existing \ndatabases public\nThere is tradition and increased trend in various scientific disciplines \nto make data publicly, freely, and widely available, but this is not \nyet the case in BPA. Only few BPA databases are publicly available \n[53,77–­80]. Similarly, lots of peer-­reviewed BPA studies produce \nconclusions on the basis of bloodstain pattern data that are not ac-\ncessible. The open sharing of data is useful for peer review and nec-\nessary to support the determination of rarity and significance of a \nconclusion. Developing a culture of sharing and publishing BPA data, \neither scattered, specific, or organized in databases, will contribute \nto an open science attitude that is much needed in forensic science \n[81]. This effort may not only involve experimental results from \nforensic researchers, but also involve casework data from forensic \npractitioners.\n4.3  |  Proposed direction 3: Develop BPA training \nmaterial that discusses the likelihood ratio and its \nrelated statistical foundations\nThe widely used BPA book by James et al. [5] does not mention \nthe concept of likelihood ratio and recommends to perform ex-\nperiments to demonstrate that traces are “consistent” with an \nactivity, involving blood transfer, swinging a bloody object, tim-\ning of the event, a beating, blows, or stab wounds, a given posi-\ntion of a victim raising their arms, or high velocity spatter. Doing \nso gives BPA the role of supporting one of either the prosecu-\ntion or the defense theses, without assigning weight to the find-\nings in the context of both propositions. Indeed, the chapter on \ncourt testimony in Ref. [5] mentions that experts often influence \na verdict and remind the reader that the weight of the evidence \nis decided by the jury or judge.

Introduction\nA \ndetailed \nunderstanding \nof \nblood \ndynamics \nand \nstain\nformation is an essential prerequisite to the interpretation of\nboth individual bloodstains and spatter patterns. Within the\nliterature there is a fairly large body of work on both the spreading\nof liquids following droplet impact and on the splash features that\nmay also be formed in those circumstances. In only a few notable\ncases has blood been the subject of such study and the forensic\ncontext been considered. Consequently there is a need, not only for\na review of recent theoretical developments relevant to blood\ndynamics, but also for a systematic study of bloodstain formation\nand the application of current theories to model and hence\nunderstand the key characteristics of such stains. The work to be\ndescribed here aims to examine the stains formed following the\nimpact on paper of blood droplets in the millimetre size range and\ntravelling at a variety of angles and velocities. The spreading and\nsplash features are then interpreted following a review of\ntheoretical models and some conclusions drawn as to how such\nan understanding may beneﬁt the examination of bloodstains in\nthe forensic context.\n2. A review of the modelling of spreading and splash\nThe fundamental problem of explaining and predicting the\nspread of liquid following perpendicular impact on a smooth\nhorizontal surface has received much attention in the literature;\nfor example, see the review in Ref. [1]. The development of\nmathematical \nmodels \nhas \nprogressed \nalongside \nhigh \nspeed\nimaging experiments which reveal the mechanisms whereby the\nimpact of a spherical droplet leads to a circular, disc-shaped stain\n[2]. These show that the impact creates a lamella or boundary layer\nof liquid in contact with the surface which spreads rapidly in a\nradial direction while the majority of the droplet remains\nspherical. This stage is followed by the rim of the lamella swelling\nas liquid ﬂows outward from the spherical reserve to create a\nlargely-ﬂat, disc-like entity with a swollen rim. The material within\nthe rim may then recede inwards until equilibrium is attained. On\nsurfaces of low wettability this means that the diameter of the ﬁnal\nstain is likely to be less than that attained during the spreading\nphase. On the other hand, where there are surface-speciﬁc forces\nthat enhance wetting \nand are \nindependent of the \nimpact\nconditions, the ﬁnal stain diameter can be greater than that\ngenerated after the maximum spreading has occurred. Images of\nthese stages are given, for example, in Ref. [2].

The current\nliterature on theoretical models for the spreading and splashing of liquid drops on surfaces relevant to the\nforensic context of bloodstain formation has been reviewed. These models have been evaluated for a\npaper substrate using experimental data obtained as function of droplet size, impact velocity and angle. It\nis shown that for perpendicular impact there are fairly simple mathematical models for the spreading\ndiameter and the number of scallops or spines formed around the stain though these have quite limited\nranges of validity in their basic form. In particular, predictions for the diameter are best for small droplets\nimpacting at high velocity and the number of spines saturates for higher impact velocities. In the case of\nspreading, a modiﬁcation to the energy conservation model is found to provide excellent agreement with\nexperimental stain diameters across a wide range of impact velocities. For non-perpendicular impact, the\nwidth of stains is found to depend principally on the normal component of impact velocity and may be\npredicted by an appropriate modiﬁcation to the expression for the perpendicular case. Limitations in the\ncalculation of impact angle from the stain aspect ratio are identiﬁed and a theoretical basis for the\nprediction of spines around an elliptical stain is proposed. Some key issues for future research are\nidentiﬁed which include a systematic, quantitative study of the effect of surface properties on bloodstain\nformation.\n\u0002 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare.

Head of calves have been used [11], a human cadaver ﬁlled with blood [12], foams\nor sponges soaked in blood [4,13], or cavities ﬁlled with blood have been used [14]. Experiments\nreported here used both soaked foams and cavities ﬁlled with blood as the blood source, and the\ninformation on which blood source was used is speciﬁed.\n1. Data\nBlood spatters are a subset of bloodstain patterns, with stains generated when an impacting object\ncauses drops to go airborne [1–3] before hitting the surface of a solid object called the target. Gunshot\nbackspatters are spatters where blood is atomized by a bullet, in a direction opposite to that of the\nbullet [2]. Discussion and physical description on the dynamics of a ﬂuid impacted by a high-speed\nprojectile can be found in Ref. [15]. Those events of atomization and airborne transport are rarely\nobservable in a crime scene, and distinguish spatters from other bloodstain patterns, such as transfers\nwhere stains are produced by contact between the blood source and the target. Fig. 1 shows a typical\ngunshot blood spatter, as provided in this work.\nFig. 2 describes the geometry and setup used to generate the spatters. Most spatters were pro-\nduced on a vertical target, with the bullet hole indicating the bullet impact location. The travel\ndirection of the bullet was perpendicular to both the blood source and the target. For such a system,\nthe visible location of the bullet hole and the orientation of the image – the image width corre-\nsponding to the horizontal direction of the experiment – deﬁnes the geometry. For the cases where\nmuzzle gases were allowed to interact with the spatter process, the barrel of the gun was perpen-\ndicular to the cardstock target, and at the same distance from the blood source as the target, centered\ninto a cutout of about 1 in. in size. The cutout in the cardstock is also visible in the scans, and\ndetermines the geometry of the spatter. Few spatters were produced on horizontal targets, where the\nangle between the bullet trajectory and a horizontal line was varied between 0° and 60°.\nThe conditions of each experiment are documented in a text ﬁle located in the same directory as\nthe spatter image. For spatters on a vertical target, the conditions are summarized in Table 1, with the\nrange of each parameter, and the reason for documentation of each parameter. Fig. 3 provides a\nsynthetic view of the main variables investigated, the velocity of the impact that atomized the blood,\nand the distance between blood source and spatter target. For spatters on a vertical target, each test\nwas denoted using the nomenclature described in Fig. 3. For spatters on a horizontal target, each test\nwas denoted using the nomenclature in Table 2. The investigated conditions are summarized in\nTable 2. Some spatters names end with a number in parenthesis which our research team has used as\nan alternate name. Note that some spatters have been described in a general manner and compared\nto numerical models in Refs. [16,17].\nFig. 1. Example of blood spatter Rp42, with scale on top.

This conclusion has also been reached by other\nresearchers (Fig. 8) [13,63].\n2.3. Redox reaction mechanism\nWhile the identity of the emitter (3-aminophthalate) has\nbeen established for many years, the mechanism by which it is\nproduced in an excited state has been the subject of many postu-\nlated mechanisms [8,13,20,40,64–68]. A succinct description of\nthe current understanding of the probable reaction mechanism\naccounting for a number of ﬁndings from the aforementioned\nauthors was given by Barnett and Francis in their recent review\n[5]; based on this work and on the previous research especially\nby Mer´enyi and co-workers during the 1980s [20,64–68], the\ncurrently most accepted mechanism is presented in Fig. 9.\nLuminol in strongly alkaline solutions is deprotonated to the\nmonoanionic and the dianionic forms, with the former being\nprevalent between pH 8 and 14. The deprotonated luminol can\nbe oxidised, most likely by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin radical\n(OH-Fe4+-P•) and also by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin (OH-\nFe4+-P) to form radical intermediates, such as those described\nin the reaction with the true peroxidase enzymes, which can then\nreact to give an diazaquinone [20,68]. The diazaquinone can then\nundergo nucleophilic attack from the hydroperoxide ion deriv-\ning from the deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide (pKa 11.7)\n[20,39,40,47,68]. This is supported by the chemiluminescence\nintensity being dependant upon hydrogen peroxide concentra-\ntion, a factor which has been used analytically to determine this\nspecies [24,69]. An alternative path involving attack of super-\noxide (O2−) on the radical may also occur, especially under\nconditions where the radical is in low concentration [20].\nThe postulated mechanism following addition of peroxide\nto the diazaquinone (or superoxide to the radical) involves a\ncyclic addition of oxygen from the added hydroperoxide to the\nothercarbonylcarbonformingacyclicanti-aromaticendoperox-\nide whose bonds are particularly weak. The signiﬁcant amount\nof readily available energy contained in this species is then\ngained by cleavage and subsequent reorganisation of these\nbonds. Since nitrogen is an excellent leaving group because of\nthe relevant strength of its own bonds (and as a gas, it is also\nentropically favoured), the formation of the dicarboxylate anion\nby expelling nitrogen gas is favoured. The 3-aminophthalate\ndianion so formed is in an electronically excited triplet state (3-\nAPA*) (two unpaired electrons of the same spin) [8]. This then\nundergoes a slow spin-ﬂip process, to an excited singlet state\n(two unpaired electrons of different spin) which in turn decays\nto the ground state with the emission of light [38,40]. Evidence\nfor this pathway has been found by studies of diazaquinones\nwhich showed that these molecules give chemiluminescence on\nreactions with basic hydrogen peroxide without the need for\ncatalysts, the emitter being the 3-aminophthalate ion in an elec-\ntronically excited state (3-APA*) for the diazaquinone derived\nfrom luminol, with similar species being observed in the case of\nrelated diazaquinones [68].\nLight emission is almost instantaneous when luminol is\nsprayed on hematin, while with blood there can be a build-up\nFig. 8.

Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using\nlarger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can\nobscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).\nBlood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nLaan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can\nhelp pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).\nThe splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical\nS-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in\nFigure 8.\n5.

Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

    "text_chunk": "2.2.7. Feature selection and cross validation\nFeature selection is deﬁned as a set of algorithms that outputs a\nsubset of features based on the input feature set. The aim of feature\nselection is to determine those features that perform well under\nthe conditions imposed by a certain classiﬁcation system [37–39]\nor to eliminate redundant features [40]. Identifying the ideal\nfeature set can be particularly important when there is a large\nnumber of features to select from (e.g. in text classiﬁcation [15,41]).\nIn this study, sequential backward feature selection (BFS) and\nsequential forward feature selection (FFS) were performed on the\ntraining dataset. With these methods, a sequential search algorithm\neither adds features (FFS) or removes features (BFS) from a\ncandidate subset, while a criterion function7 is evaluated by the\nsearch algorithm in order to determine which combination of\nfeatures best discriminates the classes [42]. 5-fold cross valida-\ntion8\nwas simultaneously performed with feature selection\nproducing estimates of the expected classiﬁcation error given\ndifferent combinations of features. In this study, the cross\nvalidation error rates resulting from BFS and FFS were evaluated\nand compared using three different criteria (sum of the estimated\nMahalanobis distance9, inter-intra distance10 and 1-nearest-neigh-\nbour11). The sequential search algorithm and corresponding\ncriterion function producing the lowest error rate were eventually\nused to identify the combination of features optimal for the\nbloodstain pattern classiﬁcation task.\n2.2.8. Building the classiﬁer\n2.2.8.1. Linear discriminant analysis. \nThis study was based on the\nassumption that pattern classes can be distinguished by a\ncombination of distinctive properties. This led to the application\nof a Fisher mapping [44] (also known as Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis; \nLDA) \nwhich \nassumes \nthat \nclasses \nare \nnormally\ndistributed, and can be linearly separated by projecting all data\nonto a linear discriminant subspace12. The aim of LDA is to deﬁne\nan orthogonal projection to a line that maximises the distance\nbetween the mean of each class while minimising the variance of\neach class. In this way, such a projection leads to compact and well-\nseparated classes. LDA has been shown to be valuable in face\nrecognition applications [45,46] as it achieves a greater between-\nclass scatter when there are several classes, thereby simplifying\nclassiﬁcation [45]. Using such a method to increase the separation\nbetween classes is of value to BPA because bloodstain patterns can\nexhibit properties that are common to one or more classes.\n2.2.8.2. Quadratic discriminant classiﬁer. \nA quadratic discriminant\nclassiﬁer (QDC) formed the basis of the bloodstain pattern\nrecognition system. A QDC assumes that each pattern class\nfollows \na \nnormal \ndistribution \nand \nestablishes \na \ndecision\nboundary that maximises the Mahalanobis distance between\neach class mean. Classiﬁcation is thus performed by measuring the\nMahalanobis distance of an input pattern to the mean of each class\n[47]. The input pattern is then assigned a class label based on the\nshortest Mahalanobis distance to a particular class mean. In order\nto implement this classiﬁer, the Fisher mapping and QDC classiﬁer\nwere combined and trained together with the training dataset.\nFollowing this, the trained Fisher QDC was tested with the test\ndataset. The original class labels were obtained for both training\nand test datasets and compared with the predicted class labels\nproduced for each dataset. The estimated classiﬁcation error of the\nFisher QDC classiﬁer is reported where relevant.\n2.2.8.3. \nEvaluation \nof \nclassiﬁer \nperformance. \nThe Fisher QDC\nclassiﬁer was ﬁnally trained on the entire reference pattern dataset\n(i.e.atotal of 60patterns)resultingin afullytrainedFisherQDC (herein\nreferredtoasthetrainedclassiﬁer).

Example of a stitched impact spatter pattern (left) and a stitched cast-off pattern (right) from the reference pattern dataset. Green circular markers act as landmarks for\nstitching. Adhesive scale rulers surround the outer extremities of each pattern.\n7 A criterion function J(X) evaluates the goodness of a subset of features based on\nthe ability of a classiﬁer to discriminate the classes in the feature space represented\nby this feature set. A larger value of J indicates a better feature subset [42].\n8 Cross validation functions by randomly splitting the training dataset into ﬁve\nfolds, and then repeatedly testing the performance of the prospective classiﬁer on\neach fold when trained on the data in the other four folds [43].\n9 The sum of the estimated Mahalanobis distance criterion function is the sum of\nthe distance between a set of points and a distribution.

This resulted in the\naverage upper angles of the close-to-cone domain in which\ndroplets are issued for the forward and backward spatter of 27 \u0001 9\u0003\nand 57 \u0001 7\u0003, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-\ncone domain are 28 \u0001 12\u0003 and 30 \u0001 18\u0003, respectively. The detailed\ninformation on these angles is given in Fig. 7, with the lower semi-\nangles shown as negative.\nFig. 7 shows that backward spattered droplets have a wider\nspread angle than the forward spattered ones. The bare sponge\nexperiments 7Aa1 and 7Ab1 revealed an almost symmetric upper\nand lower angles of the spatter domains in forward and backward\nspatter. Such symmetry is less prominent in the other experiments\nwhich indicates that covering a sponge with silicone or tape results\nin an uneven distribution of droplets. This is important because\nthe initial droplet cloud signiﬁcantly determines their further\ntrajectories and shows that the effect of victim’s clothes may be\ncrucial for crime scene reconstruction. It should be emphasized\nthat blood droplets were seen to form from the target periphery\nnot penetrated by the bullet and continued to be formed long after\nthe bullet left the target. The above-mentioned angles correspond\nto 0.5 ms after the bullet impact. However, they vary in time, albeit\nnot too much, i.e. staying close to the values shown in Fig. 7.\nThe effect of muzzle gases on the blood spattered droplets is\nmore pronounced in experiments where the distance between the\nmuzzle of the gun and target was short. An example of this is\nshown \nin \na \nhigh-speed \nvideo \nnot \nanalyzed \nabove, \nwhose\nexperiment number was 7Aa7 which was a .22 cal bullet impacting\na blood-impregnated sponge at 50 cm. Several frames of this video\nare shown in Fig. 8.\nWhile the motion of the muzzle gases is difﬁcult to discern in\nthe still images, it is clearly visible in the video. The effect of the\nmuzzle gases is the following: as time progresses, the droplets do\nnot only move outward from the surface of the sponge, but are also\nentrained by muzzle gases impinging onto the sponge and turn\ntowards the left, which is against gravity and against backward\nspatter motion. This phenomena has been discussed in literature\nbefore [29], and clearly should not be ignored.\nTwo more observations worth noting were made when viewing\nthe selection of MFRC videos. Both of them are revealed in the\nforward spattered section of experiment 7Db2, of which a series of\nfour video frames are shown in Fig. 9.\nFirst, note that the angle of the bullet coming out of the target is\nnot normal to the target face. The forward spattered droplets seem\nto follow the axis of penetration and as a result, they travel at a\ndownward angle of inclination. Note that this trend is opposite to\nwhat is seen for backward spattered droplets in Fig. 8. For that\nFig. 5. The number of droplets in the PIV region of interest for each experiment.

How­\never, these density measurements appear to be lower than expected for \nexpirated and impact and this is likely to be due to the area of the convex \nhull of the pattern being measured larger than it truly is due to false \npositives near the edges of the target. As such it is likely that the density \nmeasurements for expirated and impact in particular are lower than the \ntrue values.\nThe convergence box calculated for cast-off 103 was much larger \nthan for the other two patterns reflecting the fact that cast-off patterns \nare not expected to have an area of convergence because the source of \nthe blood is not stationary. Fig. 9 shows the convergence heat maps for \nimpact 14 and expirated 9, and the centre of these heat maps accurately \nrepresent the differing positions of the blood source when these patterns \nwere created (close to the bottom of the target for impact and centrally \nfor expirated). For some cast-off patterns with limited stain numbers the \nconvergence was unable to be computed as there were no intersecting \ndirectional lines.\nThe convergence metric was the longest pattern metric to calculate \nparticularly for patterns with many stains as this created many in­\ntersections between the different stains directional paths which had to \nbe identified and counted.\n5. Conclusions\nOur main goal was to increase the objectivity of BPA by developing a \nmethod that could be used to extract quantitative data, including BPA \nspecific metrics, quickly and reliably from digital images of spatter \nbloodstain patterns.\nThe developed ABPA method described in this paper is an \nimprovement on methodologies described in prior research relating to \nquantitative BPA. We have demonstrated that the proposed ABPA \nmethod has a reliable and sensitive stain segmentation methodology \nthat copes well with shadows and uneven lighting, as well as different \nstain intensities, and is an improvement on both ImageJ and the previ­\nously reported Matlab developed method [18]. More stains and less \nbackground noise and/or false positives were identified with the pro­\nposed ABPA method compared to the previously described methodolo­\ngies. However, some false positives such as staple holes or marks from \nrulers were still identified as stains.\nWith regards to the BPA specific metrics, a novel approach to \nignoring tails and fitting ellipses was established resulting in accurate \nellipse fitting and therefore accurate impact angle calculations for the \nelliptical stains. A reliable approach to determining the location of the \ntail or spines on the stains and therefore their directionality was also \ndeveloped. Using the directionality and the orientation angle, the BPA \nspecific gamma angle was calculated for all stains with a circularity \nbelow 0.86. However, there were some challenges with irregular shaped \nstains (such as compound stains and flows) and the method struggled to \nfit accurate ellipses to these stains. Implementing a methodology to \nidentify overlapping ellipses would improve the outputs of the ABPA \nTable 4 \nPattern metrics for 3 different patterns.\nImpact 14\nCast-off 103\nExpirated 9\nLinearity - \nPolyline fit\n2.82e−05 x^2–0.194 \nx + 1.122e+04\n0.0006217 \nx^2–0.5498 x +\n4378\n3.512e−05 \nx^2–0.2742 x +\n3425\nR^2\n0.0022\n0.1084\n0.0017\nDistribution - \nratio stain \nnumber to \nconvex hull \narea\n3.87E−05\n1.01E−06\n1.92E−04\nratio stain area \nto convex \nhull area\n4.49E−03\n3.08E−04\n1.25E−02\nConvergence - \npoint of \nhighest \ndensity\n(3124.0, 12098.0)\n(1085.7, \n4797.2)\n(3564.0, 2915.0)\nbox of %60 of \nintersections\nlower left (x,y): \n(2556.1,11572.1) \nWidth: 3691.9 \nHeight: 1051.9\nlower left (x,y): \n(771.6,1884.5) \nWidth: 628.2 \nHeight: 3883.6\nlower left (x,y): \n(2970.0,1855.0) \nWidth: 594.0 \nHeight: 1590.0\nFig. 9.

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

Panel a taken with permission from\nDriscoll & Nagel (2011). Fingering edge breakup obtained by direct numerical simulation. Panel b taken with permission from Yokoi\n(2011).\nMotivated by the lotus leaf, superhydrophobic surfaces (i.e., hydrophobic and microstructured)\nhave been engineered using various pillar arrangements to make an impacting fakir drop bounce\nwith a restitution coefﬁcient as high as 0.9 (Richard & Qu´er´e 2000). In early studies, Reyssat et al.\n(2006) and Bartolo et al. (2006a) systematically varied the pillar height h and spacing ℓto ﬁnd the\ncritical impact velocity V ∗between the drop fully bouncing or partly wetting the surface (i.e., tran-\nsitions from full to partial repellency). This transition occurs when the impact energy is sufﬁcient\nto stretch the curved free meniscus between the pillars until they touch the substrate, giving\nV ∗=\n\t\nδh /ρℓ2.\nHowever, for even the most repellent surfaces at sufﬁciently high impact velocities, the spread-\ning edge of the lamella will break up, and only part of the drop can rebound. van der Veen et al.\n(2014) used color interferometry to measure the shape of the meniscus between such pillars. Most\nrecently, Antonini et al. (2014) applied X-rays to directly image the meniscus to pin down this\nwetting transition. Recent mushroom-shaped, double-reentrant, superomniphobic surfaces show\nbouncing of fully wettable liquids, such as hexadecane (Tuteja et al. 2008) and even perﬂuorohex-\nane (Liu & Kim 2014).\nRichard et al. (2002) demonstrated that the contact time of a drop impacting a smooth hy-\ndrophobic surface is almost constant, independent of the impact velocity, but grows linearly with\ndrop size. Bird et al. (2013) showed that this time can be reduced by a cleverly constructed pattern-\ning of a superhydrophobic surface, which breaks the drop into smaller pieces. They suggested that\nsome leaves and butterﬂy wings have developed such patterns. Moevius et al. (2014) demonstrated\nwhat they call a pancake rebound (Figure 9b). This occurs when the impacting drop spreads along\nthe texture but subsequently rebounds away from it before it can retract, thus retaining the ﬂat-\ntened shape when the liquid leaves the surface. This has the possible advantage of further reducing\nthe contact time of the drop with the substrate, which can be important in certain applications,\nsuch as anti-icing coatings. Coatings are also used to reduce bug-splatter remnants on windshields\nand airplane wings, on which impacts are usually at an angle (Yeong et al. 2014).\nThe next level of surface complexity involves modiﬁcations to promote directional rebounding,\nsuch as splitting the liquid into patterns or segmenting it onto wettable strips. Lee et al. (2010)\nstudied impacts on a wettability-patterned surface, consisting of hydrophobized radial spikes,\nemanating from the center of the impact location (Figure 9c). They successfully formed ﬁne\nradial ﬁngers at wavelengths different from the natural instability. Surprisingly, regular liquid\npatterns can be formed for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic line patterns, with the liquid resting\non and in between the patterns, respectively. Reyssat et al.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

    "text_chunk": "Taking the values for a and b for aluminum mirror as the base,\nand b = 3, a 10% change in a (keeping b constant) leads to about a\n51% change in h, whilst, a 10% change in b (keeping a constant)\nleads to about a 43% change in h. Conversely, to ensure that a\nchange in h does not exceed 10% (i.e. Dh/h < 10%), the maximum\nchange in a and b should not exceed approximately 2 and 3%,\nrespectively. Relating these observations to the correlations for\ndifferent targets in Table 3, the variations in a (between 2 and\n116%) and b (between 1.5 and 33%) exceed the above calculated\nvalues, thereby indicating that a single correlation will signiﬁcant-\nly impact the prediction of a drop release height.\nThe effects of this ﬁnding can be shown from the current set of\nexperiments, in Fig. 6. Here, we use the measured spread factor b\nfrom drop impact experiments on the aluminum mirror target\n(from all drop release heights), and calculate the drop release height\nusing the spreading correlations of Table 3 speciﬁc to each of the\ntargets. For the case with gravity and without drag, equation (16) is\nused to reconstruct the trajectory. For the case with gravity and\ndrag, the differential equations of motion in [6] are numerically\nintegrated. Hence, the height ratio HR compares the calculated\nheights using correlations of the individual targets (x-axis), to the\nexperimental drop release height on the aluminum mirror. It is\nimportant to mention here that the data in Fig. 6 corresponds to all\nthe drop release heights used in the experiments (i.e. 5, 10, 20,\n60 and 150 cm). Fig. 6 clearly shows a marked difference in height\npredictions from the respective correlations; the variation in the\naverage height values are tabulated in Table 4. For example,\nestimating the height of release of stains found on an aluminim\nmirror target using correlations obtained on glass would underes-\ntimate the release height by about 50%, while using correlations for\nrough polycarbonate would overestimate the height by about 50%.\nA related question of interest is the inﬂuence of the assumed\nhematocrit level on the backward reconstruction of trajectories.\nThis corresponds to a crime scene reconstruction where a standard\nhematocrit level, say 44%, would be used to estimate the height of a\nreleased drop, instead of measuring the hematocrit of the individual\nto whom the blood belongs. For the case where gravity is considered\nand drag neglected, the resulting uncertainty on the prediction of\nthe release height of a dripping drop can be estimated again by\nanalyzing how equation (16) depends on the hematocrit. First, the\nviscosity m of the blood depends on the blood hematocrit, as per\nequation (5). Second, the drop impact diameter di is not known on a\ncrime scene, contrary to the laboratory experiments here where it\ncan be measured from high-speed videos. In a crime scene situation,\nit has been proposed to estimate di by e.g. by measuring the volume\nVs of solid material remaining in the stain [6], which is linearly\nproportional to the drop volume and the hematocrit [9], so that\nVd = aVs/H, where a is a proportionality coefﬁcient determined\nexperimentally. For the present experiments, where average drop\nvolume of 7.89 mL and the average value of H = 44% is known, we\nhave aVS = 3.47 mL. As a result, the estimated impacting drop\ndiameter (di), for an unknown value of H can be obtained as:\ndi ¼\n6aVS\npH\n\u0002\n\u00031\n3\n:\n(19)\nTherefore, using standard values of hematocrit in trajectory\nreconstruction introduces two systematic errors, one on the blood\nviscosity and the other on the estimated impact diameter. An\nexample of the systematic error due to the use of standard values of\nhematocrit for the estimation of the dripping drop release height is\nshown in Fig. 7 for the situation when a dripping drop impacts an\naluminum mirror surface (i.e. a = 0.4285 and b = 0.1934), with\ntypical spreading b = 3 and 3.9. The droplet release height was\nestimated with and without considering the drag force acting on\nthe droplet, as was done for Fig. 6. For a typical hematocrit value of\n44%, the estimated droplet release heights are 26.0 cm without\ndrag and 28.1 cm with drag for the spreading factor b = 3. For the\nspreading factor b = 3.9, the estimated droplet release heights are\n100.8 cm without drag and 129.8 cm with drag.\nThe range of height over which the above graph is plotted\ncorresponds to the typical values of hematocrit found in humans. It\nis seen that within this range, and for this speciﬁc trajectory\nreconstruction task, a difference of 10% between the hematocrit\nused to develop the correlations, and that relevant to the crime\nscene (for instance 40% vs. 50%) leads to errors larger than 30% in the\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6.

Introduction\nThe emission of light observed when a solution containing\nluminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazine-dione or, more\nsimply, 3-aminophthalhydrazide) and hydrogen peroxide is\nsprayed on dried bloodstains has been utilised by forensic sci-\nentists in investigations involving violent crime for more than\n40 years. This article reviews the current understanding of the\nchemistry and mechanism of the luminol reaction as it pertains to\nthe detection of bloodstains. A forensic overview of operational\nuse of the luminol reaction will be given including a discus-\nsion of interfering species and the possible detrimental effect of\nluminol on further presumptive tests for blood and DNA typing\nanalyses.\n1.1. Chemiluminescence\nChemiluminescence [1] refers to the emission of light from\na chemical reaction, which can occur in solid, liquid or gas\nsystems. The fundamentals of chemiluminescence have been\ncomprehensively reviewed in a number of textbooks and articles\nin recent years [2–5].\nTwo main categories of chemiluminescent reaction have been\ndescribed in the literature, direct and indirect. Direct chemilu-\nminescence can be represented by:\nA + B →[I]∗→PRODUCTS + LIGHT\nwhere A and B are reactants and [I]* is an excited state inter-\nmediate. The luminol reaction is an example of this form of\nchemiluminescence. In certain cases where the excited state is\nan inefﬁcient emitter, its energy may be passed on to another\nspecies (a sensitizer, F) for light emission to be observed. This\nis called “indirect chemiluminescence” and is exempliﬁed by\nthe peroxyoxalate (light stick) reaction:\nA + B →[I]∗+ F →[F]∗→F + LIGHT\nOnce a molecule has been converted to a metastable interme-\ndiate in an excited state there are a number of routes by which\nit can return to the ground state. These routes can be displayed\ndiagrammatically, as in Fig. 1, by an “energy well” diagram, or\nmore simply by the Jablonski diagram, ﬁrst introduced in the\n1930s. The light emission can either be ﬂuorescence or chemi-\nluminescence, if from a singlet state, or phosphorescence if from\na triplet state.\nThe light emitted from chemiluminescent reactions has dif-\nfering degrees of intensity, lifetime and wavelength with the\nlatter parameter covering the spectrum from near ultraviolet,\nthrough the visible and into the near infrared.\nFor emission to be observed from a chemical reaction, three\nessential energetic requirements need to be met:\n1. There should be an energetically favourable reaction path-\nway for the production of the excited state species. Of the\ntotal number of molecules participating in the reaction a\nsigniﬁcant number should reach the excited state.\n2. Thereactionisrequiredtobeexothermic,withthefreeenergy\nchange being in the range 170–300 kJ mol−1.\n3. Thereshouldbeafavourabledeactivationpathwayforchemi-\nluminescence emission, with other competitive non-radiative\nprocesses such as intra- or intermolecular energy transfer,\nmolecular dissociation, isomerization or physical quenching\nkept to a minimum.\nThe intensity of the chemiluminescence emission from a\nreaction is dependant upon the rate of reaction and the efﬁciency\nof the process generating excited state species. The latter can\nbe described by the chemiluminescence quantum yield, ΦCL,\nwhich is deﬁned as:\nΦCL = total number of photons emitted\nnumber of molecules reacting\nFig. 1.

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009). This is particularly the case when\n372\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Impact events typically produce an array of\nliquid sheets and ligaments and other amorphous shaped volumes of\nliquid, many of which eventually equilibrate into spherical drops.\nDepending on their progress towards equilibrium, these volumes of\nliquid can form irregularly-shaped elements. Furthermore, because\ndrops can arrive at the target surface over a period of time, there is the\npotential for one drop to land on another, causing micro-splashing and\ntheformationofanelementwithalessregularmargin.Theproduction\nof cast-off drops is typically more uniform with drops forming at\nregular intervals from the break-up of ligament strands.

RBCs accumulate at the edge of the drop. When\nthe desiccation phenomenon occurs on the glass substrate, a decrease in volume is\nobserved due to the large amount of water required. During the desiccation process,\nstress inside the solid deposit of desiccated blood built up and induced surface cracks\nperiodically releasing the stress. Furthermore, the RBCs present at their surface\nproteins induce a hydrophobic behaviour with all materials. This is observed with\nglass. The dried RBCs at this position in the drop do not wet the substrate and\nreveal an hydrophobic behaviour. This enables a cracking phenomenon linked with\nthe diameter of the drop, and consequently with the perimeter of the corona. For\nsmall drop perimeters, the stress inside the RBCs solid deposit is small compared\nwith large drop diameters.\n5. Concluding remarks\nObservations of the Marangoni ﬂow motion inside a drop of blood using a digital\ncamera at a good resolution (about 2.3 µm) enable us to show that the motion of\nRBCs at the edge of the drop is the main mechanism of blood drop evaporation and\ndeposition. The mechanisms involved in the blood drop evaporation are conﬁrmed\nthrough the evaporation mass ﬂux which is measured to be in agreement with a\npure water drop evaporation. Other biological elements (white blood cells, proteins)\nare transported to the edge of the drop with the RBCs and contribute to the\npattern formation through the deposit wettability with the substrate and mechanical\nproperties. The blood evaporation dynamic can be predicted by a comparison with\nthe pure ﬂuid evaporation case corrected by the mass concentration in colloids.\nTotally diﬀerent patterns are formed according to whether the person is healthy or\nsuﬀers from anaemia or hyperlipidaemia. This is leading our research to correlate the\npattern formation with blood diseases.

The number of spots in each run, thus\nranked for sound level, is given in Fig. 4.\n3.2. Mouthing sounds and words in the upright seated posture\nthrough a bloody mouth\nThe number of spots of blood captured on the target for each\nrun is shown in Table 1. On average, each ‘P’ produced 271\ncaptured spots of which 2 were more than 1 mm dia.; each ‘S’\nproduced 313 captured spots of which 4 were more than 1 mm dia.\nFor the 10 ‘P’ runs, a total of 2060 spots were recorded including 16\nlarge spots – that is 1 large spot per 128 small spots. For the ‘S’ runs,\nthere were 43 large spots in a total of 3196 – that is 1 large spot per\n73 small spots.\nNote that the quiet ‘P’ sounds, used in the experiments with\nblood, were associated with rapidly developed peak pressures\n(Fig. 5) of less than 15 mm Hg; moderate sounds involved peak\npressures of around 25 mm Hg and the loudest ones were\nassociated with peak pressures of less than 35 mm Hg. In all cases\nthe manoeuvre was effectively impulsive, lasting for approx. 1 s,\nand pressure fell rapidly at the end.\nThe pressure recordings for an ‘S’ were of a different shape\n(Fig. 6), with an initial rapid rise to the peak value followed by a\nprogressive fall through the remainder of the manoeuvre as the\nsound was released and sustained.

This was owing to the amount of time it\nwould take to fully wet the high linear density yarns of the medium\nand heavy calico as the blood was only soaking through from the\ntechnical face of the fabric. When investigating spatter bloodstains\non three 100% cotton knitted fabrics with different yarn linear\ndensities, as with the current work on calico, it was found the\nsmallest bloodstains were on the fabric with the greatest yarn\nlinear density [28]. The greater the yarn linear density, the more air\nspaces there are between the ﬁbres, therefore the more blood\nwhich is required to fully wet the yarns, before wicking can occur.\nThe blood remaining on the surface of the fabric would dry before\nmuch wicking along the yarns was able to occur. 1.7 ms\u00011 is the\nonly velocity where the heavy calico specimens had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area (Fig. 3). As the predominant method by\nwhich the bloodstains are being created on the medium and heavy\ncalico at this velocity is wicking vertically into the fabric under\ngravity, the greater yarn linear density of the heavy than either the\nmedium or light calico would reduce the ability of the blood to\nwick into the heavy calico.\nOn all three fabrics for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts the blood which\nremained on the surface of the fabric dried in the manner of the\ncoffee ring effect (Fig. 8a–c, marked ‘B’) [29,30]. The coffee ring\neffect occurs in many colloidal ﬂuids when the solutes move to the\npinned edge of the liquid drop to compensate for evaporative\nlosses [31]. This results in a higher concentration of particulates at\nthe edge of the drop than the centre, and is evidenced by a ring of\ndense blood surrounding the parent bloodstain.\nAs a larger volume of blood remained on the surface of the\nmedium and heavy calicos than the light calico, the coffee ring\neffect was more pronounced. The coffee ring effect occurred more\nextensively for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts as blood pooled on the surface of\nall fabrics following impact and dried before wicking occurred.\nFig. 2.

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4.

They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

It was the aim of this research to\ndetermine the potential maximum distance blood droplets travel horizontally following a vertical impact\ninto liquid blood. A custom apparatus was designed and constructed to replicate a vertical impact of a\ntimber weapon, rotating on a ﬁxed axis at one end, striking a pool of liquid blood. The device was\npositioned at three different levels of elevation to replicate an impact to the head of a person near ground\nlevel, a seated or kneeling height and standing height. Overall, the results indicated that the application of\nkinetic energy of between 1 and 5 J at a height of 1780 mm led to the blood droplets travelling a maximum\nhorizontal distance of 5361 mm (and average maximum distance of 4981 mm). The horizontal distance\nblood droplets may travel upon impact does not appear to follow a linear trend with differing kinetic\nenergy, but is affected by the applied force and release height in a curvilinear relationship.

Bloodstains can\nassist us in indicating who was involved in an assault via DNA\nproﬁling, however bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) may assist in\ndetermining where and how the blood shedding event occurred.\nWith a high proportion of physical assaults that result in death\ncoming from blunt force injuries [1], the physical characteristics of\nbloodstains can be powerful evidence. Bevel and Gardner [2] state\nthat “bloodstain pattern analysis is based on a very simple theory:\nblood as a ﬂuid will react to external forces in a predictable fashion”.\nThis theory sets the premise for BPA, in that the patterns are\nreproducible under similar physical conditions [3] and as such the\nphysical characteristics of the bloodstain patterns can reﬂect the\nnature of events that produced them.\nThe analysis of the size, shape, location, and distribution of\nbloodstains can assist with information on how they were\ndeposited [4] and BPA often plays a role in supporting or refuting\nstatements of the victim, suspect or witness [3]. For example,\ndetermining the volume and impact velocity of small bloodstains\nmay assist determining the position of where they originated [5],\npotentially providing information about whether the blood\nstaining on a suspect’s clothing could have been deposited as a\nresult of rendering ﬁrst aid [6] or being a bystander. In recent times\nthe reliability of BPA methodology has been heavily scrutinised by\nthe courts and the scientiﬁc community. The National Research\nCouncil report in 2009 [7] included the suggestion that an\nunderstanding of the physics of ﬂuid transfer was required for\nbloodstain pattern interpretation and reconstruction and that the\n“uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are\nenormous”. The fundamentals of ﬂuid dynamics relating to BPA\nhave been explored and certain aspects identiﬁed as requiring\nfurther work to increase the understanding in this ﬁeld have been\nidentiﬁed [8,9]. Subsequently, there has been a signiﬁcant increase\nin BPA research to explore the accuracy and reliability including a\ncomparative review of ﬂuid dynamics and BPA [8] that highlight\nthe links between them.\nHistorically much of the research in BPA has focused on\ndetermining the area of origin, deﬁned as “the space in three\ndimensions to which the trajectories of spatter can be utilized to\n* Corresponding author at: Ofﬁce of the Chief Forensic Scientist, Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department, Macleod, Victoria 3085, Australia.\nE-mail address: christopher.ﬂight@police.vic.gov.au (C.

    "text_chunk": "mankind’s creativity. In the late 1800s, Worthington used short\nand intense electric sparks to impress his retina and ‘freeze’ the\nmotion of impacting water and mercury drops. Patching together\nseveral of these sketches taken at different instants of the impact,\nhe could sketch without camera a sequence of drawings of drops\ndeforming during impact, achieving a time resolution better than a\nmillisecond [53,54]. Current commercially available high-speed\ncameras can conveniently record continuous movies from events\nat frame rates up to 100,000 frames per second [55]. Using similar\nprinciples as Worthington, but faster ﬂashes and sensitive\ncameras, FD phenomena have been imaged in research laborato-\nries at frame rates up to one million frames per second [56].\nFemtosecond lasers provide even faster illumination, and frame\nrates up to one trillion frames per second are even possible [57], as\nlong as the investigated phenomena are reproducible at these\ntimescales.\nSeveral other non-intrusive experimental technologies are\napplicable to measure the dynamics of drop generation, ﬂight\nand impact, in terms of particle size, velocities, temperatures,\ncomposition and their distributions, as reviewed in [58–60]. The\ntechnologies include particle image velocimetry, laser-induced\nﬂuorescence and laser-Doppler methods.\nThe dynamics of drop generation is also well documented for\nthe following processes: dripping, sheet breakup and jet breakup.\nDripping occurs when a slowly growing volume of liquid\nsuspended by capillary forces is detached as a drop by gravity\nforces. Inertial and viscous forces typically play a secondary role\nbecause the process is slow. The debate [40,41] in the BPA\ncommunity about the existence of a typical or minimum volume of\na blood drop generated by dripping can be resolved as follows: this\nvolume depends on the balance between gravity and the vertical\nprojection of the capillary force, rather than simply on the balance\nbetween gravity and surface tension. While surface tension only\ndepends on the solid and the ﬂuids in contact, the vertical\nprojection of the capillary force depends also on the wetted\ndiameter and wetting angle (see Table 2), i.e. on the shape and\nmaterial of the object from which the drop drips. Therefore,\ndripping drops with a wide range of volumes can be generated by\nchanging, for example, the diameter or material of a pipette, as\nalready mentioned in the French version of the early BPA work of\nBalthazard et al. [42].\nThe dripping phenomenon is well understood [61,62] in terms\nof kinematics [63], frequency, drop volume and ‘‘pinch-off length’’,\nwhich is the distance where a drop separates itself from its source.\nViscosity inﬂuences the dripping process of Newtonian [64] and\nnon-Newtonian ﬂuids [65]. If the ﬂow rate that causes the initial\nvolume of liquid becomes faster, inertial forces come into play (as\nindicated by non-negligible Weber numbers). Inertial effects affect\nthe drop size, the formation of smaller ‘‘satellite’’ drops [66]. At\neven faster ﬂow rates dripping transitions towards jetting, when\nthe Weber number reaches a critical value [67]. Also, dripping and\njet breakup induce longitudinal oscillations in the generated drops\n[68,69]. The frequency of these oscillations is controlled by surface\ntension and the mass of the drop [70], and viscous forces tend to\ndissipate these oscillations.\nSheet breakup: In several situations relevant to BPA, the blood\nspatter originates from a liquid sheet that subsequently experi-\nences several topological changes until it breaks into drops.\nComplex instability mechanisms drive these topology changes,\nfrom sheet to jets, and from jets to drops as shown in Fig. 6. These\ntopology changes are important, because they indicate that there is\nno such thing as a single ‘‘point’’ of origin of a blood spatter. Sheet\nbreakup has been studied in relation to commercial nozzle and\nspray generation processes, as reviewed by Lefebvre [71], and also\nin relation to its occurrence during drop impact (see Section 5.2\nand [72]). The breakup of a sheet involves a cascade of events, such\nas (1) the thickening of the forward edge of the sheet into a\ncylindrical rim, due to the tendency of interfaces to assume a\nspatially-uniform curvature, forming either plain cylinders or\nspherical drops; (2) transverse instabilities on the rim, leading to\ncusps and ﬁnger-like jets; and (3) longitudinal instabilities along\nthe rim, such as the Rayleigh-Plateau [24] instability that break the\njets into drops, as in Fig. 6d.\nSheet breakup is more complex than dripping. The time for the\nsheet to breakup can be estimated using linear stability theory\n[76,77]. Also, experiments and ﬂuid dynamic models on atomiza-\ntion [78–80] relate the average size of drops to a power of a\ncharacteristic Weber number We = rV2L/s, where L is a represen-\ntative length scale of the initial conﬁguration, for example the\nthickness of the liquid sheet.\nJet breakup: The formation of drops from a liquid jet occurs by\nseveral instability mechanisms that break the jet into a train of\ndrops, as e.g. in Fig. 6d. These mechanisms are reviewed in [23,81].\nInstabilities are characterized by their driving and resisting forces,\ntheir temporal evolution (growth rate) and their spatial features\n(wavelength l). Understanding how instabilities grow helps to\ndetermine the time of breakup and the size distribution of the drops.\n4. Flight of drops\n4.1. Description in the BPA literature\nOne of the main issues in BPA is to determine where a blood\nspatter originates from, for the purpose of reconstructing the\nbloodletting event. This operation involves the backward recon-\nstruction of drop trajectories based on the inspection of the stains\nand on a model for the ﬂight of drops.\nFig. 5. Early attempts of visualizing drop impact. (A-B) show various shapes assumed by a drop of milk impacting on a glass target, as sketched in 1876 by Worthington,\nwithout a camera, but with the help of an electrical spark generator and of his retinal persistence. Hand-drawn sketches show ring accumulation during the impact, splashing\nand the formation of spines.

The initial trajectory was\ntangential to the disk.\nWhile in ﬂight the drops experienced shape oscillations due to\nthe unbalanced surface tension forces at the time of release. Most\nof the primary cast-off drops detached with a prolate spheroidal\nshape (with j1 \u0004 ARj0 < 0.2). They oscillated with moderate to\nsmall amplitude with the dimensionless drop distortion (y < 0.4\nand j1 \u0004 ARj \u0007 0.3) and damping rates within the range seen in\npassive dripping. This suggested that the initial oscillations of this\ntype of drops may be successfully modeled with the numerical\nscheme that performed well for the passive blood drops oscillation\nsimulation discussed above.\nThe size of the primary drops cast off from the disk decreased as\nthe rotational velocity increased. The ligament length, on the\ncontrary, increased with the speed of rotation. The longer\nligaments, consequently, produced higher numbers of smaller\ndiameter satellite drops.\nAs the relatively larger cast-off drops formed at lower velocities,\nand drops that possessed higher velocities were signiﬁcantly\nsmaller in size, the initial Weber numbers of the cast-off drops\nremained low (<3). Moreover, as each drop was formed it would\ndecelerate (and thus the We number of its ﬂight would decrease)\ndue to the combined action of air resistance and gravitational force.\nSuch low Weber numbers for cast-off drops (see Fig. 12) indicate\nlow deformation levels during ﬂight which are unlikely to\ninﬂuence the drop’s ﬂight path and/or velocity at the moment\nof impact on a surface.

The latter devices work by the action of high pressure on\nthe rear of the projectile acting to accelerate it, pushing it along the\ntube without signiﬁcant leakage of the propellant gas or air around\nthe sides of the projectile. The acceleration is continually high\nthroughout the length of the barrel, not diminishing signiﬁcantly\nas the projectile increases speed.\n4.4. The ﬂight characteristics of spherical drops ﬁred into still air\nA droplet or particle allowed to fall in still air will speed up from\nrest in its downward motion due to the force of gravity causing it to\naccelerate. However, as the droplet moves through the surround-\ning air, it will experience viscous drag forces acting to slow it down\nin the manner described by Stokes’ Law. Ultimately, it will reach a\nmathematically predictable constant vertical terminal settling\nvelocity when the drag and gravitational forces balance.\nVery small droplets (0.01 mm diameter, typical of a water\nfog)\nhave\nan\nexceedingly\nsmall\nterminal\nsettling\nvelocity\n(3 \u0003 10\u00023 m s\u00021). For progressively larger droplets of increasing\nmass to surface area ratio, the terminal velocity increases rapidly\nwith size. Droplets of 0.1 mm dia. (typical of a mist), whilst still\nstrongly dominated by the viscous effects of the air, have a settling\nvelocity of the order of 0.3 m s\u00021. 1.0 mm drops (small rain drops)\nhave a far higher settling velocity of around 30 m s\u00021; their\naerodynamic behaviour is somewhat different from the smaller\nones and they are less vulnerable to any environmental airﬂow\ndisturbances.\nThe ﬂight characteristics of spherical drops ﬁred impulsively\ninto still air, rather than simply dropped, also may be calculated\nusing well established mathematical ballistic descriptions of their\nbehaviour. The ﬂight behaviour of spherical, unit density, droplets\nof a range of size ﬁred into still air at an initial velocity of 5 m s\u00021 at\nangles of 08, 308 or 458 to the horizontal, assuming the viscous drag\nforce to be described by the classical Stokes’ Law are illustrated in\nFig. 10a and b. The initial trajectory of 458 was chosen as this is very\nclose to the ideal angle to achieve the maximum horizontal ﬂight\ndistance of a large drop; greater or lesser angles produce ﬂight\npaths of shorter range measured along the horizontal at the level of\nﬁring.\n1.0 mm dia. droplets follow a near parabolic trajectory (Fig. 10a)\nbecause their motion is dominated by the effects of gravity; they\ncan cover signiﬁcant horizontal ranges and also reach signiﬁcant\nheights. Their behaviour is near to that of the traditional cricket\nball ﬂight.\nDroplets less than approx. 0.5 mm dia. behave very differently\nfrom larger ones. Their ﬂight is progressively attenuated because of\nthe dominant viscous effects and they travel only very small\ndistances from the point of ejection. As these droplets reach the\nlimit of their forward motion, they settle out reaching their\nterminal velocity in due course. The horizontal distance reached by\n0.1 mm drops, when ﬁred at 5 m s\u00021, is around 10–12 cm whilst\nthe vertical travel is less than 8 cm (Fig. 10b). Furthermore,\napparently paradoxically, small droplets ﬁred upwards at 308\ntravel further horizontally than those at 458; this is because they\nare not being slowed down as much by drag due to their vertical\nmotion.\nThe level of drag exerted on a spherical particle with increasing\nvelocity appropriately scaled as the Reynolds number (Re) is very\nwell known (see for example Ref. [17]). Stokes’ Law adequately\ndeﬁnes the viscous drag on spherical drops or particles travelling at\nspeeds where the appropriate velocity scaling, or Re, is less than\napprox. 1. As Re increases, so the drag law changes through the\nintermediate region (for Re in the range of approx. 1–103) to\nNewton’s Law for Re in the range 103–105 and the drag is more\nthan would be expected on the basis of Stokes’ Law, with the\ndroplet being slowed down more quickly and in a shorter distance\nthan indicated in the trajectories in Fig. 10a. In the circumstances\nof present interest, drops may be travelling at speeds governed by\ndiffering laws at various stages of their ﬂight (thus, for 1.0 mm\ndrops projected at an initial velocity of 5 m s\u00021, the initial\nRe = \u0004350; at the same ejection speed, 0.1 mm drops would have\n[(Fig._9)TD$FIG]\nFig. 9.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013).

Introduction\nReconstruction of the events from autopsy and scene ﬁndings is\none essential objective in death investigations. The presence of\nbloodstains at the crime scene can be of major importance for the\ninvestigation and reconstruction. In addition to haemogenetic\nindividualisation, the morphology and distribution of bloodstain\npatterns can provide vital information on the character, number\nand chain of events, which have caused the bloody scene. Before\nsuch interpretation of bloodstain patterns can be carried out\nreliably, the expert must have built up knowledge of and\nexperience in the types of stains and distributions, which may\nbe caused by various forms of injuries and mechanisms. In addition\nto systematic studies [1–4,6,8,9,10,11,13–18,20,21,23,26], case\nreports [5,12,22,24,27,28] may signiﬁcantly contribute to the\nvalidation\nof\nbloodstain\npattern\nanalyses,\nespecially\nif\nthe\nreconstruction is conﬁrmed by witnesses or perpetrators. This is\nwhy a series of illustrative case examples involving various\nbloodstain distribution patterns is presented where the mechan-\nism of production was veriﬁed by a confession of the offender. The\ncases originated from the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of\nMu¨nster, Germany, where crime scenes are regularly investigated.\n2. Case reports\n2.1. Case 1: arterial blood spatters originating from a corpse?\nA 23-year-old man was found dead near his car in some woods.\nThe missing head had been severed at the level of the 6th cervical\nvertebra, which showed 3 deep notches. Signs of severe anaemia\nwere obvious in the trunk of the body, but only a few bloodstains\nwere found inside the boot of the car. A suspect, who was soon\narrested, led the police to the site in the wood where he had buried\nthe head, which showed 2 intracranial gunshot wounds from a 5.6-\nmm rimﬁre riﬂe. The suspect claimed that he had performed the\ndecapitation with an axe in an aviary, after the victim was dead.\nThe crime scene investigation in the aviary (3 m \u0002 3 m) (Fig. 1a)\ntook place 5 days after the killing. On the left side of the door, the\nlower part of the wire netting showed abundant tiny blood\ndeposits and a large diagonal smear stain directed downwards.\nBelow these stains and covered by some sand, the soil was soaked\nwith blood over an area measuring 80 cm \u0002 25 cm and up to 20 cm\ndeep. A wooden beam at the bottom of the wire netting also\nshowed extensive red–brown discolouration from blood.

Contrary to experimental work, case reports where the reconstruction has\nbeen veriﬁed have rarely been published. This is the reason why a series of four illustrative cases is\npresented where bloodstain pattern analysis at the crime scene made a reconstruction of the events\npossible and where this reconstruction was later veriﬁed by a confession of the offender. The cases\ninclude various types of bloodstains such as contact and smear stains, drop stains, arterial blood spatter\nand splash stains from both impact and cast-off pattern. Problems frequently encountered in practical\ncasework are addressed, such as unfavourable environmental conditions or combinations of different\nbloodstain patterns. It is also demonstrated that the analysis of bloodstain morphology can support\nindividualisation of stains by directing the selection of a limited number of stains from a complex pattern\nfor DNA analysis. The complexity of real situations suggests a step-by-step approach starting with a\ncomprehensive view of the overall picture. This is followed by a differentiation and analysis of single\nbloodstain patterns and a search for informative details. It is ideal when the expert inspecting the crime\nscene has also performed the autopsy, but he deﬁnitely must have detailed knowledge of the injuries of\nthe deceased/injured and of the possible mechanisms of production.\n\u0002 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

    "text_chunk": "ordinates between the centre of the stain and the furthest point away \nwere calculated with negative values indicating a left direction. For \nstains with left directionality, the gamma angle equates to the angle of \nthe stain plus 180 degrees.\nFor stains that are not particularly elliptical, determining a reliable \ndirectionality is difficult, if not impossible as tails and protrusions are \nusually not formed, and the leading edge of the stain cannot be identi­\nfied. Therefore, a threshold ratio of 0.86 was set (which equates to \napproximately 60-degree angle of impact) as stains made at impact \nangles above this do not usually display tails or protrusions. Thus, \ndirectionality was not calculated for stains which had a width to length \nratio greater than 0.86 to ensure only reliable directionality measure­\nments were calculated.\n3.5. Pattern metrics\nThree pattern metrics were selected for computation: linearity, \nconvergence and distribution of stains. The linearity was chosen as a \nmathematical representative of how linear or not a pattern was. It is \nexpected that patterns such as cast-off will have a more linear shape than \nradiating patterns from a stationary source of blood such as an impact, \nand therefore may be a useful measurement for discrimination. The \nlinearity was calculated by plotting all the stain centroids and fitting \nthem to a two-degree polynomial curve using numpy’s “polyfit” function \nwith an output graph [33].\nA small area of convergence in a pattern indicates that the stains \noriginated from a small area, suggesting a stationary source of blood, \nand is expected to be observed in impact patterns (and expirated pat­\nterns). To identify the area of convergence, a line following the major \naxis of the ellipse was extended back to the edge of the image for all \nstains with fitted ellipses. A sliding window algorithm over these line \nsegments found all of the intersections. A density matrix was calculated \nwith the Gaussian kernel density estimator described in [34] with 25 \nbins and then plotted using a heat map. A box was fitted around the area \nthat contained 60 % of the intersections and the co-ordinates of this box \nwere computed.\nA convex hull was applied to the entire pattern to calculate the total \narea of the pattern. The distribution of the stains was then calculated in \ntwo different ways, the first was simply the total number of stains \ndivided by the pattern area, and secondly, the total area of the stains \ndivided by the pattern area which gave a proportion of the pattern that \nwas stains.\n3.6. User interface\nA user interface was developed to increase usability of the applica­\ntion. This enables the user to select which annotations to display, which \npattern metrics to compute, and which results to export.\nThe user interface also enables the analyst to zoom in on a selected \nstain when the row representing that stain is selected, creating a link \nbetween the data and the selected stain. This allows the results to be \nchecked against the physical characteristics of the stain to ensure ac­\ncuracy. Batch processing was also made available so an entire folder of \nimages can be processed with no further user interaction.\n3.7. Outputs\nA digital image of a spatter pattern is used as the input along with the \nknown resolution of the image (in pixels per mm). The method delivers \nthe individual bloodstain metrics as a comma separated file (containing \none line for each stain and columns for each metric) and an annotated \nimage with selected features displayed. The overall pattern metrics are \ndelivered as a further comma separated file, and three graphs are pro­\nduced to display convergence, linearity and distribution of the stains. \nThe co-ordinates for all boundary pixels for each stains are also pro­\nduced in a separate comma separated file, with each row representing \nFig. 3.

Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using\nlarger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can\nobscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).\nBlood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nLaan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can\nhelp pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).\nThe splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical\nS-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in\nFigure 8.\n5.

The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &\nBourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or\nspatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Complexity will \nhence also encapsulate an inherent difficulty to transparently \nexplain and assess the process. As one reviewer aptly put \nit: “complexity is associated with the degree of uncertainty \none faces when assigning probabilities, so naturally, less data \nmore complexity.”\n2.\t The type of evaluative propositions\nApplications of LRs in the context of forensic expertise [20] \nare not only limited to evaluate the relation of the evidence \nwith either its source, but also to the associated activities, \nor the offense itself. These three types of propositions are \nwhat Cook et al. define as the hierarchy of propositions [35], \nexplaining that propositions of lower hierarchy (about source) \nare easier to weigh than higher ones (about activity or offense). \nThis hierarchy is reflected on the vertical axis of Figure 1.\nFor the first type of evaluative statement, source-­based evalua-\ntions, it is easier to apply LRs to material traces than patterns \n[36], because the material is of similar nature as the source \n(albeit in lower quantity), while patterns involve the printing of \nfeatures from the source to the evidentiary findings, a trans-\nfer process that is not always reproducible. As mentioned in \nRef. [37], “In case of crime scene markings created by one \nobject leaving markings of itself on another object—­such as \na fingerprint onto a surface, a firearm barrel onto a bullet, \nor teeth onto skin—­the faithfulness of the transfer from the \noriginal to the receiving surface, and the ability of the receiv-\ning surface to retain the impression unchanged, are essential \nto the probativeness of the comparison of the mark on the \nreceiving surface to a suspected source.”\nThe second type of evaluative statements where LRs are used \ninvolves activity propositions, where it is asked to consider \nthe meaning of the forensic observations in the context of \nthe activities that led to them. Evaluations of activity add to \nsource-­level considerations, the necessity to consider parameters \nsuch as the transfer and transport (how much material would \nbe exchanged under these alleged actions; how far from the \nsource would material be found), persistency over time (how \nthe material will potentially change, deteriorate, or disappear \nover time), the efficiency of the recovery methods used to \ncollect the traces, and the presence by chance of the material \nin the background [35]. Evaluations of activity do not only \naim at associating evidence to a source, but also, and often \nmainly, consider the spatial motion or temporal modification of \nthe evidentiary material. Examples are the assessment of DNA \nfindings considering either a direct or a secondary transfer \n[38] or the assessment of fibers [39] or glass [40] if a given \nset of actions occurred. Consideration of activity relies both \non databases of experimental cases and on models of the \ntransport, transfer, or persistence phenomena involved, be they \nphysical, chemical, or biological in nature. Again, the models \nneed to be validated against well-­designed and available data.\nThe third type of evaluations relates to judicial matters such as \nthe committed offense, which involve, in general, considerations \noutside the domain of expertise of the forensic expert [35].\nTherefore, Figure 1 represents the increasing difficulties associ-\nated with the different methods and propositions evaluated with \nLRs. The difficulties increase along the diagonal direction, from \nthe “less complex” to the “more complex” realm. Indeed, forensic \nevaluations become more complex with increasing level in the \nhierarchy of propositions, with the unavailability of methods, \nmodels, and data, and with increasing number of variables that \nmay contribute to the assignments of probabilities. To be clear, \nthe term “less complex” is not used to mean that any forensic \nevaluation is trivial, but it indicates that in some activities of \nforensic science, the methods of evaluation are established \nand well documented, while in others, practitioners have to \nresort on their personal experience through methods that are \nless documented in the peer-­reviewed literature.\nIn this commentary, we limit the discussion to the first two \ntypes of evaluative statements, to which LRs have been applied: \nsource-­based and activity-­based.\n3  |  WHAT ARE THE EVALUATIVE \nSTATEMENTS AND METHODS RELEVANT \nTO BPA?\nLet us consider now what type of evaluative statements are ex-\npected from BPA experts, and what methods are used to evaluate \nthese statements. To do so, we review, in Table 1, the goals and \nmethods of BPA and the forensic discipline that examines traces \nof blood for the purpose of crime scene reconstruction and court \nFI G U R E 1 The diagonal arrow shows that the complexity in \nassigning likelihood ratios increases with, on the vertical axis, the \nhierarchy of propositions (source, activity, and offense), and, on \nthe horizontal axis, the method/knowledge used to assign the \nassociated probabilities. The approximative core positions of a \nfew forensic disciplines are indicated.

Hematocrit for sheep\nblood ranges between 13 and 32% [23]. The arm was able to rotate\naround a ﬁxed axis, was drawn back with a bungee cord and\nreleased to produce the cast-off spatter. The swing motion was\nconstrained in a vertical plane and spatter stains were produced\nmostly on the front wall. The experiments involved pattern\ngeneration, identiﬁcation, bloodstain labeling and photographing,\nlaser scanning (here FARO Focus S350 with ranging error of \u00021 mm\nand angular accuracy of 19 arcseconds), with reference markers on\nthe wall. Data analysis in a computer aided design (CAD) program\n(FARO Zone 3D) was used to align stain photographs with a three-\ndimensional representation of the room. Results were displayed by\nimporting all data into 3ds Max [22]. The cast-off rig produced ﬁve\ntrials at 0.5 m and another ﬁve trials 1.0 m from the target surface\n[22]. The velocity of the cast-off producing end of the member after\nthe trials was approximately 10:5 \u0002 1:2  m\ns [22]. A detailed three-\ndimensional analysis of the experiments is available in [22].\nThe uncertainty on the weapon swing was estimated as a radius of\n2.7 cm.\n2.3. “Human”, non-circular cast-off spatter patterns\nSix cast-off patterns were generated by a human participant\nswinging a wooden rod in a non-circular trajectory representative\nof an actual ﬁght (“human” cast-offs #1–4, 6–7). The documenta-\ntion and measurements process of the stains was same as with the\nCastanova rig. In the experiments, the blood was previously\ndonated from volunteers, and spiked with anticoagulant. The blood\nwas heated to room temperature (approximately 23 \u0003C) prior to\nuse.\nThe motion of the weapon relative to the bloodstained surfaces\nwas measured and documented as follows. Eighteen accelerometer\nand gyroscope systems were used (MTw Awinda from Xsens [24]).\nThis motion capture system is a commercial motion capture\nsystem with six degrees of freedom (linear accelerations along (X,\nY, Z) coordinates axes and rotational accelerations along three\nperpendicular ðf; u; cÞ orientations). The motion capture system\ndetermines the (X, Y, Z) coordinate locations from the linear and\nrotational accelerations. The measurement setup allows for\neighteen body motion trackers placed at various areas on the\nbody and one additional tracker ﬁxed on the item being used as a\n“weapon”.\nThe weapon used for this study was a wooden rod with a length\nof 34 cm and a diameter of approximately 4 cm. A tracker was\nplaced on the rod, ﬁxed at a known position along the length of the\nrod at approximately 10 cm from the end held by the subject. To\nreconstruct the motion of the end of the rod, the tracker data is\ntranslated by the corresponding length and oriented. The motion\ncapture system requires that the person being recorded is\n“calibrated” in the system by entering their body dimensions\nand then by moving through a routine of prescribed motions that\naccurately calibrate each tracker to their respective position on the\nsubject.\nThe motion recording began with the right foot of the\nparticipant aligned onto a reference marker on the ground. The\nparticipant then wet the rod by dipping into a small bowl of blood.\nParticipants were directed to take a few steps towards the wall\ndirectly in front of them and then swing the rod with enough force\nto create a cast-off pattern. The motion started with the arm\nlowered, then raised up, then quickly downwards. Once the\nstriking motion was complete, the subject was asked to step back\nand reposition their right foot on the marker. The recording was\nthen ended. A total of six trials were recorded, all of which are used\nin this manuscript.\nIn addition to the motion capture system, a Microsoft Kinect\nsensor was used to record motion point cloud data of the subject\ncreating the cast-off pattern [25,26]. This was used as a redundant\nexternal system of a color CGA video camera in RGB and an infrared\nprojector with 640 \u0004 480 pixel resolution at 30 frames per second.\nThe system allowed for the walls, ﬂoor, and motion of the subject to\nbe captured in the global scale of the room. The motion capture\nsystem did not have any external references and thus, having the\nparticipant place their right foot on a known marker at the\nbeginning and end of each trial was used to accommodate for any\ndrift or other possible inaccuracies in the motion capture system.\nBased on the above setup, it was possible to align all the data such\nthat the motion of the rod was measured in relation to the rest of the\nroom during the generation of the cast-off pattern. The uncertainty\non the weapon swing was estimated as a radius of 5.4 cm.\nFig. 2.

Symbols da and dg are the\nuncertainty on the estimated direction of the respective impact velocity and\nof the main axis of the stain.

To provide evidence that the results in this manuscript extend\nto blood that can clot, the anticoagulant is deactivated following\nthe procedure outlined in Section 2.3 \nand the low impact\nexperiments are repeated with R = 2 mm and h = 10 cm on the ﬁve\nsurfaces (Fig. 11).\nThe ﬁnal dried bloodstains demonstrated that the presence of\nthese coatings noticeably reduced the size of the bloodstain\nrelative to the clean glass regardless of whether the blood was able\nto clot. Given that the high-speed images indicate that most of the\nstain reduction occurs within a fraction of a second upon impact, it\nis not particularly surprising that clotting—which typically is\nassociated with longer time periods—has a negligible effect.\nNevertheless, there are some aspects of the bloodstains that differ\nbetween the activated and deactivated anticoagulant experiments\nthat warrant closer inspection. In particular, the stain on the\nﬁngerprint-coated glass appeared to undergo a sudden retraction\non the hour time-scale (Fig. 6). One might think that clotting might\nprevent the pinned contact line from retracting on this timescale,\nand indeed no evidence of a stick-slip condition is observed. Yet the\nsize of the ﬁnal stain is similar for the two anticoagulant cases\n(Fig. 11a, second column), suggesting the possibility that the blood\ndid not pin on the ﬁnger-coated glass in the ﬁrst place.\nThe notion that the contact line of the bloodstains with the\ndeactivated anticoagulant are less likely to pin than with the\nactivated anticoagulant is supported by additional stain features in\nFig. 11. When the stain fragments, the fragments appear closer\ntogether when clotting can occur. Additionally, the small stain left\non \nthe \ntilted \nsuperhydrophobic \nsurface \nvanishes \nwith \nthe\ndeactivated anticoagulant. Multiple tests were done to demon-\nstrate that this effect was repeatable. The high-speed images of the\nimpact show that this drop completely detaches from the interface\n(Fig. 11b), demonstrating that it is possible for a drop of blood to\nimpact a coated surface without leaving a visible trace.\nA \nﬁnal \ncurious \ndiscrepancy \nbetween \nthe \nactivated \nand\ndeactivated anticoagulant bloodstains is the stain proﬁle and\ncrack pattern on the clean glass (Fig. 11a, ﬁrst column). For the\nhuman blood with the activated anticoagulant, there is a rim\nsurrounding the stain that is darker than the interior, suggesting\nthat it might be thicker. Along this rim, there are regularly-spaced\nradial cracks. These crack patterns are similar to those described by\nBrutin et al. [38]. In contrast, the human blood with the deactivated\nanticoagulant has a rim that is lighter than the interior, suggesting\nthat it might be thinner. Rather than form cracks at constant angles\nfrom the center, a single crack is observed at a constant radius. This\nobservation suggests that the anticoagulant may fundamentally\nalter the drying process, which could have implications to blood\ndrying studies beyond forensics. It is important to note, that the\npresent evidence relies on experiments with blood that has been\npreviously spiked with anticoagulant, which could potentially\ndiffer from fresh blood. Nevertheless, the presence of clotting itself\ndoes not appear to negate the results from this paper.\n4. Conclusions\nTo investigate the effect of microscopic coatings on a bloodstain\nsize and shape, systematic drop impact experiments were\nconducted using dual-view high-speed imaging and time-lapse\nphotography. Three nearly invisible coatings were applied to glass\nslides: natural secretions of a ﬁngerprint, vegetable oil and a\nsuperhydrophobic coating. In contrast to prior studies in which\nsurface conditions were essentially immaterial to the staining\nprocess, the results of this study illustrate that the effects of these\nspeciﬁc coatings on bloodstains can be dramatic. At low impact\nvelocity, the stain size relative to the clean glass reduced by 35% for\nﬁngerprint coated glass, 49% for oil coated glass, and 72% for ﬂat\nsuperhydrophobic coated glass. When the superhydrophobic\ncoated glass was tilted slightly, the blood drop could leave the\nsurface with a minuscule stain (96% reduction) or no stain at all. At\nthe higher impact velocity, not only was the stain smaller than the\nclean surface, but drop spatter was observed around the primary\nstain. High-speed imaging revealed that size differences were\nlargely due to drop receding dynamics within the ﬁrst milliseconds\nof impact and suggests that these coatings may have prevented the\nstain from pinning to the surface at the point of maximum\nspreading. This reduction in contact line pinning appears to allow\nthe stain to continue shrinking during the drying stage. When the\nanticoagulant in the human blood drops was deactivated to allow\nfor clotting—a process likely to occur in actual crime-scene\nFig. 11. Images illustrating the effect of blood clotting on the ﬁnal stain pattern (a). Regardless of whether the anticoagulant is activated or deactivated, the coatings have a\nsimilar effect on the bloodstains. The conditions are identical to those in Fig. 4 bottom row (here repeated in top row for comparison). Note a few distinct differences that are\nrepeatable and potentially signiﬁcant—including the complete absence of a stain on the tilted superhydrophobic surface.

Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Introduction\nThe Organization of Scientiﬁc Areas Committee’s (OSAC)\nbloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) subcommittee has recently\nreported a call to determine the differences between fresh, whole\nhuman blood and various blood substitutes for use in research,\ntraining and case experimentation [1]. The subcommittee suggests\nthat further research can help with understanding the relationship\nbetween the physical characteristics of blood and other ﬂuids and\nthe mechanisms that cause pattern formation [1]. This work\ncomplements this idea by exploring the contributions of surface\ntension, density and viscosity to droplet spread and passive drip\nstain formation of various forensic blood substitutes (FBS).\nPreviously, our sol–gel formulation has demonstrated validity\nin passive dripping simulation [2]. We can further evaluate the\nutility of our materials by investigating the ﬂuid dynamics of\nspread. We extend our previous data set [2] by creating more\ndroplets of various size and impact velocities. This helps to provide\na more comprehensive understanding of droplet spread in\npractical crime scene reconstruction. We can then compare the\nresults of the sol–gel materials to the expected whole human blood\nrange in passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. Validation of a\nforensic blood substitute is an important component of its\nimplementation into research and training exercises. This is\nparticularly true with commonly encountered [3], well researched\n[4] and extensively taught [5] bloodstains patterns associated with\nbloodletting events.\nDroplet impact and spreading dynamics have been heavily\nexplored in the literature [6]. Traditionally, spread has been\nmodeled in bloodstain pattern analysis, and other areas of ﬂuid\ndynamics, using either the droplet’s Weber number and/or\nReynolds number [4,7]. A recent study suggests that the accuracy\nof the model can be enhanced by blending terms from both the\ncapillary and viscous regimes of the ﬂuid [8]. Our work supports\nthis idea, and we use the Scheller and Bouseﬁeld relation [9] to\nlinearize the spreading ratios of six different ﬂuids. This work\nextends previous work that uses the correlation as a platform to\ntest candidate FBS materials [10] as it can be used to express both\nNewtonian and non-Newtonian spreading by using a ﬂuid’s high\nshear, or effective viscosity [11].

Prior studies have demonstrated that the size and shape of a bloodstain on a smooth surface are\ndetermined from impact dynamics and to a lesser degree by the target material itself. Yet, these studies\nhave relied on clean surfaces, and it is unclear whether the presence of microscopic coatings and residues\ncould signiﬁcantly alter the size or shape of the dried stain. Here, in the present work, experiments are\nconducted to demonstrate that various coatings, such as the sebaceous residue from a latent ﬁngerprint,\ncan dramatically alter the size and shape of the stain from the moment of impact through the drying\nprocess. These experiments also highlight that a drop impacting a tilted superhydrophobic-coating glass\nsubstrate can cause the blood drop to completely recoil without leaving a stain. Relying on a combination\nof high-speed and time-lapse photography, the speciﬁc stages in the stain evolution responsible for the\ndeviations from the current models are identiﬁed. At a relatively low impact velocity, the stain sizes on\nthe coated glass surfaces were 35–72% smaller than on the clean glass surface. At a higher impact velocity,\nthe stains on the coated surfaces were not only smaller, but also contained drop spatter around the\nprimary stain that was not observable in the absence of the microscopic coatings. The reduction in\nbloodstain size did not appreciably change when a chemical was added to deactivate the anticoagulant\nand allow the blood to clot.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nFor over a century, blood pattern analysis (BPA) has been used\nby forensic scientists with the intention of reconstructing crime\nscenes [1–8] using the evidence in court to either provide missing\ndetails or to challenge or support a witness's testimony. In\nsituations where blood spatter is present, the size of blood stains\nare often associated with the force involved, whereas the shape\nand location of the stains can provide insight into an approximate\narea of origin [9]. Here detectives use a stringing technique to ﬁnd a\nregion of origin by assuming blood drops follow straight lines [10],\nan assumption that can overestimate the height by tens of\ncentimeters [11,8]. Within the last decade, methods have been\ndeveloped to back out the in-ﬂight parabolic trajectories of the\ndrops that account for gravitational and drag effects [12]. To apply\nthese methods, accurate estimate for the initial drop size and\nimpact velocity are required.\nNumerous studies have been carried out to relate the drop\nsize \nand \nimpact \nvelocity \nto \nthe \nﬁnal \nsize \nand \nshape \nof\nbloodstain [13–17]. \nThese \nstudies \ntypically \nrelate \nimpact\nconditions with the number of spines radiating from the dried\ndrop [13] or—in the absence of spines—with the stain size\nitself [15]. These relations appear to depend predominantly on\nthe impact conditions [16], with some corrections based on the\ntarget properties [14,17]. Thus, under the same impact conditions,\nthe bloodstain size might differ if the target were glass as opposed\nto polycarbonate. It is noteworthy that in almost all experiments\ninvestigating bloodstains, the target is cleaned before impact.\nHowever, at a crime scene, a surface may have unknown coatings\nor contaminants which may be invisible to the eye. For example, a\nwindow pane may be coated with ﬁngerprints, a kitchen counter\nwith a microscopic layer of oil, or a storefront with commercially-\navailable, superhydrophobic, anti-grafﬁti paint [18]. Here, a natural\nquestion \narises: \ncan \nthe \npresence \nof \nmicroscopic \ncoatings\nfundamentally alter the size or shape of the dried stain?\nThis study investigates the effect of microscopic coatings on the\nﬁnal bloodstain size and shape from the vertical impact of a single\ndrop of human blood.

Recently, several attempts have been\nmade at reconstructing ballistic trajectories backwards, considering the effects of gravity and drag forces.\nHere, we propose a method toreconstructthe regionof origin ofimpact bloodspatterpatternsthat considers\nﬂuid dynamics and statistical uncertainties. The ﬂuid dynamics relies on deﬁning for each stain a range of\nphysically possible trajectories, based on known physics of how drops deform, both in ﬂight and upon\nslanted impact.

Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is one of many techniques of\nforensic science and crime scene investigation [1,2]. Besides the\ndetermination of the mechanisms causing speciﬁc collections of\nstains (patterns), BPA also aims at reconstructing blood spatter\npatterns — patterns generated by impact of airborne drops on a\ntarget surface. For spatter patterns, the determination of the 3D\nlocation of the spatter producing event \u0003 the region of origin \u0003 is\nrelevant to criminal cases. Note that the term region of origin used\nthroughout the manuscript departs from current standards [3] in\nBPA, which recommend area of origin. We ﬁnd that term confusing\nbecause of its 2D technical meaning, while the origin of a spatter is\nclearly a 3D region of space which the work in this manuscript\nidentiﬁes and measure as a volume. As translated from the 1939\nextensive and seminal BPA study of Balthazard et al., “The problem\nof reconstructing curved trajectories is very difﬁcult to solve” [4].\nIndeed, proper backward reconstruction of the trajectory of a\nsingle drop relies on the determination of the three impact velocity\ncomponents, as well as the drop volume, the latter necessary for\nthe consideration of drag forces along the trajectory.\nBackward trajectory reconstruction typically involves the\nfollowing steps: (1) the inspection of the roughness, cleanliness\nand wickability of the target surface, the surface where the stains\nare located; (2) the selection of a sufﬁcient and tractable number of\nstains out of many (sometimes more than 10,000 [5]) blood stains\nat the target surface; (3) the measurement of size, shape and\norientation of those stains; (4) the inference of impact conditions\nbased on measurements in (3); and (5) the backward reconstruc-\ntion of drop trajectories compatible with the stains and impact\nconditions; and (6) the identiﬁcation of a region of origin in 3D\nspace. Current trajectory reconstruction methods [6] are called the\nmethod of strings or the tangent method, and assume that blood\ndrops travel in straight trajectories from the area of origin to the\ntarget surface. Software based on same method and assumptions is\navailable and used in crime scenes [7,8].\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: attinger@iastate.edu (D.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

[42] pioneered the scientiﬁc\ninvestigation of drop impact for BPA, investigating experimentally\nand rigorously how the fall height of a drop inﬂuences the shapes\nof stains, for both normal and oblique impact. These authors took\ncare to discriminate interesting ﬁndings from useable ﬁndings, and\nrecorded ﬁrst high-speed movies of blood drop impact. Indeed the\nrelation between the shape of a stain and the impact conditions of\nthe related drop is key for reconstructing trajectories.\nAs of today, impact is probably the best understood of the four\nchronological stages described in this review (drop formation,\nﬂight, impact and staining). An excellent exposition of the current\nknowledge in BPA on drop impact is available in the recent review\nof Adam [14].\nBefore the early 2000s, the BPA community named the blood\nspatters in relation to the speed associated with the spatter\ngeneration, with the terms of Low, Medium or High Velocity Impact\nSpatter [5]. The reason was to acknowledge an inverse correlation\nbetween the stain sizes and the magnitude of the velocity or\nmomentum applied to the static blood to produce the spatter.\nLater, this classiﬁcation scheme was reconsidered after observing\noverlapping stain sizes between the Medium and High Velocity\ncategories. A novel taxonomy, with examples in the left column of\nTable 4, was proposed by The Scientiﬁc Working Group for\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN, an FBI-founded interna-\ntional group). The taxonomy classiﬁes the stains in three categories\n[5] based on the mechanisms driving the staining process: passive\nstains are caused by gravity as the only driving force; spatter stains\nare formed by additional forces besides gravity, such as the\nmomentum of an impact, and altered stains exhibit the inﬂuence\nof physical or physiological events occurring after the staining\nprocess, such as cleanup attempts, decomposition or ﬂaking.\nNormal impact\nWhen the impact angle a = 908 (see Fig. 7b), the impact is\nnormal to the target. An impact under any other angle is called\noblique, and will be treated subsequently as it involves a more\ncomplex and asymmetrical deformation of the drop.\nUpon normal impact, the contact diameter between the drop\nand the target surface expands until it reaches a maximum, in a\nprocess called spreading. In [42], a relation was found experimen-\ntally between the height of a drop in free fall, and the diameter of\nthe stain: the higher the fall, the larger the spreading and stain size.\nFig. 8. Examples of how uncertainties on physical parameters inﬂuence the determination of the area of origin of a blood spatter: (a) Effect of uncertainty in the impact angle;\n(b) effect of uncertainty in impact velocity; (c) effect of uncertainty in drop diameter; d) estimated heights of area of origin for initial conditions reported in Figs. 7 and 8. In\nﬁgures (a–c), the baseline case is the same as in Fig. 7, while a representative error of +10% is assumed for the overestimation curve, and of \u000310% for the underestimation curve.\nD.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Each analyst received 15 or 16 targets,\nand a response sheet associated with each target. A number was\nplaced at the top of each target; this identified which target cor-\nresponded to each response sheet and indicated the pattern align-\nment during pattern construction. No two analysts received the\nsame targets.\nEach of the manipulated variables was counterbalanced across\nthe other variables and across the entire sample.\nThe response sheet included the following instructions: “You\nare preparing your final report for investigators, which could\nend up being presented in court. Please give your opinion as to\nthe pattern type or types that could account for the stains on the\nsample target.”\nA list of pattern types, along with SWGSTAIN definitions,\nwas provided as follows: cast-off, drip trail, impact, saturation,\nsplash, transfer, drip, expiration, pool, spatter from gunshot\ntrauma (forward or back spatter), swipe, insect stain, drip stain,\nflow, projected (e.g., arterial), and wipe.\nAnalysts could select any number of patterns, or indicate that\n“I can’t state that any of the above patterns would account for\nthe stains on the sample target.”\nAfter classifying all target patterns, analysts emailed or posted\ntheir responses to the independent third-party.\nResults\nError and Accuracy Rate Determination\nAnalysts’ responses were considered correct if they selected\nthe pattern type that represented the true mechanistic cause for\npattern (or selected this pattern type among multiple selections).\nAnalysts’ responses were considered incorrect if the true pattern\ntype was not selected in their choice(s). If analysts could not state\nthat any of the listed patterns could account for the target pattern,\ntheir responses were considered inconclusive. If analysts had clas-\nsified the pattern by indicating all listed types as possible, these\nresponses would have been considered inconclusive; none did so.\nPattern Classification Accuracy\nTwenty-seven analysts made judgements on 15–16 target pat-\nterns each, yielding 416 unique assessments. Three assessments\nwere removed from the analysis because no response was provided;\n413 responses remained. In total, analysts were correct for 69.5%\nof classifications and made errors for 13.1% of classifications. The\nremaining 17.4% of responses were inconclusive. Chi-squared (v2)\ntests were performed to determine whether the frequency of correct,\nincorrect,\nand\ninconclusive\nresponses\nvaried\nsignificantly\n(p < 0.05) as a function of each of the variables under examination.\nEffect of Pattern Type\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of ana-\nlysts’ correct, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\npattern type, v2 (6, N = 413) = 13.871, p = 0.031. This was\nmainly due to analysts’ success in identifying expirated patterns\n(81% correct compared to 64–69% for the remaining types; Fig. 1).\nEffect of Pattern Extent\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of\ncorrect, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\npattern extent, v2 (4, N = 413) = 26.74, p < 0.0001. As might\nbe expected, analysts’ accuracy improved as the extent of blood-\nstaining in the pattern (essentially the number of stains present\non the target) increased (Fig. 2). Rather than the decrease in\nstaining extent increasing analysts’ propensity to make errors,\nthe decrease in correct classifications was matched with an\nincrease in inconclusive classifications.\nEffect of Target Substrate\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of\ncorrect, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\nthe substrate on which the bloodstain patterns were deposited, v2\n(4, N = 413) = 38.64, p < 0.0001. Analysts made the greatest\nnumber of correct classifications on the white-painted surface,\nfollowed by the wallpaper surface (Fig. 3).

When a positive context was presented, ana-\nlysts were less likely to make an incorrect classification than\nwhen the context was neutral, with the overall error rate drop-\nping from 11% to 8%. Conversely, when a negative context was\npresented analysts were more likely to make an incorrect classi-\nfication than when the context was neutral, with the overall error\nrate increasing to 20%. The rate of inconclusive decisions was\nhighest when the contextual information contained no directional\ncues (21%), relative to when there were positively (15%) or neg-\natively biasing cues (16%).\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of clas-\nsification decisions in bloodstain pattern analysis. To do this,\nwell-trained and highly experienced analysts examined over 400\nspatter patterns on rigid non-absorbent surfaces, representing sur-\nfaces frequently encountered at crime scenes. Four spatter pattern\ntypes commonly encountered in crime scene investigations were\nused. The extent of available pattern, the nature of the substrate,\nand the type of contextual information were varied in a balanced\nexperiment designed to determine the effect of these variables\non pattern classification accuracy.\nAnalysts were required to classify the pattern to a standard\nrequired for court. To do this, analysts were allowed to select\none or more pattern classifications that they determined could\nnot be excluded. Within the chosen range of conditions, the\n17.4% overall rate of inconclusive decisions gives some measure\nof interpretation difficulty for the patterns created in this study.\nWhere a classification was made, either by choosing a single\npattern or by nominating more than one pattern, 13.1% of these\nclassifications did not include the correct pattern type. This find-\ning can be considered the first approximation of an overall error\nrate for bloodstain pattern classification on rigid non-absorbent\nsurfaces.\nSome patterns were more reliably classified than others. In\nparticular, the error rate was 4% for expirated patterns compared\nwith 19% for impact patterns. The characteristic features of expi-\nrated patterns (e.g., mucus strands and air bubbles) were gener-\nally evident within these patterns, which could explain why this\npattern type was the most recognizable. The second most recog-\nnizable pattern type was cast-off spatter. Many of the distinctive\nfeatures of a cast-off pattern, such as a linear or curvilinear dis-\ntribution of stains, were also generally present in the cast-off pat-\nterns prepared in this study.\nOther than a lack of distinctive features in a pattern, it is not\nclear why the proportion of incorrect classifications for impact\nand firearms-related spatter patterns was higher. It is possible\nthat the features that were observed in these patterns were those\nshared by other pattern types. For example, many of the impact\npatterns had a somewhat narrow distribution of stains, similar to\ncast-off. Indeed, on closer observation of the data, many of the\nimpact patterns were incorrectly classified as cast-off. Firearms-\nrelated spatter patterns in this study did not always have a large\nproportion of the very small “mist” stains usually associated with\nthis pattern type, which may explain why firearms related spatter\nwas excluded as a mechanism for some of these patterns.\nLooking more closely at the other variables used in this study,\nit is evident that where the amount of available pattern was lim-\nited or the substrate made stain visualization more difficult (e.g.,\nchipboard)\nthe\nproportion\nof\ncorrectly\nclassified\npatterns\ndecreased. However, the reduction in classification accuracy was\ngenerally accompanied by an increase in the proportion of incon-\nclusive responses. So where the pattern was more difficult to\nrecognize, analysts became more conservative in their judgment,\nwhich is what is to be expected from a reliable method.\nThe error rates estimated from this study are based, in part, on\nthe conditions chosen for examination. These conditions were\ndesigned to be a fair representation of real casework but remain\nthe subjective judgement of the experimenters. In particular, the\npatterns used in the study were restricted to common spatter\ntypes. Had other more easily recognized pattern types, such as\ndrip stains, drip patterns, transferred blood, and saturation pat-\nterns been included, the proportion of correct classifications may\nhave been higher. In addition, the size of the targets meant that\nin many cases the analysts received only a portion of the total\npattern. As well as reducing the number of bloodstains available\nfor analysis, the limited pattern size meant that it may not have\nbeen possible to perform other analyses such as area of origin\ndeterminations. Even with a small number of stains and only a\nportion of the complete pattern available, however, many ana-\nlysts were prepared to make a classification. Finally, the use of a\ncoating of lacquer removed the potential to perform any chemi-\ncal tests on the bloodstains, which may have hindered analysts’\nability to confirm, for example, the presence of saliva to indicate\nexpirated blood. It is worth noting that some of these limitations\nexist in casework, especially where analysts are working solely\nfrom photographs. While any of these limitations could have\nreduced the classification success rate, none would be expected\nto increase erroneous classifications, because such errors mean\nthe correct pattern type has been excluded.

The authors found correlations for experi-\nmental data for a variety of liquids against Reynolds numbers\nof up to 25,000 and Weber numbers of up to 4000 for ReI\nagainst the number of spines and the ratio of stain size to drop\nsize. This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation\nnow (mis)printed as\nReI / ðRe1=2We1=4Þ0:75\nð11Þ\nhereafter referred to as ReIM.\nHowever, the above work only considered the vertical impact of\nblood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-\nface. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the\nvertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little\nwork on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either\nonto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45\u0002\nto validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the\nflow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).\nBy looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper\nthis paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine\nthe impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for\nwhich the vertical impact is simply a special case.\nExperimental Technique\nAs in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has\nbeen shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood\nwas mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.\nBlood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood\nto be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37\u0002C and removed\nonly when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were\ncarried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in\na fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at\nthe end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),\nviscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)\nfor pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).\nThe blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at\nheights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,\nresulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-\nette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-\nferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–\n5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting\nof blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically\nto impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give\nimpact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90\u0002 to the hori-\nzontal. For the 22.7\u0002 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used\nand for the small pipette at 90\u0002 to the horizontal, extra heights of\n20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-\nard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,\nand surface slope was repeated six times.\nThe last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-\ntom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at\n1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured\nusing the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera\nsoftware version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly\nusing the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the\ndroplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that\nif inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it\nwas taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size\nwas measured and the number of spines around the entire stain\n(360\u0002) was counted by hand. For each angle and height, the results\nwere averaged over the six replicates. The stain size and number of\nspines were then plotted against a number of variables to obtain a\ncorrelation coefficient.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the effect of impact angle on the number of\nspines obtained and the stain size and shape. As shown in previous\nwork (1), as the impact angle increases, i.e., becomes closer to a\nvertical impact, the stain becomes shorter, until for a vertical\nimpact a circular stain is generated (Fig. 1a). What has not been\ndiscussed before is that the number of spines also alters as the\nimpact angle alters. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the number of\nspines increases as the impact angle increases. As the drop size or\nimpact velocity increase the stain size and number of spines also\nincreases for an angled impact, Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, as pre-\nviously demonstrated in Ref. (17) for a vertical impact.\nVertical Impact\nTo compare the results against work by previous authors, at first\nonly vertical impacts were considered with the correlation coeffi-\ncients, R2, given in Table 1 for stain size and Table 2 for number\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFIG. 1—Blood stains falling from 100 cm for a medium sized pipette at\nangles of (a) 90\u0002, (b) 78.8\u0002, (c) 61.6\u0002, (d) 43.5\u0002, and (e) 33.7\u0002 to the vertical.\nKNOCK AND DAVISON\n• POSITION OF THE SOURCE OF BLOOD STAINS\n1045\n 15564029, 2007, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00505.x by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

Using together the measured values of h (in meter,\nnoted m) and t (in second, noted s), and the physical principle\nthat a valid equation needs to have the same units on both sides\nof the equal sign, we ﬁnd the equation for the travel of the drop as\nh = 1/2gt2, where we have identiﬁed in g the gravity constant\nwith units of, necessarily, m/s2. We might then realize that a drop\nthat falls from higher than one meter typically takes more time\nthan predicted by the equation h = 1/2gt2. The culprit for slowing\ndown the drop is the drag, the resistance force exerted by the air\non the moving drop. Fig. 3a shows values of the drag force on\nspherical drops moving through air, as a function of their\nvelocities and diameters. The drops have various diameters,\nrepresentative of BPA situations. For low velocities and small\ndrops, the relation is a straight line because the drag force is\nproportional to v; for larger and faster drops, the relation\nbecomes a parabolic curve indicating that drag forces become\nproportional to v2. The transition between these two behaviors\n(proportional to v and then to v2) occurs at different velocities for\ndifferent droplet sizes.\nIn contrast, Fig. 3b describes the same relationship between drag\nand velocity in a dimensionless way, and all the results of Fig. 3a\ncollapse along a single curve. To do so, the drag force is reported as\nthe drag coefﬁcient (CD, deﬁned as in Eq. (2) and (3) below) and\nplotted against the Reynolds number (deﬁned in Table 2). The\ninformation conveyed with the dimensionless plot in Fig. 3b is the\nvery same as in the dimensional plot of Fig. 3a, except that one\ndimensionless curve replaces several dimensional curves.\n(b) A dimensionless plot tells more about the physics at play\nthan multiple dimensional plots: In the dimensionless plot of\nFig. 3, the transition between a linear and parabolic relationship\nbetween the drag coefﬁcient and the velocity v corresponds to the\ntransition between the region where CD decreases with Re, and the\nregion where CD is constant with Re. This transition occurs over a\nwell determined range of Reynolds number, corresponding to a\nchange of physical regime, i.e. a change in the respective\nimportance of inertial and viscous forces (Table 2): at low Re\nthe ﬂow is steady and drag is mostly caused by friction forces,\ncorresponding to a linear dependence between CD and Re, while at\nRe higher than \u0004100 unsteadiness and turbulence develop, as\nexempliﬁed by the pictures of the ﬂow at Re > 104. This chaotic\nmotion of the air around the droplet corresponds to inertial forces\nbeing the main cause of the drag, overcoming viscous forces, and\nresults in a parabolic relationship between CD and Re. The ability to\nsee the transitions between dominant forces comes with the use of\ndimensionless numbers in FD.\nAn illustrative example of the advantages a and b of using\ndimensionless numbers in BPA is provided by the impact velocity\nmap elaborated in Fig. 4. This map provides the impact velocity\n(expressed by the contours of ratios of impact velocity to terminal\nvelocity) of a drop striking a target, as a function of the initial\nrelease conditions (i.e. initial drop diameter d0 and initial velocity\nv0). For simplicity in Fig. 4, v0 is oriented downwards, and the target\nis placed horizontally, one meter below the release location. The\ninitial conditions in Fig. 4 are representative of various conditions\nencountered in BPA, with 10\u00033 mm \u0006 d0 \u0006 5 mm and 0.1 m/\ns \u0006 v0 \u0006 240 m/s.\nIn this situation of a drop ﬂying towards a target, only two\nforces are active: the weight of the drop, and the drag between the\ndrop and surrounding air. The motion of the droplet towards its\ntarget can be accurately computed, considering how these two\nforces affect its initial velocity and position during the ﬂight.\nMathematically, this motion is described by Newton’s second law:\nmd\ndv\n*\ndt ¼ md~g \u0003 ~FD; \n(1)\nwhere md; d~v=dt;~g and ~FD are the droplet mass, droplet accelera-\ntion, gravitational acceleration and drag force, respectively.\nThe above equation simply means that during the time of its\nﬂight, the velocity of the droplet is modiﬁed by two forces, its\nweight and the drag.\nThe value of the drag force is expressed with the correlation\n~FD ¼ raCD\nAd\n2\n~vv; \n(2)\nwhere ra, Ad, v and ~v are the air density, the cross-sectional area\nof the droplet, the velocity magnitude and velocity vector of\nthe droplet. The dimensionless parameter CD\nis the drag\ncoefﬁcient of a spherical object such as a drop, as plotted in\nFig. 3b. For BPA cases, CD is best expressed by the correlation of\nLavernia et al.

The method \ngenerates metrics relating to the individual stains as well as the overall pattern, including bloodstain pattern \nspecific metrics such as the gamma angle, circularity, solidity, area of convergence, stain density and pattern \nlinearity. This method provides an objective approach to the analysis of bloodstains and bloodstain patterns and \ncan generate a wealth of quantitative data that is currently not obtainable using manual techniques or other \nimage-based programs currently utilised in the discipline. This method will be useful to analysts and researchers \ninvestigating the application of quantitative methods to bloodstain pattern analysis.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is a discipline of forensic science \nthat is concerned with the study of the size, shape and distribution of \nbloodstains deposited onto surfaces at bloodletting events, particularly \ncrime scenes. With knowledge of the underlying principles of fluid \nmechanics, the physical characteristics of the stains can be analysed and \nused to assist with the reconstruction of the events that led to the \nbloodshed [1–3]. One of the key tasks in BPA is the classification of \nspatter patterns. Spatter patterns are groups of small circular and \nelliptical shaped bloodstains that have been formed as the result of some \nexternal force being applied to a source of liquid blood [4]. The current \nterminology of the different classes of spatter patterns in BPA relate to \nthe mechanism of the force that caused them. Common types of spatter \npatterns present at crime scenes include impact (caused by an object \nstriking liquid blood), swing cast-off (caused by blood released from a \nbloodstained object due to its swinging motion), and expirated (caused \nby the generation of droplets due to the force involved with the expul­\nsion of blood from the mouth, nose or lungs) [4]. The application of \nthese forces on the liquid blood results in its breakup into smaller \ndroplets that travel through the air away from the blood source. When \nthese predominately spherical droplets land onto nearby surfaces they \ncollapse and spread on the target forming circular and elliptical shaped \nbloodstains.\nBPA can be a valuable tool in investigations; however, the subjec­\ntivity of the discipline has been criticised [5,6] and disagreements be­\ntween trained analysts have been documented in some high-profile cases \n[7,8]. A lack of empirical data and scientific foundations was cited as \nareas needed for improvement [5]. These criticisms have raised doubt \nover the reliability of the evidence that is often delivered in courtrooms. \nIn response, reliability and black box studies have been undertaken to \ninvestigate the accuracy and reliability of bloodstain pattern classifica­\ntion. These studies have shown that some spatter patterns can have high \nerror rates for classification [9–11]. This is not unsurprising as the me­\nchanical process involved in the formation of spatter stains is the same \nregardless of the initial force applied. As a result, there are overlapping \ncharacteristics between different types of spatter patterns (for example, \nthe range of stain sizes in a pattern) which can lead to ambiguity or \nmisclassification. Studies have also shown some analysts are not always \nconsistent with their classifications, classifying the same pattern \ndifferently when unknowingly presented with it a second time [12]. The \ninference being that there is a subjective approach to the classification \nprocess. There have been calls for more systematic guidelines within the \ndiscipline to assist with the classification task, but currently there is still \nno agreed criteria about what features are required to make a classifi­\ncation and the decision is left to the analyst based on their training, \nexperience and level of confidence.\nTo reduce the subjectivity, quantitative methods have been \n* Correspondence to: 27 Creyke Road, Ilam, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: rosalyn.rough@esr.cri.nz (R.

    "text_chunk": "forwardand backward spattered droplets. The difference is\napparent from the ﬁrst data point of the analysis at a time from\nthe bullet impact in the 0.4–0.5 ms range, all the way to the end of\nthe experiment. For either caliber, the forward spattered velocity\nis larger than that of the backward spattered velocity, even\nthough in Fig. 1a, the velocity gap is only noticeable starting at the\n0.8–0.9 ms mark from the bullet impact time, which may be due\nto a large number of droplets difﬁcult to resolve. A larger forward\nspatter velocity makes physical sense due to the entraining effect\nof the bullet traveling in the direction of the blood spatter. It is\nalso interesting to note that as the time from the bullet impact\nincreases, the standard deviation of the data, as indicated by the\nerror bars, decreases due to a more uniform ﬂow ﬁeld in the\ncorresponding part of the region of interest. The trend of the steep\ngradient upward and steady decrease in average velocity (cf.\nFig. 1) indicates that at the onset of the analysis which was at\n0.4 ms after the bullet impact, the blood droplets are accelerated.\nThis means (from the second law of Newton applied to an\nindividual droplet) that droplets analyzed at the onset of the PIV\nanalysis practically do not experience air drag but on the contrary,\nare pulled forward by the aerodynamic wake of the fast moving,\nsmall-sized, preceding droplets from the initial splash. This is\nsimilar to the aerodynamic interaction of birds ﬂying in V\nformation [43]. After about 0.6–0.9 ms, the blood droplets ﬁnally\nbegin to slow down due air drag, since at the later stage droplets\nhave already sufﬁciently separated and their mutual aerodynamic\ninteraction has been diminished. It should be emphasized that\nnot only in forward spatter droplets are initially accelerated but\nalso \nin \nthe \nbackward \nspatter \n(cf. \nFig. 1). \nTherefore, \nthis\nacceleration cannot be attributed to the aerodynamic effect of\nbullet preceding droplets in forward spatter but to the mutual\nentrainment of droplets described above.\nThe tape-covered sponge of experiment 7Cb3 only produced\nforward spattered droplets and the results from the PIV analysis\nare shown in Fig. 2. Since the same bullet caliber and shooting\ndistance as in experiment 7Ab1 were used, the results in Fig. 2 can\nbe directly compared to the forward spatter case of Fig. 1b.\nCovering the sponge with tape prevents the onset of backward\nspatter. Due to the spread of the error bars, an accelerated droplet\nmotion due to the aerodynamic wake of the preceding droplets is\nstill plausible, however, it is not directly seen in Fig. 2. The\nmagnitude of the average velocity is approximately that of the\nforward spattered case shown in Fig. 1b. The trend of a decrease in\nthe error bar spread at longer time is still seen, albeit to a lesser\nextent.\nThe two experiments with silicone-covered sponges, 7Db1 and\n7Db2, were conducted using the same caliber of bullet and the\nsame \nshooting \ndistance. \nThe \nresults \nfor \nthe \n7Db1 \nand\n7Db2 experiments are presented in Fig. 3.\nEven though experiments 7Db1 and 7Db2 were conducted under\nexactly the same conditions as indicated in Table 1, 7Db1 only\nresultedin forward spatter, whereas7Db2 revealedbothforwardand\nbackward spatter. This sheds light on the complexity of performing\nrepeatable BPA experiments: it means that for this set of\nFig. 1. PIV results for experiment 7Aa1 are shown in panel (a), and for experiment 7Ab1 in panel (b). The red dashed line with circular data points represents the results from\nforward spatter, and the solid blue line with square data points is for backward spatter. The error bars are the standard deviations of the sets of data. Note that the data points\nare slightly offset from their corresponding time reckoned from the bullet impact moment in order to more easily distinguish the error bars.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck.

Meyer\nIFFB Gerichtsmedizin und Forensische Neuropsychiatrie, Paris-Lodron Universita¨t Salzburg, O¨sterreich, Austria\nIn cases of unclear circumstances, the deposition of bloodstains,\nespecially backspatter on a ﬁrearm or a shooter, can considerably\nassist in the reconstruction of shooting incidents. In shots to the\nhead, biological material (such as blood and brain tissue) is ejected\nback towards the weapon. This phenomenon can lead to the\ndeposition of bloodstains on the trigger, trigger guard, weapon and\nsupporting hand and thus can be used to determine whether and in\nwhich position a person has ﬁred a weapon. [1–4] However, in\ncertain cases a peculiar distribution of bloodstains on the hand of a\nvictim can cause confusion. In this case, atypical bloodstain pattern\ncould be seen on the hands of a probable suicide victim. Due to the\nexcessive bloodstains on the right side of the body, the position of\nthe gun on the left side of the body and no motive, an autopsy was\nperformed.\n1. Case background\nA 90-year-old man was discovered dead in his house. He was\nfound sitting in an upright position, leaning back against a folded\ndeck chair (Fig. 1). The right side of his body was profusely covered\nin blood. A blood pool could also be seen on the ground next to him,\noriented towards his right elbow. In the right temporal region,\nthere was a circular wound, which was covered with blood. On the\nleft side of the body, a pistol was detected (Fig. 2). The left arm\nrested on his left thigh. According to family members, the deceased\ndid not mention any suicidal intentions, and there was no history\nof mental or physical illness. A suicide note was not found.\n2. Weapon\nThe weapon used was a ‘Walter PPK 7.65’, a blowback-operated\nsemi-automatic pistol with a traditional double-action trigger\nmechanism and a single-column magazine, calibre 7.65 mm (Fig.\n3). The pistol was in the lawful possession of the deceased.\nUncharacteristic bloodstains were found on the ﬁrearm. The\ndistribution of blood showed no preferential site. Inconsistent\ndroplets were widely spread over the weapon. An angle of\nincidence could not be calculated. Projected patterns were mainly\nfound on the right outer side of the slide. Individual stains were\neven detected on the rear side of the grip. No bloodstains could be\nseen in the lower region of the grip.\n3.

Apart from the location of the entrance wound, wound path trajectory\nand gunshot residue, blood stain pattern analysis of gunshot-related backspatter on the hands of the\nvictim can be an essential tool not only to determine which hand was holding the ﬁrearm, but also to\nreconstruct the position from which a weapon was ﬁred. We present a case of a 90-year-old man, who\nwas found dead in his house. Because of unclear circumstances and an unusual position of the deceased\nwith a gunshot entrance wound to the right temporal region and a ﬁrearm found on the left side of his\nbody, an autopsy was performed. Due to the unusual bloodspatter stains on the hands and the ﬁrearm, it\nwas possible to deduce the position and orientation of the hands and the ﬁrearm of the deceased. We\ncould reconstruct that the man held the weapon in his right hand, using the left hand to stabilise the\nﬁrearm and the right thumb to pull the trigger. A contact shot to the right temple led to central regulatory\nfailure due to extensive brain injury. The manner of death was concluded to be a suicide.\n\u0002 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The analysts were given the following instructions:\nYou have 10 votes to use at each step. Allocate your votes according\nto your opinion. Give more votes to your favoured option(s), and fewer\nvotes to your less favoured option(s). Assign zero votes to options that\nyou have ruled out. At the end of each step, your votes should combine\nto total 10.\n2.3. Procedure\nThe analysts completed the analyst characteristic measures before\nthe pattern classiﬁcation task.\nThe analysts were ﬁrst presented with the target pattern in the ab-\nsence of any contextual information, and asked to allocate their votes ac-\ncording to the instructions outlined above. Then, if they believed it would\nassist with their analysis, analysts could request one item of contextual\ninformation at a time from the six listed items. The order in which context\nitems were listed was counterbalanced across participants.\nAfter receiving each requested context item, the analysts were able\nto revise their allocation of votes on a new response sheet. This process\nwas repeated until either: 1) an analyst was satisﬁed that no further\ncontextual information would assist with his or her analysis, or 2) an\nanalyst had requested all six items of contextual information.\nIn addition to their ﬁnal vote allocation, analysts were asked to write\ndown their ﬁnal pattern classiﬁcation—the pattern type or types that\nthat they would include in their BPA report. We used this written\nclassiﬁcation to determine analysts' accuracy.\n2.4. Data analysis\nAnalyses were conducted under an empirical Bayesian framework\n[24–28], primarily because this approach provides for robust handling\nof small sample sizes. All Bayesian tests performed are alternatives to\nestablished frequentist tests. The main difference in interpretation is\nthe replacement of classical p-values and corresponding conﬁdence in-\ntervals with 95% highest density intervals (HDI).1 All computations\nwere carried out in the statistical software package R [29], using various\nfunctions within the Bayesian First Aid package [30].\n3. Results\n3.1. Classiﬁcation performance\nWe determined classiﬁcation performance according to three main\nfactors: overall accuracy, requests for contextual information, and opin-\nion update (i.e., vote shift).\n3.1.1. Overall accuracy\nIn addition to making their ﬁnal vote allocation, recall that the ana-\nlysts were asked to write down their ﬁnal pattern classiﬁcation. We\ncategorised the accuracy of this classiﬁcation according to whether it\nwas deﬁnitively accurate, conservatively accurate, incorrect, or incon-\nclusive. A deﬁnitively accurate response was assigned if analysts record-\ned only one pattern classiﬁcation and it was the ground-truth pattern\ntype (i.e., “cast-off”). A conservatively accurate response was assigned\nif analysts included cast-off among multiple classiﬁcations, or classiﬁed\nthe pattern as “spatter stains”.2\nIf analysts recorded a classiﬁcation that did not include “cast-off” or\n“spatter stains” then the response was considered incorrect. If analysts\ndid not respond at all, or they indicated that there was not enough detail\nin the pattern to make a decision, their response was scored as inconclu-\nsive. The distribution of accuracy scores, and resulting proportion anal-\nyses according to experience level, are displayed in Table 2.

A work colleague, Mr.\nSimon Peters, has gone to Mr. Sing's home after he failed to\nshow for his 7 am work shift, and has found his body in the\nback yard.

A scene examination revealed bloodstaining on\nthe walls and ﬂoor in the hallway leading to Mr. Sing's\nbedroom, and also on the west facing bedroom wall.\nMedical ﬁndings\nAn autopsy shows that Mr. Sing died of a combination of blunt\nforce trauma to the head and subdural haemorrhaging.\nInjuries to the eyes and nose were consistent with an object\nimpacting Mr. Sing's face with considerable force.

Discussion\nIn order to be able to reconstruct the events at a crime scene,\nforensic investigators study the shapes, sizes and distribution of\nbloodstains. Together with autopsy ﬁndings about injuries, a\nmedically and scientiﬁcally based reconstruction of possible\nwounding mechanisms is possible [5].\nBased primarily on the characteristics and location of the\nentrance wound and direction of bullet path, the presented case\nwould be classiﬁed as a suicide. [6] However, the ﬁnal position of\nthe weapon on the left side of the body in relation to the entrance\nwound on the right side of the head and intensive bloodstains on\nthe weapon and body was the cause of speculation about the\ncorrectness of this primary assumption.\nIn most cases, blood spatter on the hands of a victim or a\ndefendant are usually neglected in favour of those found at the\ncrime scene. Nevertheless, several publications show that the\nanalysis of backspatter is an important tool for mathematical and\nphysical modelling of blood spatter and thus enables the\nreconstruction of the gun’s position and the manner in which it\nhas been used [7–9].\nIn the case at hand, parallel bloodstains on the back of the right\nhand, thumb and index ﬁnger together with the discreetly visible\nstains on the extensor side of left thumb and index ﬁnger suggest\nthat the back of the right hand was directed away from the area of\norigin. Backspatter on the dorsal part of the thumb and index ﬁnger\nindicates that the blood was projected away from the wrist in an\noblique angle towards the inner part of the ﬁngers and palm of the\nhand and towards the ﬁngertips. Taking into account the fact that\nthe palm of the right hand was free from spatter, the weapon must\nhave been held backwards in the right hand with the right thumb\nembracing the trigger (Fig. 8a and b). This reconstruction is\nsupported by the extensive bloodstains on the index ﬁnger, as it is\nthe most prominent part at this precise position, facing away from\nFig. 1.

This study proposes that bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation can become a distinct\nand logical process by implementing an automated approach. To do this, an automated bloodstain\npattern recognition system was developed to enable the distinction of two types of spatter bloodstain\npatterns. First, global pattern features based on common bloodstain pattern properties were extracted\nfrom laboratory-generated impact spatter and cast-off bloodstain patterns. Following this, automated\nfeature selection methods were used to identify the combination of features that best distinguished the\ntwo bloodstain pattern types. This eventually led to the training and testing of a Fisher quadratic\ndiscriminant classiﬁer using separate subsets of the generated bloodstain patterns. When applied to the\ntraining dataset, a 100% classiﬁcation precision resulted. An independent dataset comprising of\nbloodstain patterns generated on paint and wallpaper substrates were used to validate the performance\nof the classiﬁer. An error rate of 2% was obtained when the classiﬁer was applied to these bloodstain\npatterns. This automated bloodstain pattern recognition system offers considerable promise as an\nobjective classiﬁcation methodology which up to now, the discipline has lacked. With further reﬁnement,\nincluding testing it over a wider range of bloodstain patterns, it could provide valuable quantitative data\nto support analysts in their task of classifying bloodstain patterns.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nRecognising patterns based on a sizeable body of knowledge\nthat has been stored in the human mind is regarded as a\nprerequisite to human expert decision-making [1]. Humans\nhave developed sophisticated methods of sensing and inter-\npreting patterns in the environment. Pattern recognition is\ncentral to a number of forensic disciplines including bloodstain\npattern analysis (BPA). The recognition of bloodstain patterns\nrelies primarily on the identiﬁcation of the pattern’s diagnostic\nproperties and an evaluation of the possible mechanisms by\nwhich the pattern was deposited. Together these form the\nprocess bloodstain pattern analysts term pattern classiﬁcation.\nThe limitations of pattern classiﬁcation as currently practiced, are\nthe qualitative nature of determining the properties of the pattern\nand the subjective judgement required to infer the pattern’s causal\nevent [2,3]. It is evident that this process encourages the formation\nof early mechanistic conclusions about the cause of a pattern\nbefore a full set of observations has been made [4]. This problem is\nexacerbated by the use of standard discipline terminology [5],\nwhich is largely mechanism-based. In fact, BPA taxonomies [6,7]\nform the backbone of bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation. So the\nboundary between observation and interpretation or reconstruc-\ntion can become blurred [8]. A key reason for this and other\npersisting issues, is the lack of a rigorous and standardised BPA\nmethodology [3,8]. Deﬁning a formal BPA methodology is the\nsubject of ongoing discussion among BPA practitioners [9–11].\nComputers offer a wide range of capabilities that can both assist\nand emulate human decision-making. Pattern recognition has\nbeen deﬁned as the study of how computers observe the\nenvironment, learn to distinguish patterns of interest and make\nreasonable decisions about different categories of patterns [12].\nPattern recognition systems can be based on identifying the pre-\n* Corresponding author at: The University of Auckland, School of Chemical\nSciences, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: ravishkaa@gmail.com (R.M.

Experimental setup\nIn this study, bloodstain patterns formed by forward spatter on flat, \nplain, and light- colored surfaces due to gunshot wounds are investi­\ngated using image processing and numerical modeling methods. For the \nexperimental setup (Figs. 1 and 2), the blood used for both back spatter \nand forward spatter is aimed to mimic human blood. Thus, cow blood is \nselected as the most suitable option based on the literature review [5]. \nSoft sofa sponges, measuring 13x10x7 cm, are soaked to absorb 50 ml of \nEDTA-anticoagulated cow blood each are then utilized during shootings. \nIn various studies, white cardboard has been used as a target surface to \nobserve the resulting forward spatter bloodstain patterns [6–11]. Sub­\nsequently, bloodstain images were taken with a Canon EOS 1200D \ncamera using an 18–55 mm lens. The shooting settings were adjusted \nbased on lighting conditions to ensure image clarity, with an aperture of \nf/4.5, a shutter speed of 1/100 s, and an ISO of 6400. The images were \nrecorded at a resolution of 3368 × 4776 pixels with a bit depth of 24 and \na DPI of 72.\n2.2.

The \ncode initially receives a bloodstain pattern image from the user. In the \ncase of a colored image, the code converts it to black-and-white for \nbetter identification of the stains. Later, it converts the image to binary \nformat so that the bloodstains appear as white on a black background. \nWith the ‘regionprops’ function, the code analyzes each of the ellipses in \nthe image and calculates their major and minor axis lengths, eccen­\ntricities, centroids, and areas. Using these features, it selects bloodstains \nthat are small, elliptical, and within a certain size range (the minimum \narea for selected ellipses is 5-pixel, whereas the maximum area for \nselected ellipses is 500-pixel) so that only the appropriate stains are \nutilized in the analysis.\nBy utilizing the discussed methodology, a set of cardstocks that are \nthe outcome of the experiment which are the combination of different \nreal AOx distances and different shooting distances are analyzed. The \nreal AOx distances are 5 cm, 35 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm while the \nFig. 1.

With this in mind, the larger droplets within the high-\nspeed images were found to be >0.8 mm diameter and traveling\n<3 m⁄sec. Therefore, ignoring drag is expected to introduce no\nmore than 30% error in predicting the z-coordinate in this experi-\nment. This is quite substantial and highlights that any attempt to\nincorporate projectile motion into AO modeling must take drag into\naccount.\nAO error associated with size and xy-coordinate was calculated\nusing the stain triangulation lines at the point with which they\ncrossed the known x-axis, which runs perpendicular to the spatter\nflight direction. For each spatter pattern, the xy-coordinate was\nmeasured as the average offset between each triangulation line and\nthe known xy-coordinate, while AO size was measured as the 95%\nconfidence interval of this average. These calculations are presented\nin Fig. 12.\nNo statistically significant correlations were found between the\nobserved errors, and blood volumes and velocities tested. XY-coor-\ndinates were found to be quite accurate, with the least accurate\nspatter pattern deviating from the known xy-coordinate by only\n4 mm. On the other hand, the AO size was found to be larger than\nexpected. The known blood droplet diameters tested were 2.7 and\n3.2 mm, while the calculated sizes ranged between 7.8 and\n14.3 mm, representing a two- to fivefold increase. Further analysis\nof these results revealed a number of outliers present within each\ntrial. This was investigated further.\nOne of the 24 spatter patterns was selected randomly for addi-\ntional analysis. The stain selection criteria were lowered to include\nstains that could provide a measure of directionality only. This\nresulted in the selection of 54 stains. For the purpose of this analy-\nsis, instead of starting at each stain and triangulating ‘‘backward,’’\nthe known xy-position was used as the starting point and lines were\ndrawn ‘‘forward’’ out to each stain. Where each line overlapped the\ncorresponding stain, the rotational offset could then be evaluated.\nOf these 54 stains, the rotational offsets of 14 (26%) were signifi-\ncant enough that it was reasonable to assume that any individual\ntasked with fitting an ellipse to a bloodstain was unlikely to have\narrived at the same triangulation line. Four of these representative\nstains are shown in Fig. 13 each with their corresponding triangula-\ntion path originating from the known xy-coordinate. This finding\nclearly demonstrates that a component of AO error is not related to\nanalyst measurement but is instead inherent in the process of blood\ndisplacement and disintegration.\nPostimpact droplet formation is the most likely mechanism for\nthis contribution to AO size error. This ‘‘fork in the road’’ effect\noccurs when a blood volume structure (sheet, filament, or large\ndroplet) has traveled a certain distance from the AO and reaches\nan instability threshold where it disintegrates into smaller volumes.\nSubsequently, trajectory lines for these respective bloodstains will\ntriangulate back to this fork in the road where secondary disintegra-\ntion occurred, instead of back to the true AO. Given that this\nexperiment was designed to reduce the complexity of droplet disin-\ntegration, it is likely that this will be more predominant under\nbloodshed conditions more typically associated with crime scenes.\nConclusion\nSmall volumes of blood were disintegrated through the applica-\ntion of pressurized air. The resulting spatter patterns were used to\nevaluate BPA AO error and investigate the underlying mechanisms.\nUnder these experimental conditions, z-coordinate predictions were\nconsistently overestimated by an average of 50%, while using the\nlowest z-coordinate within a spatter pattern reduced this error to\n8%. However, if this value is to be reported, it should be presented\nas an estimate and not as a maximum height calculation. Incorpora-\ntion of projectile motion into z-coordinate calculations was found\nto underestimate by an average of 28%, while velocity predictions\nwere found to be quite accurate when compared with the high-\nspeed photographs. However, the application of projectile motion is\nlimited at this time as an assumption related to launch angle was\nrequired,\nand\nthe\nimpact\nof\ndrag\ncould\nnot\nbe\nignored.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nvelocity (m/sec)\nerror (%)\nD = 0.2mm\nD = 0.4mm\nD = 0.6mm D = 0.8mm\nD = 1.0mm\nD = 1.2mm\nD = 1.4mm\nD = 1.6mm\nFIG. 11—Effect of drag forces on blood droplets between 0.2 and 1.6 mm\nin diameter, traveling up to 10 m ⁄ sec.

    "text_chunk": "Research into the dynamics of fluids other than blood offers\nsome insight into this complex interaction (13–15). It begins when\nan object strikes a liquid source, transferring energy through com-\npression and forcing liquid displacement away from the strike\npoint. The amount of transferred energy will correlate with the\ndegree of fluid displacement. As the liquid undergoes displacement,\nthe ratio of surface area to volume increases. To counter this insta-\nbility, the displaced liquid will either recoil through counteracting\nsurface tension forces or disintegrate into smaller fragments where\nthe energy is great enough. Ultimately, aerodynamic forces govern\ndroplet size. The higher the velocity of blood displacement, the\ngreater the instability created at the liquid–gas interface, resulting\nin the generation of smaller droplets. This provides some support\nfor the current correlations made within the BPA community\nbetween bloodstain size and droplet velocity. Liquid displacement\nis quite complex, however, and not all of the liquid will be travel-\ning at the same velocity. This could result in a variety of droplet\nsizes, in addition to the generation of sheets and filaments. As\nblood has a relatively high viscosity when compared to water, this\nincreased resistance to flow will counteract displacement and\nincrease the probability of encountering sheets and filaments, as\nreadily observed in Fig. 1. Unlike droplets, sheets and filaments are\ninherently unstable because of their higher surface area-to-volume\nratio and will either recoil into a single droplet or further disinte-\ngrate into multiple droplets.\nOnce airborne, droplet flight trajectory is governed by the effects\nof gravity and drag (or air resistance). Gravity results in downward\ndroplet acceleration and can be modeled using the following pro-\njectile motion equations:\nyðtÞ ¼ \u0002 1\n2 gt2 þ voyt þ yo\nð2Þ\nvyðtÞ ¼ \u0002gt þ voy\nð3Þ\nayðtÞ ¼ \u0002g\nð4Þ\nvxðtÞ ¼ vox ¼ vo cos ho\nð5Þ\nxðtÞ ¼ vxot þ xo\nð6Þ\naxðtÞ ¼ 0\nð7Þ\ntan h ¼ vy\nvx\nð8Þ\nThe force applied to the body of a droplet in motion by the sur-\nrounding air is called drag and acts in the opposite direction of\ndroplet motion. The value of drag force can be calculated using the\nfollowing equation:\nFDrag ¼ CD\n1\n2 qairV2 p\n4 D2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\nð9Þ\nwhere q is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, and D is the\ndroplet diameter. CD is the coefficient of drag, which is a function\nof Reynolds number and depends on the shape of the object. The\nReynolds number for a sphere is defined as:\nRe ¼ qDoVo\nl\nð10Þ\nwhere D is the droplet diameter, and l is the fluid viscosity.\nThe aim of this research was to utilize a novel experimental\ndesign to investigate the error associated with the standard calcula-\ntions for AO. Starting with a mock crime scene experimental\napproach, the initial volume of blood was significantly reduced,\nand the disintegration process was propagated through the applica-\ntion of a short burst of pressurized air. These two modifications\nallowed for better resolution of the disintegration process to provide\na window into the underlying mechanisms responsible for AO\nerror.\nMaterials and Methods\nA gas tank filled with pressurized air was connected to a nozzle\nvia stainless steel tubing. A pressure gauge was used to measure\nair pressure, while a solenoid valve with digital pulse generator\nensured a controlled release of air from the nozzle. This apparatus\nwas contained within an aluminum frame structure to allow for ver-\ntical adjustment. Iron plates secured to the structure ensured it\nwould not move during operation. A diagram of this experimental\nsetup is shown in Fig. 2.\nA syringe, mounted within a syringe pump to regulate flow rate,\nwas connected to a stainless steel needle using clear plastic tubing.\nThe syringe and needle were clamped within the apparatus such\nthat a droplet suspended from the needle would be directly within\nthe path of pressurized air released from the nozzle. Pig blood was\nchosen owing to similarities in physical properties with human\nblood. The reader is directed to our previous article for additional\ninformation regarding these properties (10).\nFresh pig blood was obtained from an abattoir (Quality Meat\nPackers, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and stored in test tubes contain-\ning the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The\nblood was stored at 4\u0003C and was used within 48 h of collection.\nBlood was placed into the syringe pump, which was then utilized\nto deliver a specific volume of blood, resulting in consistent sized\nblood droplets suspended from the needle tip. Droplet diameter was\nmeasured directly from the high-speed images taken immediately\nprior to disintegration, using the needle diameter as a calibration\nreference.

To\nadequately discern between these models, we rely on differing\npredictions for the role of the underlying substrate. In particular,\nthe direct-contact model would be expected to depend on the\nsubstrate thermal properties, and a more detailed analysis of this\ndependence is developed in the next section.\nPredicting the Amount of Exchanged Heat. The mechanism of\nﬁnite-time heat exchange between a drop and a superhydropho-\nbic substrate in the absence of a gas layer and coating can be\nmodeled analytically. Here, we approximate the energy evolution\nas one dimensional and consider conduction as the main mech-\nanism of heat transfer (Heat Transfer Mechanism). If we model\nthe heat ﬂux ˙q(t) and contact radius r(t) as decoupled, then the\ntotal heat transferred by a single drop over a residence time tr\ncan be estimated as Q =\nR tr\n0 ˙q(t)πr(t)2dt. The contact radius ini-\ntially spreads to a maximum radius before retracting back to zero.\nThese spreading and retraction dynamics can be approximated\n(1) using the relation r(t) = 2rm\nq\nt/tr −(t/tr)2.\nTo calculate the heat ﬂux ˙q(t), we model the drop and sub-\nstrate as two semiinﬁnite bodies at different initial temperatures,\nTℓfor the liquid and Ts for the substrate, that are brought into\ncontact and achieve temperature equality at the contact surface,\nT(z = 0, t) (Fig. 4A). For conduction-dominated heat transfer,\nthis semiinﬁnite approximation is appropriate when the thermal\ndiffusion length √αtr is less than the thickness of the material.\nProvided that the drop does not spread too thinly, this condi-\ntion is met for both the drop and the substrate during their rapid\ncontact.\nBy imposing the condition that the two bodies have an\nequal contact temperature during contact time, the standard\nheat equation can be solved analytically (33), revealing a\ntime-independent contact surface temperature of T(z = 0, t) =\n\u0000p\n(kρcp)ℓTℓ+\np\n(kρcp)sTs\n\u0001\u000e\u0000p\n(kρcp)ℓ+\np\n(kρcp)s\n\u0001\n. Here\ncp is the speciﬁc heat and the subscripts s and ℓdenote the prop-\nerties of the substrate and liquid, respectively. It follows from\nthe self-similar analysis that the heat ﬂux into the substrate is\n˙q(t) = ks(Ts −T(z = 0, t))/√παst. Combining the relations for\nthe heat ﬂux and the contact radius, the amount of heat trans-\nferred Q =\nR tr\n0 ˙q(t)πr(t)2dt is\nQ = 2.8\nksρℓ\n1/4(rm/R)2∆T\nγ1/4√αs\n\u0010\n1 +\np\n(ρcpk)s/(ρcpk)ℓ\n\u0011R11/4.\n[2]\nFrom a scaling perspective, Eq. 2 is equivalent to the relation\nQ/∆T ∼R2.75 presented in the previous section and thus also\nconsistent with the data in Fig. 3A. However, in addition to pro-\nviding a coefﬁcient, Eq. 2 also provides falsiﬁable predictions\ninto how the spreading factor and material properties of the liq-\nuid and the substrate affect the heat transferred.\nA natural way to nondimensionalize the transferred heat Q is\nto normalize it by the maximum possible heat transfer mcp∆T,\nwhere m is a drop mass. Noting that m = 4\n3πR3ρℓ, the normal-\nized heat exchange can be expressed as\nQ\nmcp∆T = 0.7\n\u0010rm\nR\n\u00112 \u0010\n1\n1 + M\n\u0011 \u0012ρℓα2\nℓ\nRγ\n\u00131/4\n.\n[3]\nIn this form, it becomes clear that for a given spreading fac-\ntor, the model predicts that the fraction of potential heat trans-\nferred is controlled by two dimensionless parameters: one relat-\ning the thermal-inertial capillary dynamics of the drop ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ\nand the other relating the thermal properties of the material\nM = kℓ√αs/ks√αℓ.\nExperiments\nA\nB\nFig. 4.\nComparison between model and experiment.

(B) For a given spreading fac-\ntor rm/R (symbol color), the portion of energy exchanged depends on two\ndimensionless groups, one based on dynamic properties ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ and the\nother on material thermal properties M (symbol shape). The experimental\ndata (symbols) are consistent with the theoretical results with rm/R = 1.4\n(solid lines).\nThe ﬁrst dimensionless group identiﬁed in our analysis,\nρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ, may be interpreted as the square of the ratio of\nresidence time tr ∼\np\nρℓR3/γ to the thermal diffusion time\ntd ∼R2/αℓ. For millimeter water drops, ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ is of the order\nof 10−7, which implies that the drop bounces ∼2,000 times faster\nthan the time needed for the heat to thermally diffuse across the\ndrop. The stark difference in timescales supports the semiinﬁ-\nnite approximation. Furthermore, the scaling highlights the com-\npeting inﬂuence of drop size. A larger drop will have a longer\nresidence time than a smaller drop; yet the increase in diffu-\nsion time is greater and therefore the ratio of these timescales\ntr/td decreases. These two timescales become comparable for\nsufﬁciently small drops; yet for water, this size is less than a\nnanometer or near the molecular scale. Therefore, we would\nexpect ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ ≪1 for most water drops and comparable\nliquids.\nThe other control parameter identiﬁed in our analysis is\nthe material factor deﬁned as M = kℓ√αs/ks√αℓ. This factor\nrelates the thermal heat transfer between the liquid and the sub-\nstrate and therefore depends solely on the thermal properties of\nthese two materials. If the substrate transfers heat signiﬁcantly\nfaster than the drop, then the heat transfer is rate limited by the\ndrop and M →0; whereas if the substrate transfers heat slower\nthan the drop, then the heat transfer is rate limited by the sub-\nstrate and M →∞. For a water drop on a glass substrate, the\nrelative heat transfer rates are comparable and M = 1.\nThe experimental results illustrated in Fig. 3 are rescaled in\nterms of the dimensionless groups presented in Eq. 3 alongside\nthe theoretical prediction for a spreading factor of rm/R = 1.4\nShiri and Bird\nPNAS\n|\nJuly 3, 2017\n|\nvol. 114\n|\nno. 27\n|\n6933\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 92.30.172.63 on June 24, 2025 from IP address 92.30.172.63."

For violent crimes\ninvolving gunshots, standard practice in police departments worldwide have some physical limitations.\nFor instance, the effect of gravity and air drag on trajectories of blood droplets are neglected using current\nreconstruction methods, which results in a well-known overestimation of the height of the source of\nblood. As a consequence, more sophisticated models for blood spatter trajectory reconstruction are being\ndeveloped, two of which are highlighted in the present work. They allow the prediction of bloodstain\npatterns produced from backward spattered blood droplets from blunt and sharp bullets. Our recent\nmodels attribute the splashing of blood to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability which arises when blood is\naccelerated towards lighter air. This physically-based description comes with the powerful predictive\ncapability to correlate features of bloodstain patterns with the speciﬁc bullet and gun that produced\nthem, as well as with the body position. The results of the numerical models were compared with four\nexperiments simulating blood spatter deposition on a vertical wall through the number of stains\nproduced, average stain area, and average impact angle at the surface, and the agreement found is fairly\ngood. Moreover, further insight is obtained by probing and explaining the inﬂuence of observable\nparameters on the resulting spatter pattern, with the goal of aiding BPA experts evaluating a crime scene.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the inspection of blood\nspatter patterns which were produced due to violent crimes [1].\nThe goal of BPA is to provide answers to questions arising from the\nscene of a violent crime such as what caused these patterns.\nDetermination of the region of origin of the blood spatter is\nexpected from the BPA community [2], however, current techni-\nques lack a fundamental basis in ﬂuid mechanics [3]. Namely, the\nmethod of strings, or the trigonometric method, which has been in\nuse since as early as the 1950s [4] and is implemented in widely\ndistributed software [5–9], neglects physical realities such as\ngravity and air drag [2]. Understandably, this results in signiﬁcant\nwell-established errors [10,11], for example, there can be a 50%\noverestimation of the height of the region of origin [12]. Moreover,\nthe widely used formula for the determination of the impact angle\nof a blood droplet, sin α = W/L [13], where W is the width of the\nstain and L is the length, has major ﬂaws since the values of sine of\nthe impact angle are practically indistinguishable between 75\u0001 and\n90\u0001. Namely, they vary from 0.97 for 75\u0001 and 1 for 90\u0001, and is the\nreason that standard BPA practice encourages stains with impact\nangles less than 60\u0001 be used for reconstruction [1].\nAdding to the difﬁculty of an accurate reconstruction model of\nblood spatter patterns is the rheological complexity of blood. Blood\nis a non-Newtonian, shear thinning [14–16] complex aqueous\nsolution containing various cells and proteins in plasma, and\nbegins to coagulate as soon as it is outside of the human body\n[17,18]. Moreover, \nits rheological behavior depends on \nthe\nhematocrit [14,19], it exhibits viscoelasticity [16,19–21] and\npossesses a yield stress [22]. This rheological behavior is important\nin crime scene reconstruction because it can affect the atomization\nprocess [23–26], which is diminished in liquids which exhibit\nviscoelastic properties [26–28]. Resultant droplet sizes are also\ninﬂuenced by these effects [29–34] as well as their ﬁnal impact on\nsurfaces [31,35,36]. Additionally, blood droplets are spattered at\nbody temperature and often are subject in ﬂight to air at a different\ntemperature, the effects of which have been investigated [37], but\nnever in the context of BPA.\nWith some of these challenges in mind, several models have\nbeen developed to attempt to better recreate crime scenes.\nIncluding the effect of drag via a probabilistic approach was\nproposed in Refs.

The theoretical model is able to predict not only the\nscaling trend in the data, but also the prefactor; both exper-\niment and model indicate that ∼1% of the available heat is\nexchanged during the bounce of a millimeter-sized water drop\non a superhydrophobic-coated glass substrate. Additionally, as\nthe spreading factor rm/R is increased, holding the other param-\neters constant, the amount of heat transferred increases as well,\nas predicted in the model.\nReturning to the two potential models proposed earlier, the\ndirect-contact model depends on the substrate thermal proper-\nties, whereas the air-cushion model does not. Speciﬁcally, the\nmodel predicts that less heat would be exchanged by the bounc-\ning water drop if the glass substrate were replaced by more insu-\nlating materials, such as synthetic rubber (M = 2.6) or natural\nwood (M = 4.2). To test this prediction, we repeat the experi-\nmental procedure with neoprene rubber and pine wood instead\nof glass. The measured thermal properties of these materials are\nprovided in Table S1. A thin superhydrophobic layer of soot is\ncoated on the rubber and wood substrates following the same pro-\ncedure used for the glass substrate. Thus, the superhydrophobic\nsurfaces in all samples were identical, whereas the underlying sub-\nstrates differed. Experimental data for heated water drops bounc-\ning on the rubber (square symbols) and wood (circle symbols) are\nplotted along with the theoretical predictions (Fig. 4B). The\nresults conﬁrm that the substrate material—even under a layer\nof soot—affects the amount of heat exchanged Q during the drop\nbounce, providing evidence for the direct-contact model.\nAn interesting feature of the direct-contact model is that,\ncounterintuitively, a smaller drop can transfer a larger fraction\nof its potential heat than a larger drop even though the smaller\ndrop is in contact with the surface for less time (Fig. 4B). This\nresult is a consequence of the self-similar conductive heat trans-\nfer into the drop and substrate. Indeed, the opposite trend—\nlarger drops transferring a larger fraction of potential heat—\nwould be expected if the heat transfer was regulated by a layer of\ntrapped gas with a ﬁxed depth. These trends are further compli-\ncated if the spreading factor rm/R also varies. Nevertheless, our\nﬁndings taken at a constant spreading factor (Fig. 4B) illustrate\nan important concept: Smaller drops may contact the surface for\na shorter time than larger drops, yet during this time, the smaller\ndrop encounters a larger average heat ﬂux from the self-similar\nconduction.\nCooling from Multiple Drops. Although the focus of this paper has\nbeen on the heat exchange of individual drops, most applications\ninvolve multiple drops. For example, many birds have feathers\nthat are superhydrophobic (7, 21); however, exposure to cold rain\ncan adversely cool a bird (34, 35) and in extreme cases has been\nlinked to hypothermia and death (36, 37).\nOur results measuring the small fraction of potential heat\nexchanged with a drop on a superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 4)\nsuggest that a solid body would be noticeably warmer throughout\na cold shower if drops rapidly bounced off the surface rather than\nbecoming stuck. Additionally, these results suggest that at the\nsame ﬂow rate, the bouncing of smaller drops would exchange\nmore heat than that of larger drops, provided that the spreading\nfactor for the smaller drops was similar to or greater than that of\nthe larger drops.\nTo evaluate these predictions, we measure the temperature T\non the underside of a suspended duck feather on top of which a\nsteady stream of drops impacts. These feathers (Fig. 5A) have\na barb and barbule microtexture (Fig. 5B) that enables their\nnatural superhydrophobicity. We compare identical experiments\non a feather that is superhydrophobic and a feather that has\nbeen made superhydrophilic through plasma irradiation (38) and\nindeed ﬁnd that the undersides of feathers are warmer when cold\ndroplets bounce rather than stick (Fig. S3).\nA superhydrophobic feather can also be used to explore\nthe extent that drop size might affect the amount of heat\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFig. 5.\nCooling from different-sized drops impacting at ambient tempera-\nture onto a warmed feather.

To explore this possibility, two streams of drops\nwere released simultaneously, one larger (R ≈2 mm) and\none smaller (R ≈1.1 mm), with identical ﬂow rates 1 mL/min\nand similar spreading factors rm/R ≈1.3 and 1.7, respec-\ntively (Fig. 5C). Here the drops were at the ambient lab-\noratory temperature 26 ◦C, whereas the feather was heated\nto 40 ◦C, the approximate body temperature of a bird (39)\n(Fig. S4).\nA time-averaged thermal image from below the feather (Fig.\n5D) reveals that the regions under which the large and small\ndrops fall are indeed cooler than the surrounding regions, even\nthough the drops are the same temperature as the ambient air\non the top side of the feather. The locations under which the\ndrops fall, as well the midpoint between these two locations,\nare denoted with black circles in Fig. 5D. The average temper-\nature within these circled regions varies with time (Fig. 5E).\nBefore the experiment begins (t < 0), the temperature within\nthese three regions is indistinguishable. As drops bounce off the\nfeather, the midpoint temperature remains steady whereas the\ntemperature on the opposite side from where the drops fall cools.\nThese temperatures ﬂuctuate, with the region associated with the\nsmaller drop having a lower average temperature than that of the\nlarger drop.\n6934\n|\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1700197114\nShiri and Bird\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 92.30.172.63 on June 24, 2025 from IP address 92.30.172.63."

Horse blood was\ndropped vertically onto three calico fabrics with different mass per unit areas (85.1 g/m2, 163.5 g/m2 and\n224.6 g/m2). Six different impact velocities were used (1.7 ms\u00011, 2.9 ms\u00011, 4.1 ms\u00011, 4.9 ms\u00011, 5.1 ms\u00011 and\n5.4 ms\u00011). The dry bloodstains were largest on the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. The low\nyarn linear density and large inter-yarn spaces meant that the blood could wick into the yarns from all\ndirections and along the intra-yarn spaces. The calico with the middle mass per unit area had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area for four out of the six velocities. The twist level for this calico was greater than\nfor the calicos with a heavier or lighter mass per unit area. This reduced the amount of wicking which\noccurred along the yarns due to the tighter yarn structure. The calico with the heaviest mass per unit area\nhad the highest yarn linear density resulting in a thicker fabric, so the blood could not as easily penetrate\ninto the fabric. This resulted in a thicker wet blood layer remaining on the fabric surface, where it\ngradually wicked vertically into the yarns under gravity. Less wicking along the yarns occurred, resulting\nin a smaller bloodstain than on the fabric with the lightest mass per unit area. The correlation between\nimpact velocity and mean dry bloodstain area was greater for the calicos with the medium and heaviest\nmass per unit area than for the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. For the calicos with the\nmedium and heaviest mass per unit area, the distance the blood spread laterally at impact, which\nincreased with the increase in impact velocity, had a greater inﬂuence on the dry bloodstain area than the\namount of wicking.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nAlthough bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has been used by\ncrime scene investigators for over a century [1], questions have\nbeen raised on the scientiﬁc validity of the work [2]. The premise\nof BPA is that the pattern that blood creates when impacting a\nsurface will enable the observer to gain an idea of the events\nwhich occurred to cause the bloodshed. However, the wide\nvariety of creation mechanisms, drop sizes, impact velocities and\ntarget surfaces indicate the complexity of BPA [3]. The reliability\nof pattern classiﬁcation of ﬁve bloodstain patterns on non-\nabsorbent rigid surfaces [4] and fabric surfaces [5] by expert BPA\nanalysts \nhas \nbeen \nconsidered. \nOn \nnon-absorbent \nsurfaces\nincorrect classiﬁcations were made 13.1% of the time [4] and\non fabric surfaces incorrect classiﬁcations were made 23.4% of the\ntime [5].\nAs such, more research is being undertaken on the understand-\ning of the interaction of blood with a variety of surfaces. Work has\nbeen carried out on non-absorbent surfaces (e.g. steel and plastic\n[6]) and partially absorbent surfaces (e.g. paper and wood [7–9]).\nEquations have resulted that use the bloodstain size and number of\nspines \nto back-calculate the impact velocity and \nassist \nin\ndetermination of the origin of the bloodstain [7–9].\nBloodstains on household and clothing fabrics often found at\ncrime scenes are also being researched. To understand bloodstains\non fabrics, it is important to consider wetting and wicking. Wetting\nand wicking are the mechanisms by which liquids move into and\nthrough a fabric [10]. Wetting occurs when the surface energy of a\nsolid overcomes the surface tension of a liquid, allowing the liquid\nto spread on the surface [10]. Once a fabric has been wetted,\nwicking can occur. Wicking is the spontaneous transport of a liquid\ninto a porous system by capillary forces. The rate at which the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: c.knock@cranﬁeld.ac.uk (C.

She was found in a lying position in the bed of their bedroom and died 2 h\nlater in hospital due to the fatal head injuries. DNA analysis suggested a hammer as\nthe likely injury-inﬂicting instrument. At the scene of the crime a bloodstain pattern\nwas found on the ground, wall, ceiling and furniture, as well as bloodstained quilt\nand mattress. The pattern on the ground likely resulted from the work of emergency\npersonnel and as such was no considered further.\nThe question as to whether the woman was attacked in a sitting or a lying\nposition was addressed by the bloodstain pattern analysis.\n2.2. Case 2\nA decomposing male corpse was found in a lying position on the living room ﬂoor\nin an apartment. The approximate time of death was 2 weeks previously. The\nautopsy ﬁndings included several patterned injuries on the head and three\npatterned bone injuries on the skullcap, caused by blunt force.\nBloodstains in the living room were located on the carpet, walls, ceiling and\nfurniture. Bloodstains were also located on the dinette and on the kitchen. A 3D\nmatch analysis of the cranial bone injuries and the presumed injury-causing tools\nlocated within the apartment concluded that a pistol was used to hit the victim\n(http://www.virtopsy.com) [8,9].\nThe majority of the attacks occurred in the living room. In order to deﬁne other\nlocations in which the victim was physically attacked, a bloodstain pattern analysis\nwas performed.\n2.3. Basic information about the creation of blood spatter\nBlood drops, which ﬂy through the air, are from the ballistic point of view always\nspherical [10]. Some oscillation at the beginning of ﬂight can be neglected [11]. In\nblood drops produced by blunt force, the diameter of the drops is generally between\n1 and 3 mm [2,4]. When a drop with a deﬁned angle of less than 908 strikes a ﬂat\nsurface, an elliptical bloodstain arises.\nThe ﬂight distance of blood drops depends on the starting velocity and the cross-\nsection stress (relation of mass to the cross-section plane). The (initially unknown)\nstarting velocity cannot overstep a value of something around 10 m/s. This value\ncan be derived by two physical laws, the ballistic air drag and the surface tension of\nthe blood drop. When a drop exceeds a certain velocity the pressure due to the air\ndrag overcomes the internal drop pressure due to the surface tension and the drop\nbursts into smaller ones. This threshold velocity depends on the size of the blood\ndrop and lies between about 10 m/s (for bigger drops, 6 mm) and 17 m/s (for small\ndrops, 2 mm). Blood drops moving on a parabolic like trajectory must have a quite\nsmaller velocity because the burst of blood drops due to a too high velocity happen\nonly in the immediate vicinity of the source.\nThe mass of the blood drop can be estimated approximately by the diameter\n(width of the bloodstain) and the density of blood. This estimation is precise\nenough because a 10% error in the mass leads to a distance error of less than\n1.5%. When the drop obliquely impacts on the surface, the minor axis of the\nelliptical bloodstain can be determined as the diameter of the drop [3]. The\ninﬂuence of air resistance is a known factor because of the spherical shape of the\nblood drop.\n2.4. 3D documentation of the bloodstain pattern and the scene of crime\nFor the 3D documentation of the scene of crime [12], including the bloodstain\npattern and the traces, we employed a digital close-range photogrammetry system\n(Elcovision 10, PMSAG, St. Margreten, Switzerland) and a tachymeter (Leica TPS\n405), or a laser scanner (Leica ScanStation 2, Leica Geosystems, Gladherbru¨ ck,\nSwitzerland) (http://www. leica-geosystems.com).\nThe digital close-range photogrammetry is a 3D optical coordinate measuring\nsystem that is used to determine precise 3D coordinates of discrete points of an\nobject. Therefore, several pairs of images are taken from different angles so that\nevery object point is visible in a photogrammetric image pair. A pair consists of two\nimages taken from the left and the right-side of the same part of the object (Fig. 1).\nFor taking the photographs, a calibrated digital reﬂex camera Fuji S3 with a focal\nlength of 17 and 30 mm is used.\nThe tachymeter (other term: total station) is a type of theodolite with an electro-\noptical laser distance-measuring unit. It is used to determine the terrestrial or\nspatial position of points by measuring angles and distances between them. With\nthe tachymeter, distances are measured to a reﬂector or directly to an object and the\nmeasurements are drawn automatically in 3D CAD software (AutoCAD 2006\nsoftware, Autodesk, San Rafael, USA with plug-in ElTheo, PMSAG, St. Margreten,\nSwitzerland) on a connected laptop at the scene (Fig. 2a).\nThe 3D laser scanner sends laser beams to the investigation environment whilst\nrotating with a horizontal ﬁeld of view of up to 3608 and a vertical ﬁeld of view of up\nto 3108. The scanner measures the distances and angles from the reﬂected laser\nbeams and computes the 3D coordinates of all reﬂected objects to generate a 3D\npoint cloud consisting of millions of points (Fig. 2b). These point clouds represent\nthe crime scene in detail and with high accuracy.\nThe photogrammetric analysis is combined with the scanned data or with the\nmeasurements taken by tachymetry, using reference targets.\nWith the point clouds of the laser scans or the tachymetry measurements, a true\nto scale drawing of the traces and the crime scene in 3D is created using the\nAutoCAD 2006 software.\nThe shapes of the bloodstains are measured and drawn by photogrammetric\nanalysis using the software Elcovision 10 integrated in the AutoCAD platform. The\nresult is an accurate, true-to-scale 3D model of the crime scene including the\nbloodstain pattern and the traces represented in 2D situation plans and 3D views\n(Figs. 3 and 4).\n[(Fig._1)TD$FIG]\nFig. 1.

Accordingly, we tested our \nmethod on stains of a real impact pattern at the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) where we created \neight impact patterns (n =  8) from a distance of one meter.

When the stain\nsize is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the\ncorrelation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-\nsional number against a nondimensional number.\nThe circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-\nmeterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the\nstain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain\ndiameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as\nb (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape\n(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both\nthe stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4.

Barni et al. / Talanta 72 (2007) 896–913\nunder speciﬁc circumstances, but do not have the high sensitivity\nof luminol [75–77].\nSeveral preparations of luminol have been described and in\nrecent years new preparations, using either patented luminol\nmolecule modiﬁcations or luminol blood-dependent chemilu-\nminescence enhancers [13,28], have been proposed to improve\nsensitivity, speciﬁcity and duration of the emission. How-\never the two best known formulations for luminol testing,\nthe ﬁrst described by Grodsky et al. [18] and the sec-\nond described by Weber [19], continue to be the most\nextensively used by forensic practitioners due to their good\nperformance, simplicity of preparation, low cost and ready\navailability of the ingredients. These protocols are summarised\nin Fig. 11.\nRegardless of the preparation, luminol solution is usually\ndirectly sprayed in completely dark environments. The light\nobtained can be photographed or ﬁlmed while the luminescent\nareas are marked in order to allow their detection once the light\nemission has faded [63,78]. Previous pre-treatment of the sur-\nfaces possessing the stains with 2% hydrochloric acid (HCl),\nrecommended by some authors [79,80], seems to decrease sen-\nsitivity, raising the background chemiluminescence level [73],\nand, furthermore, to have detrimental effects for the following\nDNA typing attempts [63].\nAmpliﬁcation of the luminol chemiluminescent emission by\nmeans of intensiﬁed cameras has been reported in a forensic\ncontext [13,81] but is not in general use at crime scenes.\nDue to the potential irritant effects of luminol, harmful effects\nof the other compounds employed in both preparations, and to\nthe fact that luminol is applied as an aerosol, particular care has\nto be taken in its use (Table 1). Suitable protective equipment\ncomposed of goggles, respirators, gloves and protective clothes\nshould be used by the operators when luminol is sprayed and\nthe area investigated should be aerated after luminol application.\nThe number of people assisting the operations should be limited\nto those strictly necessary [63].\nSubsequent to bloodstain location and photograph documen-\ntation is the collection of the stains for further laboratory testing.\nThe collection method depends on the nature of the substrate on\nwhich the stain is located. For unmovable objects such as tiles,\nwalls or cars the best procedure consists of swabbing the sur-\nface with cotton swabs or other highly absorbing support. Many\nlaboratories use the oral-swabs commonly employed to collect\nreference samples in crime cases. This concentrates all of the\navailable stain in a small area of the swab. Alternatively, in some\ncases, the stains may be removed from the surface by scraping\noff with a scalpel and collecting the removed material.\nWhen the stains are diffuse on a wide unmovable area, e.g.\non a wall surface, it is possible to employ an adsorbent card\ncontainingpreservativesubstanceswhichprotectthebloodstains\n(proteins and DNA as well) from bacterial and fungal hydrolytic\nand oxidative degradation [63,82,83].\nFormovableobjectssuchasfurniturecomponents,smallpan-\nels, carpets and tools, the best and most conservative procedure\nconsists in the collection of the complete object from which the\nstains will be recovered in the laboratory.\nRegardless of how the stains are collected, the essential\nrequirements to be met are the recovery of the available blood,\nthe collection of a control sample in a tested area not exhibiting\nchemiluminescence and the complete drying of the support used\nfor blood collection in order to avoid the microbial and fungal\ndegrading action.\nFig. 11.

Put more succinctly, the data in Figs. 4–6 make clear\nthat stains preferentially occur in left loop legs during contact\ntransfer as opposed to the roughly even distribution that occurs\nduring direct spatter. A key question is: why? In other words, what\ndifferentiates the left loop legs such that blood preferentially\nadsorbs into them during contact transfer?\nOne simple explanation would be that the fabric surface is\nasymmetric, such that the left loop legs protrude further out of the\nfabric surface and simply make contact with the blood more\nreadily than the right loop legs. To test this hypothesis, we used the\nZeta-20 Optical Proﬁler to measure the height proﬁle of the fabrics.\nFigs. 7a and 8a are representative 2D images of the fabric surface\non 100% cotton and 50% cotton/50% polyester as captured by the\nZeta-20 Optical Microscope System. Height information from the\nproﬁler was extracted from representative cross sections, as\nindicated by the three lines of equal length running across the loop\nlegs. The heights at the same relative position on the three lines\nwere averaged and a single height proﬁle extracted as a function of\nlateral position along the line. This procedure was repeated on\nimages of four other randomly selected areas per each fabric type.\nThe resulting average proﬁles are displayed in Figs. 7b and 8b,\nwhich show plots of the average height with respect to normalized\nlateral position for 100% cotton and 50% cotton/50% polyester\nrespectively. On the 2D images, the highest points (maxima) of ﬁve\nloop legs in a given row are labeled as letters A–E, and the\ncorresponding ﬁve peaks in the height proﬁles are likewise labeled\nA–E \naccordingly. \nThe \nheight \ndifference \nof \nthe \nmaxima \nof\nneighboring loop legs was found to be on the order of 20 to\n30 mm for the 100% cotton fabric, and closer to 50 mm for the 50%\ncotton/50% polyester fabric. The topographical surface examina-\ntion shows that the left loop legs are noticeably higher than the\nneighboring right loop legs in term of height. The consistent height\ndifference between adjacent loop legs in opposing orientations is\nlikely to be the explanation for the predominant counts of stained\nleft loop legs over right loop legs. In other words, for transfer stain\npatterns, the protruding loop legs come into contact with blood\nFig. 4.

This approximation suggests\nthat the extent that blood drop spreads follows:\nrf\nR ¼\nWe1=2\n1:24 þ We1=2 Re\u00041=5 : \nð2Þ\nTo compare the current experimental results with these\nprevious model predictions, the Reynolds and Weber numbers\nwere calculated using the impact velocity and drop size observed\nwith high-speed camera along with the measured liquid properties\n(Section 2.2). Fig. 3c shows the predictions from the ﬁrst model,\nEq. (1), plotted with blue diamonds. The measured spreading factor\ncorresponds to the horizontal axis and the predicted value\ncorresponds to the right vertical axis. Similarly, the predictions\nfrom the second model, Eq. (2), are plotted with red squares so that\nthe predicted values correspond to the left vertical axis. If the\npredicted measurements were the same as what was observed,\nthese points would fall on the black line. Fig. 3c demonstrates that\nalthough these models are not identical, both predict the observed\nspreading factor within 10% of the clean glass experimental\nmeasurements.\n3.2. Low impact bloodstains on microscopic coatings and residues\nWe next explore the bloodstains on all ﬁve surfaces in low\nimpact conditions. The images taken one hour after impact show\nthat when bloodstains formed on the various coatings they were\nremarkably different from those that formed on the clean glass\n(Fig. 4). A dotted circle with the size of the clean glass stain had\nbeen added to each image to highlight this difference. In these\nimages, drops with 1-mm radius were released from h = 20 cm and\ndrops with 2-mm radius were released from h = 10 cm. Because the\nimpact velocity scales as U / h1/2, doubling the height for the\nsmaller drops leads to a similar Weber number for both drop sizes\nin the experiments, here approximately We = 160.\nThere are a few noteworthy features in these stains. Not only do\nthe ﬁngerprint and oil coatings lead to smaller bloodstains, but\nthese stains are irregular and fragile. In particular, they more easily\ndelaminate and fracture during drying. For the case of the half\nclean-half ﬁngerprint coated glass, the bloodstain captures the\nasymmetry of the surface coating. On the clean half, the drop dries\nwith the same shape and size as if it were on a fully clean surface.\nWhereas on the coated half, the bloodstain is more compact and\nshares similarities with those on the surfaces fully coated by oil and\nﬁngerprint residues. For the case of superhydrophobic coating,\nwhen the surface was ﬂat, the blood dries as a beaded up drop,\nwhereas when the surface was tilted by a small amount (7\u0001), even\nless volume is left behind. Finally, a keen observer will note that a\nring stain surrounds the principal stain for the larger drop on the\nﬁngerprint coated glass (Fig. 4, 2nd from left, bottom row). This\nring is reminiscent of a coffee stain [35] and suggests that the\ncontact line may have been temporarily stuck or pinned at that\nposition as it dried.\nAdditional insight into how these ﬁnal stains developed can be\ngained by evaluating images of the stains taken at both the\nmillisecond and minute timescale. Fig. 5 shows a series of high-\nspeed images taken at the time of impact for the larger drops that\ndeveloped the stains in Fig. 4 (bottom row). Each column\ncorresponds to a particular time t measured in millisecond relative\nto the time of impact (t = 0). Each row corresponds to a different\nsurface with either a top-view perspective (Fig. 5a) or side-view\nperspective (Fig. 5b). The images show that the drops are spherical\nwith a radius of R = 2 \u00030.1 mm as they impact the surfaces at\nU = 1.5 \u0003 0.1 m s\u00041, leading to a Weber number of We \u0006 160. The\ndrops \nrapidly \nspread \nout, \nreaching \na \nmaximum \nradius \nof\napproximately rmax = 6 mm in approximately 5 ms. At this point,\nthe ﬂattened drop is thicker along its perimeter than center. For the\nblood drop on the clean glass, the drop stays at this size, but the\nthickness proﬁle adjusts so that the thickness decreases from the\ncenter outward.\nBy contrast, on the ﬁngerprint-coated surface, the drop begins\nto retract after reaching a maximum radius (Fig. 5). Indeed, on the\nhalf clean-half ﬁngerprint substrate, the stain retracts only on\nthe ﬁngerprint-coated portion. A similar retraction is observed on\nthe oil-coated glass. On the superhydrophobic surface, the\nretraction dynamics are so extreme, that the blood drop forms\nan upward jet within 25 ms after impact. When the super-\nhydrophobic-coated glass is ﬂat, the blood drop adheres to the\nsurface and the drop returns to the surface intact. However, when\nthe superhydrophobic surface is slightly tilted, the majority of the\nblood drop can bounce off of the impact spot within a fraction of a\nsecond, leaving only a small speck of blood behind (Fig. 5b). To be\nclear, these types of spreading and retraction dynamics after\nimpact are well known for simple liquids, such as water [36,37].\nFig. 3. Comparison of the size of dried human bloodstains on a clean glass surface\nwith the published predictions. (a) The impact velocity U increases with release\nheight h and drop size R. Theoretical predictions (curves) for drop sizes of R = 1\n(small circles) and 2 mm (large circles) indicate that the drops in the experiments\nhave not reached terminal velocity Ut. (b) The shape of the dried bloodstain on the\nglass surface is circular with a ﬁnal size rf that depends on the initial size R and\nrelease height h. The scalebar of 5 mm applies to all images. (c) The spreading\nfactors rf/R = β for the experiments are plotted in terms of the dimensionless groups\nof Weber number We, Reynolds number Re, and contact angle u = 15 (measured\nvalue for clean glass) so that they can be directly compared with two published\npredictions (black line). Note that the square points correspond to prediction based\non the left axis and the diamond points correspond to prediction based on the\nright axis.\n192 \nS.

This criterion serves as an upper bound for the\nallowable velocity of a trial trajectory.\n2) Stain shape criterion: a second criterion is based on the stain\nperiphery being compatible with the deformation occurring of\nthe moving drop upon impact on a rigid target. It has been shown\nthat upon normal impact [30] when inertial forces are negligible\nwith respect to surface tension forces, the periphery of a blood\nstain is a smooth circle. For impacts with higher inertia, of\nmagnitude comparable to surface tension, the periphery of the\nstain exhibits deformation such as waves or spines. Further\nincrease of impact inertia induces splashing [31], visible in [30],\nwhere tiny “splashed” stains surround the leading edge of the\nmainstain. Thismorphological transition,fromsmoothtowavyto\nsplashed stain boundary, was already observed in 1939 [4] for\nnormal and oblique impacts. While its use for trajectory\nreconstruction was considered at the time, it has never been\nsuccessfully implemented, probably because of the abundance of\nparameters inﬂuencing the transition (angle of impact, impact\nvelocity, drop size, substrate roughness). Recently, Bird et al. [32]\ndescribed the related transition from smooth drop boundary to\nsplashing for the more complex case of oblique impact, in a phase\ndiagram with axes deﬁned in terms of only two dimensionless\nimpact numbers. The description of physical transitions with\ndimensionless numbers is typical of ﬂuid dynamics, and allows\none to describe a phenomenon, here the shape transition at the\nedge of drops occurring upon impact, with less variables. This\nreduction of the number of variables thus transforms the\nintractable problem identiﬁed in [4] into a tractable one.\nThe ﬁrst dimensionless number, WenRe1=2\nn\n, can be considered as\na measure of the ratio of inertial forces – which drive the impact,\nover the viscous and surface tension forces – which resist the\nimpact. The second dimensionless number, Vt=Vn\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nRen\np\n, is the ratio\nof the tangential impact velocity over the normal impact velocity,\nscaled by the Reynolds number term. It accounts for the effect of\nangular impact, which typically enhances the tendency to splash at\nthe leading edge of the droplet, and reduces it at its trailing edge.\nIndeed, experiments done for this work, using the blood and target\nmaterial of interest, show that the two dimensionless numbers of\n[32] can be used to associate blood stain shapes with impact\nconditions, as in the phase diagram of Fig. 2. That ﬁgure exhibits\ninsets with typical stain shapes, and calibration performed in this\nstudy (described in Supplementary documentation) identiﬁed the\nlimits between the three stain peripheral shapes with red and\ngreen lines. Above the red line, inertia dominates the resisting\nforces, and stains exhibit splashing in the form of smaller satellite\nspatter stains surrounding the leading edge of the main stain, as\nshown in the insets. Below the green line, inertia is lowest with\nrespect to resisting forces, and stains exhibit a smooth boundary,\nsymmetrical across their main axis. Between the red and the green\nline, stains exhibit wavy, asymmetric deformations of their\nboundaries. Note that a typical calibration process such as the\none performed in this study for smooth cardstock can be done for\nother surfaces of interest to crime scene reconstruction. The\ncalibration process provides both the phase diagram in Fig. 2 and\nthe spreading Correlation (4) for a speciﬁc target surface.\nFor the model presented in this manuscript, the phase diagram of\nFig. 2 is used to narrow down the range of acceptable trial values of β.\nTrial impact conditions that correspond to a stain periphery shape\ndifferent from that observed on the stain of interest are discarded.\nEffectively, consideration of this criterion linking the morphology of\nstain boundary with impact conditions reduces the range of impact\nconditions to be used in trial trajectory calculations.\n2.2.2. Probabilistic modeling\nThe probabilistic determination of the region of origin is\nbased on the principle of maximum likelihood [33], which\nidentiﬁes the region of origin around a point of highest\nprobability given our assumptions. The likelihood function is\nthen used to produce the region of origin as a conﬁdence\nvolume around that point with varying levels of probability.\nFig. 3 describes the method graphically, where the likely region\nof convergence is ﬁrst determined in the probabilistic manner\nof [10], and then the likely height above the region of\nconvergence is estimated. To ﬁrst determine the region of\nconvergence, the horizontal plane is discretized along its x–y\northonormal directions with an array of points k, as in Fig. 3. A\nprobability density function (PDF) cik expresses the probability\ndensity that the x–y projection of a trajectory from stain i passes\nthrough point k.

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

When a positive context was presented, ana-\nlysts were less likely to make an incorrect classification than\nwhen the context was neutral, with the overall error rate drop-\nping from 11% to 8%. Conversely, when a negative context was\npresented analysts were more likely to make an incorrect classi-\nfication than when the context was neutral, with the overall error\nrate increasing to 20%. The rate of inconclusive decisions was\nhighest when the contextual information contained no directional\ncues (21%), relative to when there were positively (15%) or neg-\natively biasing cues (16%).\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of clas-\nsification decisions in bloodstain pattern analysis. To do this,\nwell-trained and highly experienced analysts examined over 400\nspatter patterns on rigid non-absorbent surfaces, representing sur-\nfaces frequently encountered at crime scenes. Four spatter pattern\ntypes commonly encountered in crime scene investigations were\nused. The extent of available pattern, the nature of the substrate,\nand the type of contextual information were varied in a balanced\nexperiment designed to determine the effect of these variables\non pattern classification accuracy.\nAnalysts were required to classify the pattern to a standard\nrequired for court. To do this, analysts were allowed to select\none or more pattern classifications that they determined could\nnot be excluded. Within the chosen range of conditions, the\n17.4% overall rate of inconclusive decisions gives some measure\nof interpretation difficulty for the patterns created in this study.\nWhere a classification was made, either by choosing a single\npattern or by nominating more than one pattern, 13.1% of these\nclassifications did not include the correct pattern type. This find-\ning can be considered the first approximation of an overall error\nrate for bloodstain pattern classification on rigid non-absorbent\nsurfaces.\nSome patterns were more reliably classified than others. In\nparticular, the error rate was 4% for expirated patterns compared\nwith 19% for impact patterns. The characteristic features of expi-\nrated patterns (e.g., mucus strands and air bubbles) were gener-\nally evident within these patterns, which could explain why this\npattern type was the most recognizable. The second most recog-\nnizable pattern type was cast-off spatter. Many of the distinctive\nfeatures of a cast-off pattern, such as a linear or curvilinear dis-\ntribution of stains, were also generally present in the cast-off pat-\nterns prepared in this study.\nOther than a lack of distinctive features in a pattern, it is not\nclear why the proportion of incorrect classifications for impact\nand firearms-related spatter patterns was higher. It is possible\nthat the features that were observed in these patterns were those\nshared by other pattern types. For example, many of the impact\npatterns had a somewhat narrow distribution of stains, similar to\ncast-off. Indeed, on closer observation of the data, many of the\nimpact patterns were incorrectly classified as cast-off. Firearms-\nrelated spatter patterns in this study did not always have a large\nproportion of the very small “mist” stains usually associated with\nthis pattern type, which may explain why firearms related spatter\nwas excluded as a mechanism for some of these patterns.\nLooking more closely at the other variables used in this study,\nit is evident that where the amount of available pattern was lim-\nited or the substrate made stain visualization more difficult (e.g.,\nchipboard)\nthe\nproportion\nof\ncorrectly\nclassified\npatterns\ndecreased. However, the reduction in classification accuracy was\ngenerally accompanied by an increase in the proportion of incon-\nclusive responses. So where the pattern was more difficult to\nrecognize, analysts became more conservative in their judgment,\nwhich is what is to be expected from a reliable method.\nThe error rates estimated from this study are based, in part, on\nthe conditions chosen for examination. These conditions were\ndesigned to be a fair representation of real casework but remain\nthe subjective judgement of the experimenters. In particular, the\npatterns used in the study were restricted to common spatter\ntypes. Had other more easily recognized pattern types, such as\ndrip stains, drip patterns, transferred blood, and saturation pat-\nterns been included, the proportion of correct classifications may\nhave been higher. In addition, the size of the targets meant that\nin many cases the analysts received only a portion of the total\npattern. As well as reducing the number of bloodstains available\nfor analysis, the limited pattern size meant that it may not have\nbeen possible to perform other analyses such as area of origin\ndeterminations. Even with a small number of stains and only a\nportion of the complete pattern available, however, many ana-\nlysts were prepared to make a classification. Finally, the use of a\ncoating of lacquer removed the potential to perform any chemi-\ncal tests on the bloodstains, which may have hindered analysts’\nability to confirm, for example, the presence of saliva to indicate\nexpirated blood. It is worth noting that some of these limitations\nexist in casework, especially where analysts are working solely\nfrom photographs. While any of these limitations could have\nreduced the classification success rate, none would be expected\nto increase erroneous classifications, because such errors mean\nthe correct pattern type has been excluded. Rather, an increase in\ninconclusive classifications\nwould be\nexpected, which was\nFIG. 4––Proportion of response outcomes as a function of direction of\ncontextual cues.\nFIG. 3––Proportion of response outcomes as a function of target sub-\nstrate.\n926\nJOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES\n 15564029, 2016, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.13091 by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

Each analyst received 15 or 16 targets,\nand a response sheet associated with each target. A number was\nplaced at the top of each target; this identified which target cor-\nresponded to each response sheet and indicated the pattern align-\nment during pattern construction. No two analysts received the\nsame targets.\nEach of the manipulated variables was counterbalanced across\nthe other variables and across the entire sample.\nThe response sheet included the following instructions: “You\nare preparing your final report for investigators, which could\nend up being presented in court. Please give your opinion as to\nthe pattern type or types that could account for the stains on the\nsample target.”\nA list of pattern types, along with SWGSTAIN definitions,\nwas provided as follows: cast-off, drip trail, impact, saturation,\nsplash, transfer, drip, expiration, pool, spatter from gunshot\ntrauma (forward or back spatter), swipe, insect stain, drip stain,\nflow, projected (e.g., arterial), and wipe.\nAnalysts could select any number of patterns, or indicate that\n“I can’t state that any of the above patterns would account for\nthe stains on the sample target.”\nAfter classifying all target patterns, analysts emailed or posted\ntheir responses to the independent third-party.\nResults\nError and Accuracy Rate Determination\nAnalysts’ responses were considered correct if they selected\nthe pattern type that represented the true mechanistic cause for\npattern (or selected this pattern type among multiple selections).\nAnalysts’ responses were considered incorrect if the true pattern\ntype was not selected in their choice(s). If analysts could not state\nthat any of the listed patterns could account for the target pattern,\ntheir responses were considered inconclusive. If analysts had clas-\nsified the pattern by indicating all listed types as possible, these\nresponses would have been considered inconclusive; none did so.\nPattern Classification Accuracy\nTwenty-seven analysts made judgements on 15–16 target pat-\nterns each, yielding 416 unique assessments. Three assessments\nwere removed from the analysis because no response was provided;\n413 responses remained. In total, analysts were correct for 69.5%\nof classifications and made errors for 13.1% of classifications. The\nremaining 17.4% of responses were inconclusive. Chi-squared (v2)\ntests were performed to determine whether the frequency of correct,\nincorrect,\nand\ninconclusive\nresponses\nvaried\nsignificantly\n(p < 0.05) as a function of each of the variables under examination.\nEffect of Pattern Type\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of ana-\nlysts’ correct, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\npattern type, v2 (6, N = 413) = 13.871, p = 0.031. This was\nmainly due to analysts’ success in identifying expirated patterns\n(81% correct compared to 64–69% for the remaining types; Fig. 1).\nEffect of Pattern Extent\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of\ncorrect, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\npattern extent, v2 (4, N = 413) = 26.74, p < 0.0001. As might\nbe expected, analysts’ accuracy improved as the extent of blood-\nstaining in the pattern (essentially the number of stains present\non the target) increased (Fig. 2). Rather than the decrease in\nstaining extent increasing analysts’ propensity to make errors,\nthe decrease in correct classifications was matched with an\nincrease in inconclusive classifications.\nEffect of Target Substrate\nThere was a significant overall difference in the frequency of\ncorrect, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\nthe substrate on which the bloodstain patterns were deposited, v2\n(4, N = 413) = 38.64, p < 0.0001. Analysts made the greatest\nnumber of correct classifications on the white-painted surface,\nfollowed by the wallpaper surface (Fig. 3). The chipboard sur-\nface resulted in the lowest proportion of correct responses and\ngreatest proportion of inconclusive responses. The chipboard sur-\nface had a highly patterned finish with many surface features\nthat could have been confused with small bloodstains. Analysts\nhad little or no scope for using any enhancement methods that\nmight have assisted them with distinguishing bloodstains from\nartefacts.\nAnalysts’\ndecrease\nin\ncorrect\nclassifications\nwas\nmatched by an increase in inconclusive classifications, rather\nthan an increase in erroneous classifications.\nEffect of Contextual Information\nThere was a significant overall difference in the number of\ncorrect, incorrect, and inconclusive responses as a function of\nthe direction of the contextual cues, v2 (4, N = 413) = 12.39,\nFIG. 1––Proportion of response outcomes as a function of pattern type.\nFIG. 2––Proportion of response outcomes as a function of pattern extent.\nTAYLOR ET AL. .

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

Overall, the stain sizes\nand shapes do not appear to substantially change during the drying\nprocess. An exception occurs on the ﬁngerprint-coated glass, as\nthere appears to be a stick-slip dynamic between the images taken\nat 30 and 60 min. Speciﬁcally, the contact line for this drop\nsuddenly retracts as the drop dries, leaving behind a faint ring of\ndried blood (Fig. 6, second row).\nThe drying dynamics on the clean glass is similar to what has\nbeen previously documented [38]. Within 10 min of being on the\nsurface, the drop changes color as it solidiﬁes and appears to form a\nthicker rim region. Within 30 min, the drop has completely dried,\nand cracks have formed along the rim. On the coated surfaces, the\ndrop takes longer to completely dry, perhaps because it is thicker,\nas indicated by the darker color when backlit (Fig. 6).\nTaken together, the short and long-time dynamics indicate\nthat \nstain \nsize \non \nthese \nmicroscopic \ncoatings \n(Fig. \n4) \nis\npredominantly set within the ﬁrst tenth of a second.

Fig. 7a plots this contact radius,\nnormalized by the initial drop radius, for the drops illustrated in\nFig. 5. Note that during the spreading phase, the dynamics are\nindistinguishable and the differences in the stain size appear to\nbe related to the speed at which the extended droplet retracts. The\nﬁnal spreading factor β is also included for comparison. The\nretraction speed and timescale are consistent with a mechanism in\nwhich the contact lines recede to lower the surface energy while\nbeing resisted by the liquid inertia [39,40]. This mechanism\nindicates that the contact angle u of the coating is likely an\nimportant parameter when predicting the ﬁnal stain size. Recall\nFig. 6. Time series of the drying process for the blood drops depicted in Fig. 5. All drops were in their ﬁnal conﬁguration after 2 h.

The scalebar of 5 mm applies to all images.\nFig. 7. Plot of the contact radius r(t) and ﬁnal spreading factor β for the blood\ndrops depicted in Figs. 5 and 6 .

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

First, how does the disparity in stained\nleft versus right loop legs vary with height asymmetry? Here we\nexamined only two fabrics, so a more comprehensive survey of\nmany fabric types would be helpful to develop a quantitative\ncorrelation. Second, we performed the contact transfer as soon as\npossible after spraying the blood onto the donor surface (glass or\nleather), but if the blood is left to evaporate for some time then its\nphysical properties (e.g., viscosity and interfacial tension) will\nchange. ‘‘Drier’’ blood will likely also yield discrepancy between\nstained left and right loop legs, but quantitative corroboration is\nnecessary. Third, we performed all contact transfer in this study\nsimply by pressing the fabric onto the donor surface by hand, using\n(to the best of our ability) the same applied force each time. Given\nour proposed mechanism, a possibility worth investigating is that\nthe pressure exerted during the contact transfer could alter the\nmicroscopic distribution of stained loop legs. For example one\npossible hypothesis is that a low application of force (i.e., a ‘light\npush’) yields a higher discrepancy between left and right loop legs\nbecause the recessed legs fail to reach the drops, whereas a high\napplication of force (i.e., a ‘heavy push’) minimizes the discrepancy\nby bringing the recessed loop legs in closer contact with the drops.\nLikewise, this study restricted attention to contact transfer\nperformed by applying pressure to the fabric normally (orthogo-\nnally) to the donor surface; the effect of shearing motions (i.e.,\n‘brushing or swiping’) tangential to the donor surface remain to be\nexamined. The present study will serve as a framework to address\nthese more complicated questions, and help put bloodstain pattern\nanalysis on a more quantitative footing.\nAcknowledgments\nSupport for this research was provided by the National Institute\nof Justice (Award No. 2010-DN-BX-K039).

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

BT distance affects spatter\npatterns as the number of stains of a spatter pattern becomes smal-\nler with increasing BT distance, as more drops are deflected by the\neffect of gravity and drag with increasing BT distance.\nIn this paper, we define the atomization mechanism as the speci-\nfic cause of a bloodstain pattern, using the labels handgun, rifle,\ncylinder, or hockey puck. We also define the atomization process\nas the general cause of a bloodstain pattern, using the labels gun-\nshot or blunt impact. In order to explore the interaction between\nBT distance and the mechanism, we generate bloodstains spatter\npatterns at different BT distances. The data used in the main paper\nare 94 spatter patterns (excluding muzzle gases) with BT distance\nno larger than 120 cm. The number of replicate experiments under\neach BT distance and the mechanism is shown in Table 1a.\nThere is a wealth of possible ways to create impact or\nbackspatter patterns. A gunshot to a hairy head will give a dif-\nferent spatter pattern than a gunshot on a naked leg. The design\nof realistic blunt impact and gunshot experiments is still an\nopen research issue. As mentioned in Ref. (23), there is still no\nconsensus on which experimental setup is best to simulate the\ncomplexity of gunshot spatter patterns in realistic conditions,\nwhere blood is located within a complex structure involving\nbody tissues and blood vessels, covered by skin, clothes, or\nhair. Head of calves (29), a human cadaver filled with blood\n(30), foams or sponges soaked in blood (11,26), or cavities\nfilled with blood (14) have been used. Experiments reported in\nthis study used both soaked foams and cavities filled with\nblood as the blood source, and the information on which blood\nsource was used is specified. Certainly, there is a need for\nresearch to produce more realistic models of blood containers\nfor gunshot experiments. We believe, however, that research on\nclassification of blood spatter patterns should not wait until\nsuch an elusive model is developed. Furthermore, the models\nused\nin\nthis\nstudy\nfor\nimpact\nand\nfor\ngunshot\nproduce\nrepeatable results and have allowed a wealth of scientific find-\nings of interest to BPA (14,15,28).\nImage Processing\nThe image analysis is processed using available routines of\nthe commercial software MATLAB\u0001 (20). After image segmen-\ntation, we apply the image analysis tool regionprops to analyze\nthe identified spots (called connected components) in spatter pat-\nterns. Not all the components are spatter bloodstains, with a\ncharacteristic approximate elliptical shape; some undesired com-\nponents are pencil marks or overlapping bloodstains that are cur-\nrently too complex to use for reconstruction. We apply the\nfollowing criteria to eliminate the undesired components: (i) dis-\ncard components with area smaller than 0.021 mm2 (3.4 9 3.4\npixels in scanner resolution); (ii) discard components with a\nsolidity smaller than 0.75, in which solidity is a measure of the\ndensity of the pixels within a given component as defined in re-\ngionprops; (iii) discard components with impact angle approxi-\nmated from a fitted ellipse (arcsine of the ratio of the minor axis\ndivided by the major axis of fitted ellipse) smaller than p/18\nbecause the component has a high probability to be a linear\nmark such as pencil mark or cardstock fold; and (iv) discard\ncomponents with a ratio of Area over FilledArea smaller than\n0.95, in which Area and FilledArea are defined in regionprops.\nThe last criterion was found effective at removing the obvious\noverlapping bloodstains. It is important to note that every image\nprocessing method comes with their own choices, which are\nbased on a trial-and-error process focused (in our case) at sepa-\nrating the stains of interest from other marks and from overlap-\nping stains. However, the above choices have been applied\nconsistently throughout the present study.\nGlobal Features\nHere, we describe the features that were engineered to\ndescribe the spatter patterns.

    "text_chunk": "3. Theoretical reconstruction of cast-off patterns\n3.1. Geometric reconstruction of segments of the weapon swing\nThe proposed reconstruction method is based on the fact that\ndrops leave the weapon tangentially to its trajectory and on the\nassumptions that (1) the trajectories of the drops are linear, along a\nline that contains the stain of interest, with slope estimated from\nstain inspection and (2) that the weapon follows a circular\ntrajectory, at least over small displacements (piecewise circular\nswing).\nUnder these two assumptions, each circular piece of the swing\ncan be reconstructed as in Fig. 3. To do so, we use a geometrical\nproperty of triangles adjacent to a circle, as in Proposition 4 of book\nIV of the Elements by Euclid. Euclid lived in the third century before\nthe Common Era and is considered the founder of geometry. To the\nbest of our knowledge, he did not produce any work on forensics,\nunlike his younger contemporary Archimedes who is credited with\nuncovering commercial fraud by applying the buoyancy laws [27]\nthat he discovered. In the application of Euclidean geometry\nproposed here, the green circle describes the trajectory of the\nweapon, and the adjacent triangle ðA; B; CÞ is formed by inter-\nsections of the trajectories of three blood drops, reconstructed\nfrom stains M, L, N. In his proposition x127, Lachlan [28] shows that\nEuclid’s work implies that “The internal bisector of the angle BAC,\nand the external bisectors of the angles ABC, ACB, are concurrent.\nLet the point in which they meet be denoted by I1. This point is the\ncentre of a circle which can be drawn to touch the sides of the\ntriangle, but it is on the side of BC remote to A. This circle is called\nan escribed circle [ . . . ] L1, M1, N1 be the points of contact of the\nsides with this circle”.\nIn the forensic reconstruction task at hand, the escribed circle\nproposition is valid for any set of three stains where trajectories of\nthe associated drops are not parallel, such as the set labelled M, L, N\nin Fig. 3. Using this proposition, triplets of three adjacent stains will\ntypically determine an escribed circle along which the swinging\nweapon is most likely to have travelled. More precisely, the arc\nshown in magenta in Fig. 3 connects the three points of contact of\nthe stain trajectories with the escribed circle, and best approx-\nimates the likely reconstructed weapon swing. Then, the various\narcs produced by various triplets of stains are combined in the\nprobabilistic manner described below, so that circular and non-\ncircular curves of swinging weapon can be reconstructed.\n3.2. Probabilistic reconstruction of the weapon swing\nThe geometric reconstruction approach above produces multi-\nple segments in the form of arcs. A probabilistic approach has been\ndeveloped to achieve two tasks: adding a speciﬁc thickness to the\nreconstructed arcs based on the propagation of measurement\nuncertainties \n(the \nthickness \nbeing \na \nrepresentation \nof \nthe\nuncertainty in determining the swing motion) and merging the\narcs obtained from all the reconstructed triplets/triplets of stains\ninto a volume that reconstructs most of the swing of the weapon.\nEach reconstructed arc has the appearance, visually and culinary\nspeaking, of a noodle. The centerline of the noodle describes the\nmost likely arc associated with a triplet of stain, and the thickness\nof the noodle, the associated uncertainty. The volume merged from\nall the arcs may assume any shape based on the probabilistic union\nof multiple arcs with given thickness.\nBased on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation, the\nuncertainty of the reconstructed arc is expressed probabilistically,\nin a manner analogous to what Camana [12] and Attinger et al. [18]\nhave done for impact spatter patterns (the simpler situation where\nthe blood source is assumed to be immobile). In the present case,\nwe assume that the uncertainty of any measurement relevant to\nthe reconstruction process can be expressed as a probability\ndensity function (PDF), Eq. (1), where m is the mean of the\nmeasurement, sk is the standard deviation, and x is a continuous\nrandom variable, such as an angle or a distance:\nck x\nð Þ ¼\n1\nsk\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n2p\np\ne\n\u00051\n2\nx\u0005m\nsk\n\u0003 \n\u00042\nð1Þ\nThe space considered in the analysis is the room containing the\nblood spatter pattern. It is discretized with a Cartesian grid into\nuniform cubic regions. As shown in Fig. 4, the relative position of\nany given spatial region is expressed with respect to the\nreconstructed arc using the radial distance Djn between the\ncenter of a cube j and reconstructed cast-off arc n. In these symbols,\nindex j represents a given region in space, and index n refers to the\ncast-off arc segment reconstructed from the n-th triplet of stains as\nper method in Fig. 3. The radial distance is used as the continuous\nvariable in Eq. (1) to estimate the relative likelihood that any given\ndiscretized region contains the reconstructed cast-off segment.\nThe probability that a given point in space is associated with a\ncast-off arc reconstructed from an arbitrary set of three stains can\nbe quantiﬁed with the PDF\ncjn ¼\n1\nSFjn \u0006\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n2p\np\ne\n\u00051\n2\nDjn\nSFjn\n\u0003 \n\u00042\nð2Þ\nAs shown in Fig. 5, this PDF is maximum for Djn ¼ 0, which\ngives \nmost \nweight \nto \nspatial \nregions \ncoincident \nwith \nthe\nreconstructed arc. By deﬁnition of a normal distribution, the term\nSFjn, in cm, is a spreading parameter that controls the shape of the\ndistribution. Small spreading values correspond to very local\ndistributions, while larger spreading values spread the distribution\nover larger distances. To deﬁne the spreading value, we postulate\nthat it depends on three independents quantities, graphically\nrepresented in the inset of Fig. 5.

It is expected that function f in\nEq. (3) increases monotonically with the increase of each of the\nthree variables a ; ’ ;Dwall. Indeed, a reconstructed arc will be\nknown more accurately if there is little angular uncertainty in the\nrelated drop impact; if the directionalities of the stains align in the\nFig. 3.

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Barni et al. / Talanta 72 (2007) 896–913\nΦCL is the product of three factors: the fraction of excited states\nproduced, ΦEX; the fraction of reacting molecules following\nthe correct chemical path, ΦR; and the ﬂuorescence quantum\nyield of the emitter, ΦF:\nΦCL = ΦEXΦRΦF\nChemiluminescence quantum yields vary widely from 10−15 to\nnearly 1, however most of the reactions used in analysis fall in the\nrange 0.01–0.1 [6]. The use of very sensitive detectors and the\nalmost complete absence of background emission has allowed\nthe monitoring of even inefﬁcient chemiluminescence reactions\nwith quantum efﬁciencies less than 0.001, such as the oxidative\nultra-weak chemiluminescent reactions in living cells [7].\nThe quantum efﬁciency and colour of a chemiluminescence\nemission are greatly affected by the environment in which the\nreaction takes place. For solution phase chemiluminescence the\nfactors that will affect the reaction are similar to those affect-\ning normal ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence. For example,\nthe chemiluminescence quantum yield and colour of emission\nfor luminol in dimethylsulfoxide and water are 0.05, blue-\ngreen (λmax ∼480–502 nm) and 0.01, blue-violet to blue-green\n(λmax ∼425 nm), respectively [8,9].\nFor most analytical purposes it is the chemiluminescence\nemission intensity (ICL) that is measured, either as an integral\nover the lifetime of the emission or as a transient response. It is\na function of both the efﬁciency and the rate of the reaction:\nICL = ΦCL\n\u0002dC\ndt\n\u0003\nwhere dC/dt is the rate of reaction (molecules reacting s−1).\nChemiluminescence reactions can occur very rapidly (<1 s) or\nextremely slowly (>1 day), according to the reaction and the\nconditions.\n1.2. Luminol historical background\nSome of the key events in the discovery, study, and use of\nluminol are shown in Fig. 2. Even though there is some debate\nas to the ﬁrst report of the synthesis of luminol [10,11], the Ger-\nman scientist Schmitz has often been suggested as the ﬁrst to\nhave produced this compound in 1908 [12,13]. Regardless of\nthis controversy, it is now widely accepted that Albrecht was the\nﬁrst to report its involvement in chemiluminescence reactions\nin 1928 [14] (Fig. 2). Specht, a forensic scientist at the Univer-\nsity Institute for Legal Medicine and Scientiﬁc Criminalistics\nof Jena, Germany, ﬁrst studied in depth the role of hemin, an\niron-containing compound derived from heme, in the chemical\nreaction involving luminol and investigated its potential appli-\ncation in blood detection [15]. This represented the ﬁrst use of\nliquid phase chemiluminescence for analytical purposes.\nProesher and Moody [16], investigating both the chemical\nstructure and reaction properties of luminol, correctly pre-\ndicted the keto-enolic tautomerisation of luminol in alkaline\nsolutions and the fully protonated form in acidic solutions.\nThey concluded that chemiluminescence emission intensity\nand duration were increased with dried and decomposed blood,\naged even for 3 years, with respect to fresh blood. They also\nobserved that luminol solution could be sprayed many times\nover bloodstains, particularly if dried, allowing a repetition of\nthe chemiluminescence.\nMcGrath [17] evaluated the speciﬁcity of the luminol test on\nbiological ﬂuids and showed that luminol displayed a speciﬁcity\nfor blood while appearing insensitive to the other biological ﬂu-\nids studied. Nevertheless, when used as presumptive test for\nblood identiﬁcation, he recommended the conﬁrmation of the\nluminol reaction with other more speciﬁc serological tests.\nGrodsky et al. [18] proposed a blend of powders made up\nof luminol, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium perborate\n(NaBO3·nH2O) mixed with distilled water. This subsequently\nbecame the formula that is most commonly used by today’s\ninvestigators to detect traces of blood at the scene of a crime. An\nalternative formulation was proposed by Weber [19] of luminol,\nsodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and hydrogen per-\noxide diluted in distilled water. The solution so obtained needed\nto be kept in a cool place away from direct light and showed a\nbrief lifespan.\nSince these early studies in luminol, there have been sev-\neral other attempts to elucidate the reaction mechanism, with\na major effort by Mer´enyi and co-workers in the 1980s culmi-\nnating in a summary paper in 1990 [20].

At 70 % of the total evaporation time, the central\narea of the drop starts to completely desiccate and evidences small-sized pattern\nformation. This last stage of the process is characterized by a sharp decrease of\nthe evaporation mass ﬂux, since the remaining water is that which is inside the\nRBCs. Finally, after 85 % of the total evaporation time, the RBCs which are just\nshells containing the haemoglobin, crack and free the remaining liquid which can\nevaporate. This leads to a typical cross-section deposit which can also be called a\n‘donut’ shape.\nThe drying process behaviour based on the evaporation mass ﬂow rate is not\nmodiﬁed by the drop diameter as presented in ﬁgure 5.

Here, we explored accuracy and contextual inﬂuence in bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation,\nand how these variables might relate to analyst characteristics. Thirty-nine bloodstain pattern analysts with vary-\ning degrees of experience each completed measures of compliance, decision-making style, and need for closure.\nAnalysts then examined a bloodstain pattern without any additional contextual information, and allocated votes\nto listed pattern types according to favoured and less favoured classiﬁcations. Next, if they believed it would assist\nwith their classiﬁcation, analysts could request items of contextual information – from commonly encountered\nsources of information in bloodstain pattern analysis – and update their vote allocation. We calculated a shift\nscore for each item of contextual information based on vote reallocation. Almost all forms of contextual informa-\ntion inﬂuenced decision-making, with medical ﬁndings leading to the highest shift scores. Although there was a\nsmall positive association between shift scores and the degree to which analysts displayed an intuitive decision-\nmaking style, shift scores did not vary meaningfully as a function of experience or the other characteristics\nmeasured.

Introduction\nForensic science is currently at a crossroads. The reliability of conclu-\nsions about forensic evidence, and the methods used to reach those con-\nclusions, are ﬁrmly under the microscope. This juncture is largely due to\nthe much talked about National Research Council (NRC) report [1] into\nthe state of forensic science. This report highlighted the need for known\nerror rates in forensic science, and recommended that forensic disci-\nplines acknowledge the role of the examiner in the interpretation pro-\ncess. In particular, the report recognised the need for research into the\neffect of contextual information on the interpretation process [1]. Con-\ntext effects in forensic science are commonly referred to as contextual\nbias—a term that typically describes the unconscious inﬂuence of irrel-\nevant information on judgements.\nPrior to the publication of the NRC report [1], research into the\nperformance of forensic experts was sparse and had primarily focussed\non ﬁngerprint evidence [2,3]. This research highlighted a high degree of\nsubjectivity in ﬁngerprint interpretation, showing that ﬁngerprint\ndecisions are vulnerable to bias. Now, many other forensic disciplines\nhave faced the same scrutiny, with investigations into contextual bias\nbeing carried out in forensic odontology [4,5], handwriting examination\n[6], forensic anthropology [7], shoeprint examination [8], bullet com-\nparison [9], DNA interpretation [10], and bloodstain pattern analysis\n[11,12]. The general consensus from this research is that forensic inter-\npretations are vulnerable to contextual bias—a ﬁnding that is not sur-\nprising to psychological scientists, who have long investigated these\nbasic human decision-making processes [e.g.,13,14].\nIn response to this growing body of literature, forensic laboratories\naround the world are developing ways to minimise the potential for\ncontextual bias [6,15,16]. In Australia, for example, the Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department has introduced a system of contextual\ninformation management for handwriting examinations [6]. Here, a\ndesignated context manager removes all irrelevant contextual details\nbefore passing the document on to be examined. Consequently, there\nis minimal chance for irrelevant contextual details to cloud judgement.\nImplementing this type of bias-minimising procedure would also be\nrelatively uncomplicated for many other forensic disciplines, such as\nﬁngerprint interpretation, shoeprint examination, and DNA interpreta-\ntion. The interpretation of such evidence requires minimal to no\nadditional contextual information, and most or all contextual details\ncan be removed.\nNot all forensic disciplines, however, are presented with such a\nstraightforward solution to eliminating the negative effects of context.\nScience and Justice 56 (2016) 123–128\n⁎ Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: nosborne@psy.otago.ac.nz (N.K.P.

The videos used in this analysis were focused on a variety of\ntargets hit by a bullet which caused either forward, backward, or both types of blood spatter. The analysis\nprocess utilized particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle analysis software to measure drop\nvelocities as well as the distributions of the number of droplets and their respective side view area. The\nresults of this analysis revealed that the maximal velocity in the forward spatter can be about 47 \u0001 5 m/s\nand for the backward spatter – about 24 \u0001 8 m/s. Moreover, our measurements indicate that the number\nof droplets produced is larger in forward spatter than it is in backward spatter. In the forward and\nbackward spatter the droplet area in the side-view images is approximately the same. The upper angles of\nthe close-to-cone domain in which droplets are issued in forward and backward spatter are, 27 \u0001 9\u0003 and\n57 \u0001 7\u0003, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-cone domain are 28 \u0001 12\u0003 and 30 \u0001 18\u0003,\nrespectively. The inclination angle of the bullet as it penetrates the target is seen to play a large role in the\ndirectional preference of the spattered blood. Also, muzzle gases, bullet impact angle, as well as the\naerodynamic wake of the bullet are seen to greatly inﬂuence the ﬂight of the droplets. The intent of this\ninvestigation is to provide a quantitative basis for current and future research on bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) of either forward or backward blood spatter due to a gunshot.\nPublished by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\n1.

The set of videos includes blood\nspatter formation due to a gunshot, blood spatter due to a blunt\nobject such as a hammer, or blood drop formation from a single\ndroplet and is located on the MFRC website [1]. In literature, the\nvideos have been referred to before [3–5], and are routinely used in\nbloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) presentation and training classes.\nHowever, a quantitative analysis of this dataset is still unavailable,\nespecially for the scenario of blood spatter due to a gunshot.\nAccordingly, the aim of the present work is in quantitative analysis\nof blood spatter induced by a gunshot to facilitate the BPA\ncommunity tools for scientiﬁc analysis of a crime scene event.\nBlood is a complex non-Newtonian ﬂuid which is shear-\nthinning [6–8], exhibits viscoelastic behavior [8–11] and possesses\na yield stress [12]. It is an aqueous suspension which contains\nplasma and particles such as white and red blood cells, and\nplatelets. Blood starts to coagulate when it leaves the body or\nunder conditions of increased shear stress [13]. The rheology of\nblood could affect the atomization process [14–16] which is of\nfundamental importance for BPA because it determines the\ndistribution of drop sizes and velocities [17], thus the resulting\nblood spatter. The atomization is diminished by the effects of\nviscoelasticity [18–20], and the resulting size of the impacting\ndroplets can be heavily inﬂuenced by viscosity and elasticity of\nliquid [21–26]. Therefore, an accurate crime scene reconstruction\nfrom any crime involving blood spatter must account for the\nrheological behavior of blood.\nThe uncertainties of different BPA techniques can be signiﬁcant,\nup to a 50% overestimation of the height of the origin of a blood\nspatter [5]. A better understanding of the mechanisms of\nblood droplet formation and ﬂight is required. The ﬁrst theoretical\nsteps in this direction are already available [27].

Because glass is\ncompletely wetted by all evaluated liquids, the critical surface\ntension of glass is higher than 71.99 mN/m.

For pure\nwater droplets, no splashing was observed within the velocity\nrange investigated here (0.1 < v < 4.7 m/s).

Traditional methods of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) rely significantly on the \nexpertise of professional examiners, which can result in limitations including low identification efficiency, high \nmisjudgment rates, and susceptibility to external disturbances. To enhance the accuracy and scientific rigor of \nidentifying impact spatters and fly spots, this study employed artificial intelligence techniques in image recog­\nnition and transfer learning. Two types of bloodstains obtained from simulation experiments were utilized as \ndatasets, and a pre-trained neural network, ResNet-18, was employed for feature extraction. The original fully \nconnected layer was replaced, and a new fully connected layer with a dimensionality of 2 was introduced to fulfil \nthe task requirements. The results demonstrate that the transfer learning network model, based on ResNet-18, \nachieved a maximum accuracy of 93 % in morphologically identifying impact spatters and fly spots. The \nobjective is to assist crime scene investigators and BPA analysts to identify bloodstains at homicide scenes \nconveniently, rapidly and accurately, thereby furnishing scientific evidence for scene reconstruction and \nadvancing BPA toward intelligent practices.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) employs a multi-disciplinary \napproach to discern the nature of activities and mechanisms behind \nbloodstains. BPA draws upon principles from biology, physics, and \nmathematics to scrutinise and analyze the size, shape, and distribution \nof bloodstains [1]. This approach has been demonstrated to be an \neffective tool in the investigation of crime scenes, offering vital clues and \nrobust support for crime scene reconstruction and aiding in case \ndetection during legal proceedings.\nSpatter stains are among the most common types of bloodstains \nfound at violent crime scenes [2]. These stains frequently form at the \nprimary crime scene and include subtypes such as spurt, cast-off, and \nimpact spatter [2]. Impact spatter is a type of bloodstain pattern formed \nby the impact of objects moving at different speeds on blood-stained or \nblood-containing objects, resulting in blood droplets splattering radially \nin all directions, which is of great significance for bloodstain analysts to \nanalyze the specific process of the occurrence of the case [3]. These \nbloodstains are typically circular or elliptical in shape, and their diam­\neter size is inversely proportional to the force of impact, ranging from \n0.01 mm to over 4 mm in diameter [1,3].\nIn certain homicide scenarios, when an assailant repeatedly strikes \nthe victim’s head with a blunt object near a wall, blood droplets may \nsplatter perpendicularly onto the wall, creating overlapping impact \nspatters [2]. The morphology of these overlapping impact spatters, \nresulting from multiple impacts, closely resembles the fly spots formed \nby necrophagous flies regurgitating or defecating onto wall surfaces \nafter licking blood [1,2,4]. On the one hand, fly spots typically have a \ndiameter of 1–2 mm, and exhibit a wide variety of shapes including \ncircular, elliptical, tadpole-like, and teardrop-like shapes [4–6]. These \nstains may occasionally possess a tail ranging from a few millimeters to \nless than 20 millimeters in length [4,5]. On the other hand, fly spots may \ninclude human blood that has not been fully digested, making it difficult \nfor presumptive blood tests such as Hemastix, Sangur, or Luminol, and \nDNA typing to differentiate between fly spots and impact spatter [4]. \nFailure to promptly distinguish between these bloodstain types at a \n* Correspondence to: Criminal Investigation School, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, 301 Baosheng Avenue, Chongqing 401120, China.\nE-mail address: forensicluzhou@hotmail.com (Z.

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

The reason for this is that the timescale of\nimpact phenomena with a bullet is very short, regardless of the\nbullet type.\nFor the initial moments of penetration of a sharp bullet, the\ninitial velocity and acceleration of the blood at the target surface\nare respectively,\nv ¼ u2V0h\nr\n; \nð3Þ\nA ¼ u2V2\n0\nr\n; \nð4Þ\nwhere u is the semi-angle of the bullet generatrix, and h is the\ndepth of bullet penetration which is a function of the time since\nimpact, t. Note that the depth of bullet penetration h can be\npredicted as a function of time t, for example, using Eqs. (17) and\n(18) from Ref. [41].\nEqs. (2) and (4) describe the acceleration of denser blood at the\nfree surface towards lighter air. Such a situation is inherently\nunstable and results in the Rayleigh–Taylor instability [43]. This\ninstability results in the characteristic droplet sizes, l\u0007, issued\nbackward from the free surface, which is given by the following\nexpression,\nl\u0007 ¼\n2p\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nrA=ð3sÞ\np\nw; \nð5Þ\nwhere r is the density of the blood (1060 kg/m3 [16]), s is its\nsurface tension (60.45 mN/m [16]), and w is a dimensionless factor.\nA possible variation of the density and surface tension with\ntemperature is not included in the models discussed here, because\nfor liquids, surface tension variation in a reasonable temperature\ninterval is not large, and, moreover, surface tension s enters Eq. (5)\nas\nﬃﬃﬃs\np , which minimizes the effect of temperature even further. The\ndensity variation with temperature is practically insigniﬁcant.\nThe Rayleigh–Taylor instability links the ﬂow ﬁeld of blood in\nthe target splashed backward by a gunshot to the generation of\nindividual droplets, a link which common BPA techniques such as\nthe method of strings, do not contain. This makes the aforemen-\ntioned models [41,42] physical in nature, i.e. linking the blood\nspatter pattern to the bullet shape and the gunshot parameters.\nNote also that in Ref. [42], the spray angle of blood droplets from\nthe target with respect to the axis of the bullet was predicted to be\n13\u0001 using the hydrodynamic theory of turbulent submerged jets.\nThe splashed blood droplet trajectories are predicted by models\n[41,42] using momentum balance equations accounting for the\neffects of gravity and air drag affected by droplet-droplet\naerodynamic interactions (the latter being a collective effect).\nThis collective effect stems from the entrainment of air by the\nleading droplets, the aerodynamic wake of which diminishes air\ndrag on the subsequent droplets and can even accelerate them, as\nshown in Ref. [52] and highlighted in Fig. 3. This is similar to a ﬂock\nof geese ﬂying in V-formation where the leading goose experiences\nlarger air drag than those behind it and thus essentially pulls the\nothers. Eventually, the leading goose will be switched to a position\nin the back of the formation and this results in a ﬂock which can ﬂy\nfurther [53]. The bullet used to create the velocity history plot of\nFig. 3 closely resembles a sharp one and as such can help further\nvalidate the framework of the models. The range of initial velocities\npredicted with Eq. (3) is superimposed on Fig. 3 and shows that the\ncalculated values are appropriate. Furthermore, the data used in\nFig. 3 allows for an average 2D area to be found from the droplets\nwhich experimentally was 0.084 mm2, whereas assuming a\ncircular area with the diameter calculated in Eq. (5), the theory\npredicts an average droplet area of 0.079 mm2.\nFor the simulation of the backward spatter of blood on a vertical\nwall (cf. Fig. 1), the cardstock target was discretized into 10 even\nrings spanning the minimum and maximum radial distances from\nthe bullet penetration hole. The median distance of each ring from\nthe center of the hole is R. For the number of stains, the stains in\neach ring were added together, for the stain area and impact angle,\nthey were averaged in each ring. Comparisons of the predicted and\nFig. 2.

The error bars represent standard deviation. The velocity is initially increasing\nbecause the continued acceleration of ﬂying droplets due to the pulling effect of the\naerodynamic wake of the leading blood droplets producing a collective effect.

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

The table of contents of two successful textbooks on \nBPA helped to prepare Table 1: the book by MacDonell [41] (and \nthe associated laboratory manual [42]), which—­while dated—­inspired \nthe traditional basic BPA training; and that of a more recent book by \nBevel and Gardner [43], a recommended reading for the BPA certi-\nfication of the International Association for Identification. Table 1 \nlists five general BPA topics with their associated methods, goals, \nand type of evaluative statement. Note that the expressed goals \nare borrowed directly from the above textbooks. However, when \nadopting a LR-­based approach, the purpose is not to \"determine\", \nbut to provide a relative assessment of the probabilities associated \nwith the observations (the effects) given the alleged propositions \n(the causes).\n3.1  |  BPA evaluations of observations are not \nabout source, but about activities\nConsidering that source evaluations are the most current and most \nstraightforward applications of the LR in forensic evaluations, we \ncan readily answer why LR is rarely used in BPA: LR is rarely associ-\nated with BPA evaluations, because these are essentially activity level \nreporting, as shown in the last column of Table 1. Source evaluations \nare not done in BPA: helping to establish the common origin of a \nbloodstain with its source is a fundamental function of forensic \ngenetics but is carried out outside of the traditional scope of BPA. \nThus, the scope of BPA makes it amenable to LR in a more complex \nway than source-­level evaluations, as per Figure 1. This difficulty \nis also present in the interpretation of patterns considering activity \nlevel propositions. Patterns such as footwear or fingerprints have \nrarely been assessed in the light of activity level propositions, most \nof the considerations remained about the source. Assigning LRs for \npatterns considering activity level propositions is an emerging foren-\nsic topic [44–­46].\nBloodstain pattern analysis indeed focuses on helping towards \nquestions of activity, involving either the determination of the \ntransport—­that is, the temporal or spatial evolution—­of blood during \nthe activity (how far, in what direction, and how long ago), or the \ndetermination of the type of activity (the cause of a blood pattern).\nFor instance, BPA analysts are trained at associating patterns \nof millimeter-­sized elliptical stains with broad causes such as spat-\nter events. The “spatter” cause is an abstract category, subsuming \na wide variety of causes such as spitting blood, stepping in a blood \npool, hitting a person with a bullet, and snapping bloody fingers. \nThese spattering events have also completely different character-\nistics (velocity, impulse, and shape of the impactor) than the re-\nsulting distribution of sizes and shapes of the stains in the pattern. \nDetermination of activity based on inspection of stain patterns is \nthus a process where the observations are associated with an ab-\nstract cause, rather than the association of evidence with class char-\nacteristics. Class characteristics associate evidence of the kind of \nblood type, fibers, or paint with a given set of individual sources, as \nbullets with specific marks can be associated with a gun model. The \nrecommendations for courtroom testimony in Ref. [43] mention that \nbloodstain pattern analysis is a “class characteristic” process. This \ndefinition may apply to a small subset of blood patterns called trans-\nfer patterns, which may share characteristics of an object involved \nin the creation of the blood trace, such as the weaves of a cloth or \nthe ridges of a finger. However, for most blood patterns, the associ-\nation of a blood pattern with its cause is not a class characteristics \nprocess, because there is typically little-­to-­no comparable features \nbetween the blood pattern and its cause.\n3.2  |  BPA evaluations rely on a wide range of \nmethods and a complex science base that is still \nbeing built\nClassification of findings with respect to their cause can certainly be \ndone by considering similarities between features of the evidentiary \nobservations and features of known data produced by a given cause. \nThis task is more difficult than classification by similar features be-\ntween questioned and known samples of the same kind, because \nestablishing the database requires the design of experiments pro-\nducing samples based on the set of causes of interest. Firing a model \nof gun (the cause) and collecting the bullets (the findings) might be \na relatively simple example of matching an effect to a cause, in the \nsense that the striations on the bullet might match striation patterns \nof the barrel of the weapon, or match the striations on other bul-\nlets fired by the same model of gun. In BPA, the task of designing \nexperiments corresponding to the specific abstract cause of spat-\nter generation will involve generating events involving, for example, \nsomebody coughing blood, firing bullets, simulating the motion of \nfists, rods hitting blood pools or body parts, at a variety of velocities, \nand along different orientations and directions [47,48]. To be repre-\nsentative of all the possible outcomes of these causes, the param-\neters of the experiments need to be chosen according to a scientific \nknowledge of the associated transport phenomena, so that no sig-\nnificant region of the design parameter space is omitted. This is dif-\nficult to do whether the relationship between cause and effect is not \nwell understood, because of, for example, scientific knowledge gaps \nin the underlying fluid dynamics. In a related way, [36] describes the \npurpose of BPA in contrast to the identification and classification \nproblems presented above. It describes BPA as an attempt to infer \ncauses from observed evidence: “Forensic examiners in disciplines \nlike crime scene investigation, arson, and blood spatter analysis at-\ntempt to reconstruct a crime based on evidence found at the crime \nscene, which can be viewed as attempts to infer the causes of ob-\nserved effects. This can be a challenging task because it is difficult \nto carry out realistic controlled experiments that would allow one to \nreliably distinguish between competing explanations (e.g., fires that \ndevelop naturally versus those using an accelerant). Statistical col-\nlaboration with practitioners in relevant disciplines will be valuable \nin strengthening inferences in these settings.” Similarly, [35] also \nmentions the inherent difficulty in generating statistical data based \non a cause such as “kicking bleeding bodies”: “However, this is not \n 15564029, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.14899 by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁngering of an ink blot or a coffee stain is familiar to everyone. However, despite 140 years\nof study (Worthington 1876), the underlying rapid dynamics of the impact process eluded expla-\nnation until the past 20 years, when high-speed video technology began to allow time-resolved\nobservations of this intriguing phenomenon (Thoroddsen et al. 2008). The increasing pace of sen-\nsor improvements and availability is allowing the study of ever-ﬁner detail and is reinvigorating\nresearch in this area of study, as demonstrated by the large number of very recent references cited\nherein. This imaging technology is now reaching the diffraction limit of spatial resolution and sub-\nmicrosecond interframe times (Li & Thoroddsen 2015, Visser et al. 2015). This is being matched\nby increasing computational power and improved numerical algorithms to allow fully resolved\nsimulations in the axisymmetric conﬁguration (Thoraval et al. 2012), and fully three-dimensional\n(3D) cases, from ﬁrst contact, should soon follow (Agbaglah et al. 2011).\nWe strictly conﬁne our review to impacts on solid surfaces and leave out studies involving\nimpacts on pools or ﬁlms of liquid. Moreover, we emphasize recent works [i.e., appearing after\nthe earlier review by Yarin (2006) in this journal, which dealt with impacts on both solid and\nliquid surfaces].\nStudies of drop impacts are driven by several areas relevant both in nature and in industry.\nIn nature, a drop of water hollows a stone, and splashing produces aerosols, causes erosion, and\nbrings the smell of the earth during rain ( Joung & Buie 2015). In industry, there are spray/wall\ninteractions in coating, cleaning, cooling, and combustion. Inkjet droplets play an increasing role\nin fabrication, from the soldering of electronics to microarrays in biotechnology.\nFigure 1 presents some iconic images of impacting drops, including sketches by Worthington\naround the dawn of photography.

There is a visual difference\nin droplet size and contour when they are fully developed at the\nsyringe tip. Since droplet size inﬂuences stain size, it is important,\nthen that consistency in droplet size is maintained when testing\ncandidate materials in passive dripping simulation.\nThe alcohol removal step when converting GT to LAGT is key to\nincreasing the surface tension of the base sol–gel material, while\nnot signiﬁcantly affecting its viscosity and density. The increase in\ndensity from LAGT to FBS is a result of ﬁller addition.\n3.2.

In the context of bloodstain pattern analysis, a cast-off\nspatter pattern is deﬁned as “a bloodstain pattern resulting from\nblood drops released from an object due to its motion” [1]. Cast-off\nspatters occur when non-gravitational inertial forces overcome the\ncapillary forces retaining blood on an object experiencing linear or\nrotational acceleration. In the latter case, the inertial forces are\ncalled centrifugal forces. Cast-off patterns are characterized with\nlinear or curvilinear stain distributions [2]. Cast-off patterns tend\nto be elongated, as compared to impact spatter that exhibit radial\ndispersions as shown in Fig. 1(a) [3]. Other occurrences of cast-off\nspatters involve water or mud projection by vehicle wheels. The\nscope of this manuscript is focused on spatters relevant to\nbloodstain pattern analysis.\nThe dynamics of cast-off formation have been well documented\n[2,4–9]. Blood adhering by capillary forces on a swinging object\ndetaches when centrifugal forces become large enough to balance\ncapillary forces. The detaching drops leave the swinging object\ntangentially to its swing, with an initial velocity equal in\nmagnitude and direction to that of the weapon at the instant of\ndetachment. The trajectories of the drops are then controlled by\ngravitational and drag forces. They can be described with Newton’s\nsecond law of motion. While several studies have described the\nreconstruction of impact spatter patterns [10–15], where the area\nof origin of the blood is assumed to be static, there is currently no\navailable method to reconstruct the trajectory of the swinging\nobject that generates a cast-off spatter pattern. Current recon-\nstruction methods for impact spatter patterns are called method of\nstrings or tangent method, assume the blood drops travel in straight\ntrajectories from the impacted blood source to the stain impact\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: scott.thomas.mccleary@gmail.com (S.

This study \naimed to investigate the effects of washing temperature, fabric type, fabric color, and stain age (time from \nstaining to laundering) on the detection and identification of bloodstains on fabrics after washing. \nMaterial and method: A total of 240 fabrics (4 different colors and 5 different types) were stained with blood and \nwashed in 4 different washing temperatures with 3 different lag times. The evaluations of fabric images were \nperformed using the FLS system (Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems®) on a total of \n1200 images using 5 different wavelengths and filter options. The bloodstained areas of the fabric pieces were \nthen excised, and the hemoglobin presence was analyzed using the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test. \nResults: The analyses of laundered samples using the FLS system revealed that the best images were obtained \nfrom velvet, cotton fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics, in that order. Except for polyester fabrics, the SERATEC® \nHemDirect hemoglobin screening test, which was used to detect bloodstains on fabrics, showed positive results \nafter washing at low temperatures (approximately 15 ◦C and 30 ◦C). At higher temperatures (60 ◦C and 90 ◦C), \nthe SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test yielded negative results. \nConclusion: The fabric type and color played a crucial role in stain detection using the FLS system on the \nlaundered fabrics. The FLS system and the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test revealed that stain age had a \nlimited effect on the stain’s detectability.   \n1. Introduction \nDetection of biological stains at the crime scene and DNA extraction \nfrom these samples are critical steps in identifying the offender or victim \nof the incident. Bloodstains are among the most common stains found at \ncrime scenes and have a significant forensic value in terms of criminal \njustice.1–3 Bloodstains can often be found on different fabrics, such as \nclothes, sheets, or blankets, belonging to individuals involved in a \nforensic case. The characteristics of fabrics, including thickness, \nweaving pattern, content, and color, affect the formation of blood­\nstains.4 These factors may influence the visibility and detectability of \nbloodstains at the crime scene. \nEven when blood is visible at the crime scene, the visibility of \nbloodstains may need enhancement if it is present in less quantity, not \nclearly visible on the surface, or has been dragged by objects, such as \nshoes.5 In addition, bloodstained clothing or items may be destroyed or \nwashed after a while to hide the crime.1 \nAlthough there are numerous methods for detecting bloodstains, \nespecially in cases where samples are scarce, important evidence such as \nDNA may be compromised by DNA degradation due to destruction of the \nbloodstained samples.5–7 The most commonly observed body fluid at a \ncrime scene is blood.7 Many crimes, ranging from murder to assault, \ninvolve blood.8 Bloodstains can absorb light at wavelength 415 nm.9 The \nForenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems (FLS) \nsystem readily allows visualization of the location of the stains and \ndocumentation as scientific evidence, which can be then presented to \nthe court.10 The FLS system is a nondestructive and noninvasive method \nbased on the absorptive and photoluminescent properties of the bio­\nlogical stains.10,11 As it permits rapid scanning of large surfaces at the \ncrime scene, using it before advanced verification methods saves time.6 \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: drdilaraoner@gmail.com (D. ¨Oner Kaya), sukriye.karadayi@altinbas.edu.tr (S¸.

Case 2\nBased on the analysed well-shaped bloodstains, the groups of\ncentres of origin were determined on two additional locations in\nthe apartment, in the kitchen and in the dinette above a chair.\nGroup 1 in the kitchen consisted of three centres, marked with\ndark and light blue colour (Fig. 9). The centres were sited in the\nmiddle of the kitchen at a height of between 160 and 173 cm, the\ndark-blue centres were closer to the fridge and slightly higher than\nthe light blue centre.\nGroup 2 in the dinette consisted of one centre (green colour),\nwhich was sited 77 cm above the seat of a chair next to the wall\n(Fig. 10). This indicated that the victim sat on the chair whilst being\nbeaten. In fact, because of the low number of blood spatters, and\ntheir small size, it was presumed that the victim suffered a blow to\nthe head at an early stage of the attack.\n4. Discussion\nThe approximate areas of origin are mainly used to deduce\nwhether the victim was standing, sitting or lying down when the\nbloodstain pattern was created. In this case, the height of the blood\nsource locations is of great importance. Using only the classical\nstringing method, in cases of longer distance between the blood\nsource location and the bloodstain, a difference in the vertical\ncomponent between the spatial direction of impact and the\nexpected centre of origin arises because of the curved trajectory of\nthe drop. A principal task of ballistic analysis of the bloodstain\npattern in these cases is to conﬁrm if these bloodstains are also\nfrom the determined blood source locations. Therefore, the\nballistic determination of the curvature of the ﬂight paths of the\nblood drops is of great importance.\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6. In the aerial view of the scene, different coloured spheres represent the\nconvergence areas of the calculated impact directions of the blood spatters (case 1).\nThese areas of trajectory intersections are the centres of origin of corresponding\nbloodstains. Two groups of centres of origin were determined based on up to 150\nanalysed blood spatters. Both groups were sited above the pillow. The group 1 was\nsited between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress, approximately in the middle of the\npillow. This group consisted of three centres, marked by green, yellow and blue\ncolours. The green and yellow centres were very close together, the blue one was\nslightly higher and closer to the wall. The group 2 consisted of two centres, marked\nin red and sea-green colour, which were sited between 25 and 35 cm above the\nmattress on the right-side of the bed, closer to the wall than the group 1.\n[(Fig._7)TD$FIG]\nFig. 7. All analysed bloodstains were located at four or possibly ﬁve centres of origin\n(case 1). The 3D model shows the ballistic determined trajectories and the centres\nof origin.\n[(Fig._8)TD$FIG]\nFig. 8. On account of the overlapping bloodstains (yellow arrows) the group 1 of the centres of origin in the middle of the pillow appeared before the group 2 on the right-side\nof the pillow appeared (case 1).\nU.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

Immediately after an impact, this heat is\nconcentrated near the substrate surface. We measure the aver-\nage temperature T across the drop contact area for each ther-\nmal time-series image, as noted in Mean Temperature Calcula-\ntion (Fig. S2). Plotting this footprint temperature T over time t\nillustrates that the temperature rises rapidly during impact and\nthen returns asymptotically to Ts with a decay rate of ∼50 ms\n(Fig. 2B). For the conditions in this experiment, conductive heat\ntransfer is expected to dominate both convective and radiative\nheat transfer (Heat Transfer Mechanism). Additionally, during\nthe ﬁrst 100 ms after contact, the heat would be expected to dif-\nfuse throughout the glass substrate by a distance √αst ≈210 µm,\nwhere αs is the thermal diffusivity of the substrate (Table S1).\nBecause this distance is much less than the millimeter thickness\nof the glass and radius of the footprint, this early-time heat trans-\nfer can be approximated as one-dimensional and semiinﬁnite.\nAfter a pulse of energy, the surface temperature of a semi-\ninﬁnite, one-dimensional substrate decays in time following the\nclassic self-similar equation\nT(z = 0, t) −Ts =\nQ\nksπr 2m\np\nπt/αs\n,\n[1]\nwhere ks is the thermal conductivity and πr 2\nm is the contact area\nover which the energy Q is deposited. For a drop bouncing on\na superhydrophobic surface, the energy transfer is not instanta-\nneous; however, the residence time is signiﬁcantly shorter than\nthe subsequent temperature decay, so the heat transfer can be\nestimated by ﬁtting Eq. 1 to the average surface temperature in\nFig. 2B (dotted line). For the drop shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the\nestimated heat transferred is Q = 10 mJ.\nRole of Drop Size and Temperature. To explore the physics under-\nlying the ﬁnite-time heat transfer, we carry out a series of exper-\niments in which we systematically vary the drop size R and its\ninitial temperature Tℓ. In these experiments, we use water as\nthe liquid and soot-coated glass as the substrate. Additionally, we\nadjust the impact velocityU to constrain the spreading factor to\na range between rm/R = 1.2 and 1.7. Repeating the steps illus-\ntrated in Figs. 1 and 2, we calculate the transferred heat Q for\nvarying drop sizes R and temperature differences ∆T = Tℓ−Ts\n(Fig. 3). To illustrate the effect of the temperature difference\n∆T on the transferred heat Q, the data in Fig. 3 are sepa-\nrated into 10 ◦C increments, each of which is represented with\na different symbol orientation. Note that ∆T is negative when\ncold drops, rather than hot drops, impact the superhydrophobic\nsurface. The high-speed optical images allow us to identify the\nspreading factor rm/R for each drop, which are separated into\n0.1 increments depicted with symbol color and contrast (Fig. 3).\nAs the temperature difference, drop size, and spreading factor\nincrease, the amount of heat transferred increases as well.\nA key feature of bouncing drops on superhydrophobic and\nsuperheated surfaces is the trapped gas or vapor under the drop.\nIf this gas layer acts as a thermal barrier, we might expect the\nheat ﬂux to scale with an effective barrier thickness δ. For a given\nspreading factor, this model would predict the amount of heat\ntransferred to scale as the conduction heat ﬂux across the bar-\nrier ˙q ∼kg∆T/δ—where kg is the thermal conductivity of the\nconﬁned gas layer—integrated over the contact area ∼R2 for\nthe duration of the residence time tr ∼(ρℓR3/γ)\n1/2. Given the\nimportance of the air-ﬁlled microscale roughness on the super-\nhydrophobicity, a natural scale for the thickness δ might be the\nthickness of the superhydrophobic coating itself, which would not\nvary with drop size or contact time. From a simple scaling per-\nB\nA\nFig. 3.\nMeasurements of heat transferred by drops. (A) The exchanged\nheat Q varies with the drop size R; the temperature difference ∆T between\nthe drop and substrate (symbol orientation); and the extent of spreading,\nor spreading factor, rm/R (symbol color). The black arrows illustrate drops\nbouncing off of the substrate, leaving behind either a warm or cool foot-\nprint. (B) The data collapse into single curves for ﬁxed rm/R when the trans-\nferred heat Q is normalized by the initial temperature difference ∆T, show-\ning a power-law dependence on the drop radius R. Note that the larger\ntriangle corresponds to the speciﬁc drop illustrated in Fig. 2.\nspective, integrating with a constant gap thickness would lead to\nQ/∆T ∼(kg/δ)trR2 ∼(kg/δ)(.ρℓ/γ)0.5 R3.5.\nAn alternative hypothesis is that the trapped gas within the\nsuperhydrophobic microtexture has a negligible inﬂuence on\nthe heat transfer and that the heat transfer is dominated by the\nsubstrate below. In this case, the heat continues to propagate\ndownward into the substrate as the drop spreads and recoils;\nthe characteristic length is self-similar and grows as\n√\nαt. By\nsubstituting this length into the heat ﬂux, we ﬁnd .Q/∆T ∼\n(k/√αtr)trR2 ∼(k/√α)(ρℓ/γ)0.25R2.75. To evaluate this hy-\npothesis, the experimental results for the transferred heat Q\n(Fig. 3A) are normalized by the temperature difference ∆T and\nplotted over a logarithmic scale (Fig. 3B). The data collapse onto\na single curve and are more consistent with a power-law scaling\nof R2.75 than R3.5.\nIt is also possible that the heat transfer is dictated by an air\ncushion above the superhydrophobic surface and that this gap\ndepends on the radius R in such a way to produce a scaling con-\nsistent with Fig. 3B. Speciﬁcally, research on the trapped air layer\nover smooth surfaces (32) indicates that the cushion thickness\nscales as δ ∼R(ρℓUR/µg)−2/3, where µg is the viscosity of the\nair.

(B) A scanning electron microscope image\nof the soot layer reveals the submicrometer roughness responsible for the\nsubstrate superhydrophobicity.

Note that the spatial information from the thermal camera suffers\nfrom motion blur due to the 8-ms time response in the uncooled sensor. This\nexposure time is too long to accurately resolve details during the impact, but\nis short enough to characterize the thermal footprint left from the drop.\ntemperature Tℓ= 52.7 ◦C is released from a suspended needle\nand impacts, at velocity U = 0.74 ms−1, a soot-coated glass sub-\nstrate that is initially at ambient temperature Ts = 23.4 ◦C. Note\nthat the substrate temperature Ts is signiﬁcantly lower than the\nsaturation temperature for water. Even still, it is possible that the\ndrop might dimple as it nears impact, as has been documented\nfor drops as they approach smooth surfaces (25–27), trapping a\ncushion of air between the drop and the superhydrophobic sur-\nface (Fig. 1A).\nWhen the drop contacts the substrate, the chemistry and sub-\nmicrometer structure of the soot coating (Fig. 1B) repel the\nwater so that the water drop bounces off the surface. The time\nthat the drop resides on the substrate, deﬁned as the residence\ntime tr, is less than 15 ms (Fig. 1C). Simultaneous thermal images\nshow that the drop leaves the surface before reaching thermal\nequilibrium (Fig. 1D). The drop leaves a thermal footprint on the\nsubstrate that decays over time (Fig. 1E). Due to the 8-ms time\nresponse in the uncooled sensor, there is motion blur during drop\nimpact and recoil that is responsible for the apparent smearing of\nthe drop. However, these motion blur effects are negligible over\nthe longer timescales of the substrate footprint decay used in our\nanalysis.\nFurther details on the impact dynamics are revealed by plot-\nting the contact radius r(t) as the drop spreads and recoils on the\nsuperhydrophobic surface (Fig. 2A). From high-speed images,\nthe contact radius and residence time are extracted for the drop\nillustrated in Fig. 1. The drop spreads out to a maximum con-\ntact radius rm that is larger than the initial radius of the drop\nby a spreading factor of rm/R = 1.24. The drop then recoils\nuntil it loses contact with the surface at tr = 11.8 ms. The maxi-\nmum contact radius rm is known to depend on the Weber num-\nber We ≡ρℓU 2R/γ, a balance of inertial and capillary effects\nwhere ρℓis the liquid density, γ is the surface tension, and U\nis the impact velocity (28, 29). In this paper, we control the\nWeber number so that the spreading factor rm/R is limited to\na range between 1.2 and 1.7. In contrast, the residence time\nis largely independent of the Weber number (23) and instead\nscales with the inertial-capillary timescale\np\nρℓR3/γ.

    "text_chunk": "most well-known quantitative methodology in bloodstain pattern\nanalysis is the determination of point-of-origin via triangulation\n(cf. Refs. [5,6]), a methodology which depends on understanding\nthe complicated physics of drops in ﬂight [7]. This approach does\nnot help, however, in the differentiation of spatter versus contact\ntransfer on fabrics. Previous research speciﬁcally on bloodstains\nlocated on fabrics has focused primarily on individual drops\nimpacting various types of fabrics at different angles and velocities.\nKarger et al. investigated and characterized the differences\nbetween contact and ‘‘dynamic’’ (spatter) stains on three common\ntypes of fabric [8]. They found that individual millimeter scale\ndynamic stains tended to: (i) be more symmetric, (ii) yield more\n‘secondary droplets’ (presumably from splashing), and (iii) appear\ndarker overall because they tended to lie closer to the fabric\nsurface. In contrast, individual millimeter scale contact transfer\nstains tended to be asymmetric, lack secondary droplets, and were\npaler in color. Although Karger’s observations provide approximate\nguidelines for distinguishing contact transfer and dynamic stains,\nthe guidelines are qualitative: for example, different experts can\nargue about how ‘‘symmetric’’ a stain appears. More recently,\nHolbrook examined bloodstains on a wider range of fabrics and\nfound that certain fabric characteristics, such as composition and\nabsorbency, appear to be factors for the appearance of bloodstains\non clothing materials [9]. This work also suggested that the shape\nof the stains appeared to be associated with their overall size.\nStains that were smaller than the width of a single thread tended to\nretain highly circular shapes, whereas stains that were wide\nenough to cover multiple threads were more distorted. Again,\nhowever, these characterizations are qualitative and thus subject\nto debate amongst analysts. Clearly, quantitative characteristics\nthat can serve as objective guidelines for differentiating spatter\nstains and transfer stains are needed.\nThe objective of this study is to develop a quantitative\nmethodology \nto \ndifferentiate \ncontact \ntransfer \nfrom \nspatter\nbloodstain patterns on the face side of common knitted fabrics.\nWe focus here on microscopic examination of bloodstains on the\n‘‘stockinette’’ knitting pattern, which is ubiquitous in modern mass\nproduced clothing (e.g., T-shirts, polo shirts, etc.) Stockinette\npatterns involve stitch loops of yarn repeated throughout the fabric\n[10]; each loop contains a loop head, two loop legs and the loop feet\n(Fig. 1a). Importantly, on the face side (i.e., on the side of the fabric\ntypically worn away from the body) the loop legs are apparent as\nparallel rows of alternate opposing orientations, upward diagonal\n(/) and downward diagonal (\\), cf. Fig. 1b. The key ﬁnding in this\nwork is that blood preferentially absorbs into the upward diagonal\n(left) loop legs during contact transfer, whereas spatter is more evenly\ndistributed between the two orientations. We further show via\nconfocal microscopy that the upward diagonal (left) loop legs\nprotrude further outward by about 50 mm compared to the\ndownward diagonal (right) loop legs, indicating that the fabric\ntopography determines the preferential absorption during contact\ntransfer. The results point toward an objective and quantitative\nmeans of differentiating contact transfer and spatter on fabrics that\ncontain similar topographical asymmetries.\n2. Study design and methodology\n2.1. Materials and methods\nPorcine (pig) blood, obtained from freshly killed pigs at the\nAnimal Science meat lab on the UC Davis campus, was used for all\nexperiments in this study. Standard BD EDTA tubes (ethylenedia-\nminetetraacetic acid) were used as anticoagulant containers. The\nblood samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 8C shortly after\ncollection from the pigs.\nAll blood was used within 1–5 days from collection date. Prior\nto an experiment, the blood samples were warmed up to human\nbody temperature (37 8C) in a circulating water bath for 30–\n45 min. The blood was then transferred to a pre-warmed atomizer\n(a standard perfume bottle) and left in the water bath for another\n15–20 min until the experiments were performed. The tempera-\nture of the water bath was monitored to ensure the temperature\nwas kept constant throughout the experiments.\nThe fabrics were purchased from a local clothing store as white\nT-shirts. Two fabric materials were tested: 100% cotton and 50%\ncotton/50% polyester. White fabrics were chosen to simplify\nvisualization of the blood. The stockinette weaving of the two\nfabrics was veriﬁed via microscopic examination to follow the\nsame pattern.\nThe fabrics were stained with the blood in two distinct manners\n(Fig. 2). For the ‘‘spatter’’ patterns (Fig. 2a each stain pattern was\nformed by a single spray of the atomizer directly onto the fabric.\nThe atomizer was held approximately 10 cm above from the fabric\nsurface, which was placed horizontally on a bench surface in lab.\nTen replicates of this procedure were performed with both types of\nfabric (20 trials in total).\nIn contrast, the contact transfer bloodstain patterns were\ngenerated by ﬁrst spraying the blood onto a ‘‘donor’’ surface\n(Fig. 2b). The blood was sprayed from the atomizer in an identical\nfashion as in the spatter replicates (10 cm above the horizontal\ndonor surface). Two types of donor surfaces were tested: leather, to\nrepresent a more pliable surface comparable to human skin, and\nglass, to represent a rigid and smooth surface. Immediately after\nspraying the blood onto the donor surface, the fabric of interest\nwas then pressed by hand onto the donor surface to transfer the\nblood via direct contact. Similarly, we performed 10 replicates of\nFig. 1. (a) A schematic diagram in the Stockinette knitting pattern, as viewed from the face side of the fabric.

There are several possible chemicals that will act as an\nanticoagulant. In the current experiments, human blood with a\nsodium citrate anticoagulant was chosen, as it can be deactivated\nby adding a 1:59 ratio of 0.5 molar calcium chloride solution [32].\nThe material properties of this mixture are not expected to vary\nsigniﬁcantly from the properties of the blood itself. Measurements\nfrom pendent drop experiments indicate that the surface tension\ndecreases to g = 60.7 \u0003 0.9 mN m\u00041, a volume fraction calculation\nsuggests that the density decreases to r = 1020 \u0003 8 kg m\u00043, and\nfrom Grunberg–Nissan mixing rule [33], the mixture viscosity is\nestimated to decrease to m = 4.1 mPa s.\n2.4. Blood impact experiments\nTo explore the inﬂuence of the surface coatings on the ﬁnal\nbloodstains, a series of drop impact experiments are carried out\n(Fig. 2). After the human blood was resuspended and warmed, it\nwas placed into a syringe located at a height h above the prepared\nsurface. The radius of the released drop was selected to be either\nR = 1.0 \u0003 0.1 mm or R = 2.0 \u0003 0.1 mm. This size was controlled with\nthe diameter of the syringe needle, and because any dried blood on\nthe needle might alter the drop size, a new needle was used before\neach experiment. Upon detaching from the needle, the drop would\nfall onto the target surface, accelerating under the inﬂuence of\ngravity. Impact velocity adjustments U were made by changing the\nheight h at which drops were released.\nThe impact dynamics from a side perspective were captured\nwith a high-speed camera (Photron SA-5) ﬁlming at 10 000 frames\nper second. From these images, the size R and velocity U could be\ncalculated for each individual blood drop at the moment of impact.\nA second high-speed camera (Photron SA-X2) was synchronized to\ntake simultaneous images from a top-down perspective (Fig. 2).\nThe combination of vantage points allowed for a more complete\nmeasurement of the droplet shape as it impacted and spread along\nthe surface, including measurements of processes that might break\nsymmetry. Within a minute after impact, the sample was carefully\nmoved to a back-lit platform, and images were captured every\nminute for three hours with a Nikon DSLR camera (Fig. 2).\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Bloodstains on clean glass\nThe results from the experiments on the clean glass are\npresented and discussed ﬁrst, as bloodstains on these surfaces\nhave been studied in the past [9] and can provide a baseline from\nwhich to evaluate the other surfaces. Blood drops of two sizes\n(R = 1 mm and 2 mm) were released from four heights: h = 10 cm,\n20 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm. The measured impact velocity ranged\nfrom U = 1.5 m s\u00041 to 6.1 m s\u00041, consistent with gravitational\nacceleration resisted by air drag (Fig. 3a). Note that even when\nreleased from 200 cm, the drops are expected to be below their\nterminal velocity Ut when they impact the substrate. Terminal\nvelocity can be estimated by balancing the weight of the drop and\nthe drag force with the coefﬁcient of drag approximated to be 0.47\n(black lines on left-side of Fig. 3a). These terminal velocities are\nsimilar to what has been measured for rain drops [34].\nFig. 3b shows images of the blood stains that result from these\nblood drops after they impact and dry on the glass surface. Each\nbloodstain is circular with a ﬁnal size rf that depend on the initial\nsize R and release height h. More generally, the ﬁnal stain size on a\ngiven surface is considered to depend on the initial drop diameter\n2R, impact velocity U, density r, viscosity m, and surface tension g.\nThrough dimensional analysis, the parameter space can be reduced\nsuch that the spreading factor β = rf/R depends only on two\nvariables, the Reynolds number, Re \u0005 rU(2R)/m and the Weber\nnumber We \u0005 r(2R)U2/g.\nThe results in Fig. 3b are consistent with several existing\nmodels, two of which are directly compared (Fig. 3c). The ﬁrst\nexpression [15] is based on an energy balance and predicts that for\nhorizontal surfaces\nrf\nR ¼ b ¼\nWe þ 12\n3ð1 \u0004 \ncos \nuÞ þ 4We Re\u00041=2\n  \n!1=2\n; \nð1Þ\nwhere u is the equilibrium contact angle. Another expression [16]\nis written in terms of a Padé approximant, an approximation that is\nwritten in terms of a ratio of two power series. These series are\nadvantageous in that they typically converge rapidly relative to\nother standard approximations, and therefore can be more\nFig.1.

After impact, the sample was\nmoved to a back-lit stand and was photographed every minute as it dried. In\naddition to the substrate coating, the size of drop R and release height h were varied\nbetween experiments.\nS. Shiri et al. / Forensic Science International 295 (2019) 189–198 \n191"

The Scientiﬁc Working Group on Bloodstain\nPattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN) deﬁnes a transfer stain as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from contact between a blood-bearing surface\nand another surface’’, whereas spatter stain is deﬁned as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from a blood drop dispersed through the air\ndue to an external force applied to a source of liquid blood’’ [1].\nAlthough these deﬁnitions are clear, the differentiation between\nthem is challenging, especially when the bloodstain is on fabric. As\ncurrently practiced, the interpretations of bloodstain patterns by\nbloodstain pattern analysts are mostly based upon the experience\nlevel of the analysts and the qualitative characteristics of the\nbloodstain patterns. Because of the analysts’ subjective analysis of\nbloodstain patterns found at the crime scene, however, experts\noften provide different interpretations of the same bloodstain\npattern evidence. For example, in Indiana v. Camm [2] the state\ncalled four expert witnesses, all of whom testiﬁed that some of the\nbloodstains on the defendant’s shirt were the result of high-\nvelocity impact spatter. In contrast, the defense called their own\nfour bloodstain analysis expert witnesses, and these four experts\ntestiﬁed that all of the bloodstains on the defendant’s shirt resulted\nfrom contact transfer. A similar example occurred in the Supreme\nCourt of California case People v. McWhorter [3], in which the\nexperts called upon to testify by the prosecution and defense had\ndifferent interpretations of the bloodstains found on a paper towel\ncollected at the crime scene: the defense expert said the stains\nwere ‘‘expectorated’’ (nasal blowing pattern) whereas the prose-\ncutor’s criminalist said the bloodstains were transfer stains.\nSumming matters up, the National Research Council stated in\ntheir recent report that the interpretations of bloodstain pattern\nanalysts ‘‘are more subjective than scientiﬁc’’ [4].\nA key reason for the subjectivity is the lack of quantitative\nmethods for characterizing bloodstains on fabrics. Arguably the\nForensic Science International 249 (2015) 233–240\nA R T I C L E \nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 28 August 2014\nReceived in revised form 15 January 2015\nAccepted 23 January 2015\nAvailable online 4 February 2015\nKeywords:\nStockinette\nBPA\nTextiles\nCotton\nPolyester\nDrops\nA B S T R A C T\nIn crime scene reconstruction, it is often necessary to differentiate ‘‘contact transfer’’ and ‘‘spatter’’\nbloodstain patterns found on clothing. Current methodologies, however, are qualitative and prone to\ncontext bias. In this work, we demonstrate that microscopic inspection of the stain orientations provides\na quantitative differentiation of bloodstains resulting from spatter versus contact transfer. Speciﬁcally,\ncommon knitted fabrics are comprised of parallel rows of left loop legs, in an upward diagonal orientation\n(/), and right loop legs in a downward diagonal orientation (\\). Our microscopic examination of more than\n65,000 individual stained loop legs shows that spatter stains are approximately evenly distributed\nbetween left and right loop legs, but contact transfer stains are unevenly distributed: depending on the\ntype of surface contacted, as many as 82% of the stains were preferentially located on the left loop legs. We\nfurther show that in these fabrics the left loop legs protrude further out than the right loop legs by\napproximately 50 mm, indicating that the observation of left loop legs preferentially stained over right\nloop legs is associated with the topography of the fabric. These ﬁndings suggest that microscopic\nquantiﬁcation of the relative loop leg stain distributions could provide an objective means of\ndifferentiating contact transfer versus spatter patterns in crime scene reconstruction.\n\u0002 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

    "text_chunk": "Research into the dynamics of fluids other than blood offers\nsome insight into this complex interaction (13–15). It begins when\nan object strikes a liquid source, transferring energy through com-\npression and forcing liquid displacement away from the strike\npoint. The amount of transferred energy will correlate with the\ndegree of fluid displacement. As the liquid undergoes displacement,\nthe ratio of surface area to volume increases. To counter this insta-\nbility, the displaced liquid will either recoil through counteracting\nsurface tension forces or disintegrate into smaller fragments where\nthe energy is great enough. Ultimately, aerodynamic forces govern\ndroplet size. The higher the velocity of blood displacement, the\ngreater the instability created at the liquid–gas interface, resulting\nin the generation of smaller droplets. This provides some support\nfor the current correlations made within the BPA community\nbetween bloodstain size and droplet velocity. Liquid displacement\nis quite complex, however, and not all of the liquid will be travel-\ning at the same velocity. This could result in a variety of droplet\nsizes, in addition to the generation of sheets and filaments. As\nblood has a relatively high viscosity when compared to water, this\nincreased resistance to flow will counteract displacement and\nincrease the probability of encountering sheets and filaments, as\nreadily observed in Fig. 1. Unlike droplets, sheets and filaments are\ninherently unstable because of their higher surface area-to-volume\nratio and will either recoil into a single droplet or further disinte-\ngrate into multiple droplets.\nOnce airborne, droplet flight trajectory is governed by the effects\nof gravity and drag (or air resistance). Gravity results in downward\ndroplet acceleration and can be modeled using the following pro-\njectile motion equations:\nyðtÞ ¼ \u0002 1\n2 gt2 þ voyt þ yo\nð2Þ\nvyðtÞ ¼ \u0002gt þ voy\nð3Þ\nayðtÞ ¼ \u0002g\nð4Þ\nvxðtÞ ¼ vox ¼ vo cos ho\nð5Þ\nxðtÞ ¼ vxot þ xo\nð6Þ\naxðtÞ ¼ 0\nð7Þ\ntan h ¼ vy\nvx\nð8Þ\nThe force applied to the body of a droplet in motion by the sur-\nrounding air is called drag and acts in the opposite direction of\ndroplet motion. The value of drag force can be calculated using the\nfollowing equation:\nFDrag ¼ CD\n1\n2 qairV2 p\n4 D2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\nð9Þ\nwhere q is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, and D is the\ndroplet diameter. CD is the coefficient of drag, which is a function\nof Reynolds number and depends on the shape of the object. The\nReynolds number for a sphere is defined as:\nRe ¼ qDoVo\nl\nð10Þ\nwhere D is the droplet diameter, and l is the fluid viscosity.\nThe aim of this research was to utilize a novel experimental\ndesign to investigate the error associated with the standard calcula-\ntions for AO. Starting with a mock crime scene experimental\napproach, the initial volume of blood was significantly reduced,\nand the disintegration process was propagated through the applica-\ntion of a short burst of pressurized air. These two modifications\nallowed for better resolution of the disintegration process to provide\na window into the underlying mechanisms responsible for AO\nerror.\nMaterials and Methods\nA gas tank filled with pressurized air was connected to a nozzle\nvia stainless steel tubing. A pressure gauge was used to measure\nair pressure, while a solenoid valve with digital pulse generator\nensured a controlled release of air from the nozzle. This apparatus\nwas contained within an aluminum frame structure to allow for ver-\ntical adjustment. Iron plates secured to the structure ensured it\nwould not move during operation. A diagram of this experimental\nsetup is shown in Fig. 2.\nA syringe, mounted within a syringe pump to regulate flow rate,\nwas connected to a stainless steel needle using clear plastic tubing.\nThe syringe and needle were clamped within the apparatus such\nthat a droplet suspended from the needle would be directly within\nthe path of pressurized air released from the nozzle. Pig blood was\nchosen owing to similarities in physical properties with human\nblood. The reader is directed to our previous article for additional\ninformation regarding these properties (10).\nFresh pig blood was obtained from an abattoir (Quality Meat\nPackers, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and stored in test tubes contain-\ning the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The\nblood was stored at 4\u0003C and was used within 48 h of collection.\nBlood was placed into the syringe pump, which was then utilized\nto deliver a specific volume of blood, resulting in consistent sized\nblood droplets suspended from the needle tip. Droplet diameter was\nmeasured directly from the high-speed images taken immediately\nprior to disintegration, using the needle diameter as a calibration\nreference. Blood droplet and needle diameters are shown in\nTable 1.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

By plotting the cosine of\nthe measured contact angles as a function of surface tension\n(Figure 2b), (σSV −σSL) is found by ﬁtting a straight line\nthrough the data using the least squares method and\nextrapolating the ﬁts to the surface tension for which the\nliquid would fully wet the surface (cos(θ) = 1). Because glass is\ncompletely wetted by all evaluated liquids, the critical surface\ntension of glass is higher than 71.99 mN/m. For steel and\nparaﬁlm, a critical surface tension of 14 ± 1 and 19 ± 1 mN/m\nis found, respectively. Therefore, liquids wet the paraﬁlm less\ncompared to the steel surface.\nThe measured splashing velocities of the ethanol−water\nmixtures are plotted as a function of liquid surface tension in\nFigure 3a. The graph shows that the splashing velocity\nincreases roughly linearly with the surface tension. For pure\nwater droplets, no splashing was observed within the velocity\nrange investigated here (0.1 < v < 4.7 m/s). No signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence between the three evaluated surfaces is observed,\nimplying that the splashing velocity is independent of the\nwetting properties of the substrate. The same holds for blood\n(Figure 3b), where the splashing velocity remains constant\n(∼3.47 m/s) for all observed substrates. These results suggest\nthat the wetting properties of the substrate do not inﬂuence the\nsplashing velocity of both ethanol−water mixtures and blood,\nwhich is the ﬁrst useful conclusion. This is remarkable as the\ndroplet is in full contact with the substrate during splash-\ning.35,36 However, in ref 35, it was also observed that just\nbefore splashing, the edge of the liquid sheet dewets the\nsurface from which the satellite droplets are formed (see Figure\n4a−d).\nAlthough surface roughness is not considered in this paper,\nit can also inﬂuence splashing.16,17 On rough surfaces, the\nliquid sheet does not detach from the surface prior to breakup,\ngiving rise to a diﬀerent splash known as a “prompt splash”.9,17\nThe inﬂuence of surface roughness was not considered in the\nsplashing model of ref 20. How the surface roughness can be\nincorporated into the splashing model is currently unknown\nand beyond the scope of this paper.\nTo describe splashing, in ref 20, the ejection time te (the\nmoment a thin liquid sheet appears from the droplet after\nimpact) is ﬁrst calculated numerically using the momentum\nbalance equation\nRe t\nRe\nOh\nt\n3\n2\n1.21\n1\ne\n1/2\n2\n2\ne\n3/2\n+\n=\n−\n−\n−\n−\n(2)\nwhere Re\nRv\n= ρ\nμ\nand Oh\nR\n=\nμ\nρ σ\nare the Reynolds and\nOhnesorge numbers, respectively; ρ is the density, μ is the\nviscosity, σ is the surface tension of the liquid (equal to σLV), R\nFigure 3.

Blood handling\nFor the blood droplet impact studies on solid surfaces, blood\nfrom healthy swine is utilized, which is comparable to human blood\nby its ability to assemble in rouleaux at low shear rates [17,18]. The\nblood used in this study is purchased from the National Animal\nDisease Center, in Ames, IA. The anticoagulant used is 1% heparin.\nBefore use, the blood is placed on a rocker (Labquake, Thermo\nScientiﬁc) until it reaches room temperature. The hematocrit of the\nblood is measured through centrifugation (STI, HemataStat-II) at\n1548–2312 g for 60 \u0002 3 s, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The\ntemperature of blood, room temperature and relative humidity are\nalso documented prior to experimentation. No blood samples older\nthan three days were used in the experiments.\n2.2. Blood rheometry\nBefore each blood droplet impact experiment, blood viscosity is\nmeasured at the documented temperature and at different shear\nrates (seven measurements are taken with shear rates ranging\nfrom 10 to 2500 s\u00031), using the capillary viscometer setup shown\nin Fig. 1. The setup comprises a syringe pump (KD Scientiﬁc,\n780230) which pumps blood into a hard polycarbonate capillary\ntube (FEP, ID 0.521 mm, length 1.575 m), with a controlled ﬂow\nrate between 0.01 and 2 mL/min. These values of ﬂow rates\ncorrespond to a Reynolds number Re < 600, thereby assuring a\nlaminar ﬂow. A differential pressure sensor (Omega DPG 110, with\na range of 1 to 7 bar and accuracy < 0.5%) is employed to measure\nthe pressure drop DP along the tube at different ﬂow rates Q. The\nentry length (Le) for Newtonian ﬂows is theoretically calculated as\nLe/D = 0.06Re, where D is the internal diameter of the tubing\n[19]. For Re = 600, the entry length for a Newtonian ﬂow comes out\nto be 18 mm, and that for a shear-thinning ﬂuid is of comparable\nlength [20]. In the experimental setup, an entry length of 12 cm is\nprovided to ensure that the velocity proﬁle is fully developed\nbefore reaching the pressure sensor.\nThe Ostwald-de Waele power-law equation is used to describe\nthe shear-thinning behavior\nt ¼ K ˙gn;\n(1)\nwith ˙g is the shear rate, t, the shear stress, and K and n the\nrespective\nﬂow\nconsistency\nand\nnon-Newtonian\npower-law\nexponent.

The relative uncertainty (SD = 4%) on\nthe viscosity measurements with the capillary viscometer is\nmostly due to the uncertainty on the temperature and on the\npressure measurement.\nThe viscosity measurement reaches a plateau (4.1 \u0002 0.05 mPa,s)\nabove a shear rate of approximately 580 s\u00031. While the chosen\nmathematical correlation matches well with the data points in\ngeneral, there is a slight mismatch where the measured viscosity\nreaches a plateau due to the inherent mathematical shape of the curve\nﬁt. Expressions for the viscosity accounting for the dependency on\nshear rate, temperature (T) [6] and hematocrit (H) can be obtained as\nfollows. First, the power law curves, equation (5), of six blood samples\n(labeled A to F), measured at different temperature and hematocrit\nlevels, are tabulated in Table 1.\nThen, the viscosity at a given shear rate is expressed as a linear\nfunction of T and H, as in\nmð ˙gÞ ¼ a0 þ a1T þ a2H;\n(5)\nwhere, a0, a1 and a2 are coefﬁcients calculated using the method of\nleast squares[23]:\nN\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nHi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTi\n2\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTiHi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nHi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTiHi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nHi\n2\n2\n6666666664\n3\n7777777775\na0\na1\na2\n2\n4\n3\n5 ¼\nX\nN\ni¼1\nmi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTimi\nX\nN\ni¼1\nHimi\n2\n6666666664\n3\n7777777775\n(6)\nAlthough the viscosity typically varies exponentially with\ntemperature [19], the small temperature range (15–30 8C) in the\npresent experiments allows a linear assumption between the\nviscosity and temperature[13].\nA question arises as to which shear rate to use for evaluating the\nviscosity. In drop impacts with relevance to bloodstain pattern\nanalysis, the shear rate is on the order of the impact velocity\ndivided by the drop diameter [7]. Taking a typical case of a 1 mm\ndroplet travelling at 2 m/s or faster, this corresponds to a shear rate\nof 2000 s\u00031 or larger. Also, as observed in Fig. 2, the viscosity attains\na plateau above a shear rate of approximately 580 s\u00031. This plateau,\nphysically corresponds to the situation where shear is so high that\n[(Fig._1)TD$FIG]\nFig. 1.

We therefore use a\nsimpliﬁcation, also given by Riboux and Gordillo, valid for\nlow Ohnesorge numbers and atmospheric conditions, which is\nthe situation that pertains to most practical applications and\nshow that it predicts the splashing velocity very well. These\nresults show that the splashing velocity is independent of the\nsurface wetting properties and that blood can be approximated\nas a Newtonian ﬂuid during splashing.\n■MATERIALS AND METHODS\nTo measure the splashing velocity vsp, droplet impacts were recorded\nusing a high-speed camera (Phantom Miro M310). The droplets were\ngenerated from a blunt-tipped needle (needle diameter 0.4 mm) using\na syringe pump, where the needle was suspended above the substrate\nat a certain height. By systematically increasing the height of the\nneedle and checking whether the droplet merely spreads over the\nsurface (Figure 1a) or splashes (Figure 1b) for each height, we\ndetermined the initial droplet diameter D0 and impact velocity v at the\nonset of splashing for each liquid. The ﬂuid parameters of each liquid\nare given in Table 1. Three diﬀerent surfaces were investigated for the\nethanol−water mixtures: stainless steel, glass (Objektträger, Menzel\nGlaser, Thermo Scientiﬁc), and paraﬁlm. All three surfaces were\nconsidered smooth, each having an arithmetic average roughness Ra\nbelow 0.5 μm.22 For blood, the splashing velocity was determined\nfrom blood droplet impact footage on glass (θst ≈20°; where θst is the\nstatic contact angle of water21), acrylic glass [poly(methyl\nmethacrylate), PMMA; θst ≈70°], Trespa (θst ≈82°), and\npolyoxymethylene (POM; θst ≈79°) surfaces using the data of ref\n21. The density (1055 kg/m3), surface tension (59 mN/m), and\nviscosity (4.8 mPa·s) of the blood used are also given by Laan et al.21\nBoth the impacts of Newtonian ﬂuids and blood were measured at 21\n°C and atmospheric pressure. During the experiments with blood, the\nanti-coagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was added to prevent\nthe coagulation of blood.\n■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFor each ethanol−water mixture, the contact angle θ on steel,\nglass, and paraﬁlm was measured using the sessile drop\nmethod.30,31 Because of surface inhomogeneities, a droplet\ndeposited on a surface does not have a unique contact angle\nbut attains a contact angle that ranges between the advancing\n(θa) and receding (θr) contact angle.32 In Figure 2a, θa is\nplotted as a function of the surface tension. In glass, the\ncontact angles of each ﬂuid were too small to be determined.\nTherefore, each ﬂuid is considered to be completely wetting\nthe glass surface (θa ≈0°). Do note that the glass used in this\nstudy has a lower contact angle compared to the glass used in\nthe study of ref 21. All liquids have a similar receding angle of\nroughly 20° when deposited on steel. When deposited on\nparaﬁlm, the receding contact angles of all liquids were\nconsistently 10° lower than their corresponding advancing\nangle.\nTo characterize the diﬀerence in wetting properties of the\nthree substrates, Young’s law is used, which describes the force\nbalance between the interfacial tensions of the substrate, liquid\ndroplet, and the surrounding vapor23,33\ncos( )\nSV\nSL\nLV\nσ\nσ\nσ\nθ\n−\n=\n(1)\nwhere σLV is the liquid−vapor interfacial tension of the liquid.\nσSV and σSL are the solid−vapor and solid−liquid interfacial\ntensions, respectively. Zisman assumed that the diﬀerence\nbetween σSV and σSL is a property of the solid that gives the\nsurface free energy of the substrate.23,31,34 (σSV −σSL) can be\ndetermined by ﬁnding the critical surface tension from the\ncontact angle measurements: the surface tension at which a\nTable 1.

This study \naimed to investigate the effects of washing temperature, fabric type, fabric color, and stain age (time from \nstaining to laundering) on the detection and identification of bloodstains on fabrics after washing. \nMaterial and method: A total of 240 fabrics (4 different colors and 5 different types) were stained with blood and \nwashed in 4 different washing temperatures with 3 different lag times. The evaluations of fabric images were \nperformed using the FLS system (Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems®) on a total of \n1200 images using 5 different wavelengths and filter options. The bloodstained areas of the fabric pieces were \nthen excised, and the hemoglobin presence was analyzed using the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test. \nResults: The analyses of laundered samples using the FLS system revealed that the best images were obtained \nfrom velvet, cotton fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics, in that order. Except for polyester fabrics, the SERATEC® \nHemDirect hemoglobin screening test, which was used to detect bloodstains on fabrics, showed positive results \nafter washing at low temperatures (approximately 15 ◦C and 30 ◦C). At higher temperatures (60 ◦C and 90 ◦C), \nthe SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test yielded negative results. \nConclusion: The fabric type and color played a crucial role in stain detection using the FLS system on the \nlaundered fabrics. The FLS system and the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test revealed that stain age had a \nlimited effect on the stain’s detectability.   \n1. Introduction \nDetection of biological stains at the crime scene and DNA extraction \nfrom these samples are critical steps in identifying the offender or victim \nof the incident. Bloodstains are among the most common stains found at \ncrime scenes and have a significant forensic value in terms of criminal \njustice.1–3 Bloodstains can often be found on different fabrics, such as \nclothes, sheets, or blankets, belonging to individuals involved in a \nforensic case. The characteristics of fabrics, including thickness, \nweaving pattern, content, and color, affect the formation of blood­\nstains.4 These factors may influence the visibility and detectability of \nbloodstains at the crime scene. \nEven when blood is visible at the crime scene, the visibility of \nbloodstains may need enhancement if it is present in less quantity, not \nclearly visible on the surface, or has been dragged by objects, such as \nshoes.5 In addition, bloodstained clothing or items may be destroyed or \nwashed after a while to hide the crime.1 \nAlthough there are numerous methods for detecting bloodstains, \nespecially in cases where samples are scarce, important evidence such as \nDNA may be compromised by DNA degradation due to destruction of the \nbloodstained samples.5–7 The most commonly observed body fluid at a \ncrime scene is blood.7 Many crimes, ranging from murder to assault, \ninvolve blood.8 Bloodstains can absorb light at wavelength 415 nm.9 The \nForenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems (FLS) \nsystem readily allows visualization of the location of the stains and \ndocumentation as scientific evidence, which can be then presented to \nthe court.10 The FLS system is a nondestructive and noninvasive method \nbased on the absorptive and photoluminescent properties of the bio­\nlogical stains.10,11 As it permits rapid scanning of large surfaces at the \ncrime scene, using it before advanced verification methods saves time.6 \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: drdilaraoner@gmail.com (D. ¨Oner Kaya), sukriye.karadayi@altinbas.edu.tr (S¸.

(B) A scanning electron microscope image\nof the soot layer reveals the submicrometer roughness responsible for the\nsubstrate superhydrophobicity. (C) High-speed images show that the water\ndrop bounces, residing on the surface for a ﬁnite time tr = 11.8 ms.

Note that the spatial information from the thermal camera suffers\nfrom motion blur due to the 8-ms time response in the uncooled sensor. This\nexposure time is too long to accurately resolve details during the impact, but\nis short enough to characterize the thermal footprint left from the drop.\ntemperature Tℓ= 52.7 ◦C is released from a suspended needle\nand impacts, at velocity U = 0.74 ms−1, a soot-coated glass sub-\nstrate that is initially at ambient temperature Ts = 23.4 ◦C. Note\nthat the substrate temperature Ts is signiﬁcantly lower than the\nsaturation temperature for water. Even still, it is possible that the\ndrop might dimple as it nears impact, as has been documented\nfor drops as they approach smooth surfaces (25–27), trapping a\ncushion of air between the drop and the superhydrophobic sur-\nface (Fig. 1A).\nWhen the drop contacts the substrate, the chemistry and sub-\nmicrometer structure of the soot coating (Fig. 1B) repel the\nwater so that the water drop bounces off the surface. The time\nthat the drop resides on the substrate, deﬁned as the residence\ntime tr, is less than 15 ms (Fig. 1C). Simultaneous thermal images\nshow that the drop leaves the surface before reaching thermal\nequilibrium (Fig. 1D). The drop leaves a thermal footprint on the\nsubstrate that decays over time (Fig. 1E). Due to the 8-ms time\nresponse in the uncooled sensor, there is motion blur during drop\nimpact and recoil that is responsible for the apparent smearing of\nthe drop. However, these motion blur effects are negligible over\nthe longer timescales of the substrate footprint decay used in our\nanalysis.\nFurther details on the impact dynamics are revealed by plot-\nting the contact radius r(t) as the drop spreads and recoils on the\nsuperhydrophobic surface (Fig. 2A). From high-speed images,\nthe contact radius and residence time are extracted for the drop\nillustrated in Fig. 1. The drop spreads out to a maximum con-\ntact radius rm that is larger than the initial radius of the drop\nby a spreading factor of rm/R = 1.24. The drop then recoils\nuntil it loses contact with the surface at tr = 11.8 ms. The maxi-\nmum contact radius rm is known to depend on the Weber num-\nber We ≡ρℓU 2R/γ, a balance of inertial and capillary effects\nwhere ρℓis the liquid density, γ is the surface tension, and U\nis the impact velocity (28, 29). In this paper, we control the\nWeber number so that the spreading factor rm/R is limited to\na range between 1.2 and 1.7. In contrast, the residence time\nis largely independent of the Weber number (23) and instead\nscales with the inertial-capillary timescale\np\nρℓR3/γ.

(2006b).\nspreading dynamics are an important aspect in many applications, for instance, for inkjet printing\nin microelectronics (Minemawari et al. 2011) or in forensic science (Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nAttinger et al. 2013, Laan et al. 2014). In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009). This is particularly the case when\n372\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

    "text_chunk": "3.3. Spitting, or nasal snorting, of instilled blood in the semi-prone\nposture\nThe average total numbers of spots on the overalls for each type\nof manoeuvre are shown in Fig. 8. In all experiments, the great\nmajority of spots were less, or much less, than 1 mm diameter.\nSpots were widely distributed on the overalls, but especially to the\nleft arm and chest in the nasal exhalations; they were biased to the\nhips and thighs and the right leg for the spitting exhalations; this\nprobably reﬂected differences in the primary direction of the\nexhaled stream.\nIn Series A, the bulk of the spots were on the left forearm which\nappeared to shield the remaining body regions and the left chest\ntook a reasonable density of droplet hits, the remainder of the body\nwas relatively balanced between left and right sided hits. In Series\nB, the target was moved down from more the face level to chest\nlevel and it would appear that the heaviest capture density was left\nchest to waist. The target had possibly moved more into the ﬁring\nline of the nasal exhalation, which would be expected to be more in\nthis direction than in Series A. This would also explain the\ngenerally higher total counts overall. In Series C, the mouth spit\nwould have been expected to be more directed to the target than\nwas the case for Series A with nasal exhalations. The distribution\nwas relatively balanced left to right.\nThe deposition distributions in the three series relate reason-\nably to the relative positioning and means of exhalation. The fact\nthat the nearer body parts often had the highest spot counts did not\ndiminish the explicitly recorded observation that signiﬁcant\nnumbers of spots were found on the more distant body regions\nthat were in line with the exhalation and not shielded by other\nparts, more proximal to the source.\n3.4. Use of a simpliﬁed physical nose model\nDrops of blood, placed at the distal tip of the nasal tube (Fig. 1,\nposition 1), tended to be propelled only a short distance on\nexhalation, producing only a small amount of spray. The moment\nthe exhalation was initiated, a small amount of spray was\nproduced, blood predominantly fell out of the tube to the ground\nbelow creating a few splashes several millimetres diameter.\nWhen blood was instilled approx. 1 cm behind the tip (position\n2), a different pattern of elimination was observed. The blood ﬁlm\nsurface was torn by the airﬂow and the expelled droplets\ntransported along with the exhaled air. In all cases, the vertical\ntarget surface intercepted many hundreds of very small droplets,\nproducing spots typically much less than 0.5 mm diameter, many\nbeing less than 0.1 mm dia., along with some larger spots. Some\nspots, mainly larger ones, were also detected on the horizontal\ntarget surface. When the nasal tube was inclined upwards, the\ninterception distance was observed to be greater than 1 m for\nmany droplets, both small and large.\nWhen blood was instilled further back within the cavity\n(position 3), the blood ﬁlm was again torn by the emerging airﬂow\ninto droplets of a range of sizes. However, the larger droplets\ntended to impact on the walls of the cavity upstream of the valve,\nleaving a stream of smaller droplets to emerge as before,\ngenerating a pattern of interception on the vertical target of\nalmost entirely small spots with comparatively few being observed\non the horizontal target.\n3.5. General\nWhilst the diameter of the droplets producing the individual\nspots could not be measured directly, the captured blood wetted\nthe paper surface and thus spread to cover an area larger than the\noriginating droplet; in consequence, the measured spot sizes were\ncertainly larger than the droplet diameter.\nThe typical speed of the exhaled air package varied considerably\nbetween the four studies on the basis of the estimated exhaled\nvolumes and periods. The transient maximum air speed in the\nmodel studies could have been as high as 20 m s\u00021. This may be\ncompared with an estimated speed of around 3.5 m s\u00021 in the\nstraw pufﬁng study or about 2 m s\u00021 in the upright spitting and\nprone mouth exhalations, assuming a pursed lip and teeth\nconﬁguration providing an oriﬁce of about 3 cm \u0003 0.1 cm. The\nprone nasal study, assuming an oriﬁce similar to the straws, would\ngenerate a typical exhaled air speed nearer 2 m s\u00021.\nIn a separate unpublished study, we ﬁlmed initial blood droplet\nejection speeds produced by aggressive hitting of a hand-held\nheavy metal bar on a bloody surface designed to model the human\nskull. The study design and choice of weapon were determined by\nthe wish to replicate a possible alternative scenario causing the\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6.

comparative review highlights the relationships between the disciplines of bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) in forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences. In both the BPA and FD\ncommunities, scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air, or with other\nliquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of\nblood as a ﬂuid; the generation of the drops; their ﬂight in the air; their impact on solid or liquid surfaces;\nand the production of stains. For each of these topics, the relevant literature from the BPA community\nand from the FD community is reviewed. Comments are provided on opportunities for joint BPA and FD\nresearch, and on the development of novel FD-based tools and methods for BPA. Also, the use of\ndimensionless numbers is proposed to inform BPA analyses.\n\u0002 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n* Corresponding author.

    "text_chunk": "deﬁned class1 to which an unknown pattern belongs or conversely,\nclasses can be learned based on similarities between patterns. The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances.

    "text_chunk": "1. Introduction\nWhile the disciplines of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) in\nforensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) each have a rich history\n[1,2], interactions between these communities have not always\nbeen strong. From its infancy in 19th century Germany, BPA has\naimed for practical answers to speciﬁc questions of the kind: ‘‘How\ndid the bloodletting event of Fig. 1 happen?’’ FD was born in the\n17th and 18th centuries, in England, Switzerland and France. In\ncontrast to BPA, FD aims to quantitatively describe the motion of\nﬂuids (gases or liquids), and the causes of the motion, with general\nequations. FD typically deﬁnes the initial and boundary conditions\nof a ﬂuid system, and from there describes how the system evolves\nin time and space, most often in a deterministic manner. BPA\ntypically solves the indirect problem of inspecting stains in a crime\nscene to infer the most probable bloodletting event that produced\nthese patterns. In both the BPA and FD communities, scientists\nstudy the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air,\nor with other liquids or solids. The need for better integrating FD\nand BPA is mentioned in a 2009 report [3] by the US National\nResearch Council, entitled ‘‘Strengthening Forensic Science in the\nUnited States: A Path Forward’’. The report mentions that ‘‘the\nuncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are\nenormous’’, states that a minimum requirement to make BPA\ninterpretations is to have ‘‘an understanding of the physics of ﬂuid\ntransfer’’, and advocates for stronger scientiﬁc foundations for BPA,\ngiven ‘‘the complex nature of ﬂuid dynamics’’. It is our conviction\nthat the FD and BPA communities could beneﬁt from a deeper\nunderstanding of each other. Speciﬁcally, by following the path\nproposed by the US National Academies, BPA can obtain new\nquantitative tools and methods, while FD may be presented with\nnew ﬂow problems.\nNote that there are two overlapping communities in BPA: the\nusers and the researchers. BPA researchers, the speciﬁc target of\nthis review, evaluate existing BPA techniques, for example for\naccuracy; they also develop new BPA techniques. Their research is\ntypically funded by Governmental Agencies, run in Government\nlaboratories or in universities and published in journals such as\nForensic Science International or the Journal of Forensic Sciences of\nthe AAFS (American Academy of Forensic Sciences).Users of BPA\ntechniques study speciﬁc crime scenes, funded by the Police\nAdministration or when hired as trial consultants. Articles with\ndirect practical relevance, targeting users, are typically published\nby the International Association for Bloodstain Pattern Analysis\n(IABPA) Journal or the Journal of Forensic Identiﬁcation of the\nInternational Association for Identiﬁcation (IAI). A better integra-\ntion of FD and BPA might provide better, or simpler tools for BPA\nusers. Also, some of the ideas in the manuscript may be useful to\ninstructors for either identifying science topics useful for educa-\ntion of future practitioners or for contributing to the continual\neducation of practitioners interested in introducing more scientiﬁc\napproaches into their work.\nThis review is organized in ﬁve parts. First, Section 2 describes\nthe physical forces driving the dynamics – the motion and its causes\n- of blood as a ﬂuid. Then, the formation of bloodstains is described\nas a deterministic sequence of events, in separate sections on (3)\ndrop generation, (4) drop trajectories, (5) drop impact, and (6) stain\nformation.\nFor each of the ﬁve topics listed above, a summary and\ncomparative review of relevant literature is presented, ﬁrst the BPA\nliterature, and then the FD literature. The purpose of this\nmanuscript is to describe the FD themes and research topics that\naffect BPA. It is not intended to be a review of each individual ﬁeld,\nbut a comparative review of the overlapping areas to facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of potential inter-community collaborations. For\ninstance, a synthesis of the connections between FD and BPA is\nproposed in Section 7, describing how well the problems are\nunderstood and what opportunities exist for new research and the\ndevelopment of novel tools and methods. The ﬁndings of our\nreview paper are then summarized in Table 4, which highlights the\nrelations between BPA terminology (rows of the table) and FD\nconcepts (columns). It is our hope that this manuscript will be used\nto assess the state-of-the-art and to identify untapped research\ntopics at the intersections of FD and BPA.\nFig. 1. BPA uses FD-based methods to reconstruct a bloodletting event. In the above crime scene investigated by one of the co-authors, C.M., various bloodstain patterns are\nvisible, namely a pool (AE), transfer stains (AB), ﬂow patterns (AA) and several drip stains (AD). Elliptical bloodstains (B) indicate the area of origin of a blood spatter, see\nSection 5. For an interpretation of what happened in the photographed crime scene, refer to Section 8.\nD.

The bloodstain metrics for the 11 stains in cast-off \npattern 103 are displayed in Table 3.\n4.5. Pattern metrics\nThe pattern metric outputs for the three different patterns (impact \n14, cast-off 103 and expirated 9) are displayed in Table 4.\nFor the linearity, the centroids of the stains were plotted and a 2- \ndegree polynomial was fitted to the points (see Fig. 10). The measure \nof how well the points fitted to the curve were represented by the \ncalculated R2 value. The R2 values for both the impact and expirated \npatterns were very low indicating the centroid points did not fit well to a \ncurved line. The R2 value for the cast-off pattern was higher which is \nexpected as this pattern type is more linear than the other two which are \nradiating patterns. As not all cast-off patterns produced stains in a \nstrongly linear distribution a large range of R2 values (ranging from 0.1 \nto 0.99) were noted for these types of patterns.\nLikewise, both density measurements (ratio of the stain number to \npattern area and ratio of stain area to pattern area) is lowest for cast-off \nwhich is expected as this pattern has a smaller number of stains.

    "text_chunk": "experiments, there are some uncontrolled factors which result in\ntwo very different outcomes. Upon careful inspection of the high-\nspeed videos, it seems that the silicone-encased sponge in\nexperiment 7Db2 held more blood. Even more critically, the\nblood seems to have pooled to the backside of the target where\nbackward \nspatter \nwould \nform. \nTherefore, \nthe \npresence \nof\nbackward spatter in only one of these trials could simply be\nexplained by the undocumented blood ﬁlling process of the\nsilicone-encased sponge, or by gravity-driven transport of blood.\nRegardless of this deﬁciency, Fig. 3b still reveals the important\nresult of a faster average blood velocity for forward spattered\ndroplets versus backward spattered droplets.\nIt should be emphasized that the PIV results shown in Figs. 1–3\ndo not contain data with the initial velocities of the droplets. All\ndata points were taken starting at 0.4 ms after the bullet impacted\nthe target (except for experiment 7Db1 where data started at\n0.5 ms due to the inability to accurately resolve the droplets at an\nearlier moment of time – the early frames are completely blurry).\nThe analysis was only conducted for the time interval when the\ndroplets became clear enough to get accurate results. Droplets\nwere formed before 0.4 ms, but with the current high-speed\nvideos, PIV cannot be utilized to measure their velocity. The high-\nspeed videos seem to show at least two regimes of the expulsion of\ndroplets, the ﬁrst of which has not been measured by PIV here. The\nﬁrst regime is a very fast moving spray which occurs almost\ninstantaneously after the impact. After about 0.4 ms, the second\nregime begins to take place where the web of blood issued\nfrom the target consists of recognizable droplets moving at a\nmuch slower pace. An example of these two regimes can be seen in\nFig. 4 which is a frame taken from the high-speed video of\nexperiment 7Aa1.\nAs described in Section 2, the number of droplets was counted\nwith the particle analysis toolset of ImageJ within a region of\ninterest replicating the one used in the PIV analysis. The results for\nthe number of droplets in each experiment are shown in Fig. 5.\nFor the three experiments which contained both forward and\nbackward spattered droplets, there were always more forward\nspattered droplets. In comparing experiments 7Aa1 and 7Ab1,\nwhich differ only in the caliber of the bullet, experiment 7Ab1,\ncorresponding to the larger caliber, produced more droplets in\nboth forward and backward spatter. It also seems as if the\nexperiments with an open-faced bare sponge produce more\ndroplets overall when accounting for the experimental incon-\nsistencies of 7Db1 and 7Db2.\nUsing the particle analysis toolset of ImageJ, the side view area\nof each individual droplet can also be determined. An average of all\nthese values in each experiment is shown in Fig. 6\nFor \nthe \nexperiments \nwhich \nrevealed \nboth \nforward \nand\nbackward spattered droplets, there is an insigniﬁcant difference\nbetween the average side view area of droplets in the case of a\nbare sponge. The silicone-covered sponge in experiment of\n7Db2 resulted in much larger backward spattered droplets, albeit\nFig. 3. Droplet velocities for experiment 7Db1 shown in panel (a), and 7Db2 shown in panel (b). The red dashed lines with circular data points represent the results for\nforward spatter, and the solid blue line with square data points is for backward spatter. The error bars are the standard deviations of the set of data. Note that the data points\nare once again slightly offset from their corresponding time from impact value in order to more easily distinguish the error bars.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

Therefore, the decapitation must have been performed\nshortly after the gunshots when the victim’s heart was still beating.\nThe corpse had subsequently been dragged through the passage,\nwhich had caused the droplet and smear stains. In court, the\nperpetrator veriﬁed this reconstruction.\n2.2. Case 2: dynamic or static situation?\nA 52-year-old man was beaten to death with a metal pipe in his\nliving room. Autopsy veriﬁed ﬁve distinct fracture systems of the\nskull, each originating from a blow. The cause of death was cerebral\ninjury. A suspect who admitted to have killed the man in a ﬁght\nwas arrested. An important factor in the reconstruction was the\nexact location where the fatal blows had been delivered and the\ndynamics of the chain of events.\nThe corpse was lying in front of a sofa in a pool of blood. A panel\nclose to the head of the corpse showed a tight pattern of impact\nsplash stains (Fig. 2). This and abundant radial blood spatter stains\npresent on the sofa and walls indicated that the victim had not\nmoved. Contrary to all other objects in the vicinity, an armchair\nwas completely spared of bloodstains: it had been shielded by the\nbody of the perpetrator. This means that all or most blows had been\ndelivered while the assailant and the victim remained in the same\nposition. This is incompatible with a dynamic situation such as a\nﬁght. In court, the defendant admitted that he had taken his\nacquaintance by surprise. The man collapsed in front of the sofa\nand the defendant had delivered additional blows to the head\nwhile standing in front of the chair.\n2.3. Case 3: the sequence of events can make the difference\nA young mother and her two children aged 6 months and 2\nyears were found dead, each lying in their bed at home. A bloody\naxe was present at the scene and the three victims had suffered\nfatal brain injuries from multiple blows with this axe. The husband\nclaimed that his wife had ﬁrst killed the two children and that he\nsubsequently had killed her after he had seen what she had done.\nThe crucial question was the sequence of events.\nThe three victims were lying in their beds in separate rooms\nwith a large number of bloodstains present on the beds, the\nvictims, walls and at the ceilings. The wife showed numerous tiny\nsplash stains, among others, on the back of the left hand (Fig. 3a). A\ncot where the 2-year-old child had been killed had a defect in the\ntop rail of the bed frame made up of 3 separate notches covered\nwith blood (Fig. 3b): the perpetrator had struck the wood three\ntimes with the bloody axe.\nDNA analysis demonstrated that the blood on the woman’s left\nhand matched her own and that the blood from the notched defect\non the bed frame came from both the child and the mother. The\nlack of the children’s blood on the woman’s hand and the presence\nof the mixed stain in the notch strongly suggested that the wife had\nbeen killed before the children. Additionally, blood spatter stains at\nthe sleeves and pants of the husband originated from all three\nvictims, while the clothing of the wife only carried her own blood.\nWhen the husband was confronted with this evidence, he\nconfessed that he had ﬁrst murdered his wife and then his children.\n2.4. Case 4: the needle in the haystack\nA young woman was found severely injured lying on a driveway\n(Fig. 4a). She had been sexually attacked, the trousers and pants\npulled down to the ankles. She died at the scene from repeated\nblunt force to the head and severe blood aspiration. The head\nformed the centre of a blood spatter pattern present on the wall\nbehind her (Fig. 4a). Her clothing, including the jeans (Fig. 4b), was\nheavily covered with blood. Blood draining from the head and face\ninjuries, spatter and dropping stains, large smear stains and small\ncontact stains could be distinguished, and the skin of the hands,\nupper legs, and abdomen also showed blood deposits.\nThe police later arrested a suspect who had a superﬁcial tear\ninjury at the hand, and there was a chance that he had been\nbleeding slightly during the assault. Since the perpetrator may\nhave left small contact stains on the jeans, pants or shirt when he\npulled them down with his hands, a total of 60 stains were selected\non\nthe\nbasis\nof\ntheir\nmorphology\nfrom\nthe\nhundreds\nof\ndistinguishable ones for DNA analysis. Stain number 41 located\non the jeans was a tiny contact stain (Fig. 4c). This stain was the\nonly one analysed which did not originate from the victim herself,\nand the alleles matched those of the suspect who subsequently\nconfessed.\n3. Discussion\nIt is clear from the presented cases that bloodstain pattern\ninterpretation and autopsy are closely related. The type, number\nand location of injuries present in a victim are of great importance\nfor the interpretation of the resulting bloody scene. In our\nexperience, it is ideal when autopsy and scene investigation are\ncarried out by the same person, or when the scene is also visited by\nthe person performing the autopsy. Bloodstain pattern analysis is a\ntraditional topic of Legal Medicine in Germany [14], in countries\nwith a different tradition, close exchange of information between\nbloodstain experts and forensic pathologists should be guaranteed.\nFig. 2.

Incorporating machine \nlearning-based stain recognition, trained on annotated spatter datasets, \nmay also improve reliability at short distances. These enhancements will \nbe considered in future studies to improve the algorithm’s performance \nin challenging scenarios. Despite the challenges, the algorithm has \ndemonstrated high accuracy at mid-range distances and offers a clear \nframework that can be extended and refined in future studies.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, an algorithm for image processing and bloodstain \npattern analysis is developed considering its importance in describing \nthe relationship between the victim, the culprit, and the crime scene. \nThe code is developed to be capable of determining the approximate \narea of origin of the blood, i.e. the victim, by utilizing an image of the \ncrime scene including the bloodstains. This study differs from the \nliterature in the sense that it includes high-velocity impact cases such as \nfirearm related incidents rather than low and medium velocity impact \ncases such as blunt force trauma in which a lot of resources in the \nliterature are available [3,14]. The method that is employed in this \nstudy, called the tangent method, requires the impact angle of the \nbloodstains to be calculated. This is achieved via extracting the prop­\nerties of the ellipses that are fitted onto bloodstains in the images. With \nthe impact angle calculated, estimated source to target distance can be \ncalculated. Detailly discussed methodology is applied to a set of card­\nstocks that are obtained after the experiment. The experiment consists of \ndifferent source to target distances and different shooting distances that \nare (5 cm, 35 cm, 50 cm 100 cm) and (0 cm, 5 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, \n100 cm) respectively. Obtained 20 forward spatter bloodstain patterns \nare analyzed. It should be noted that the code requires user input for \nminimum and maximum ellipse eccentricities and areas. This would \nnarrow down the ellipses to be analyzed for better converged solutions. \nResults show that the algorithm performs the best in the source to target \ndistances that are 35 cm and 50 cm with errors to actual distances are \nless than 1 % in general. For the source the target distance of 100 cm, \nthe errors are still small as the maximum calculated error is 2.77 %. For \nsource the target distance of 5 cm, the errors are huge, exceeding 100 %, \ndue to lack of image quality and existence of extremely small ellipses. In \naddition, for each source to target distance, an optimum minimum and \nmaximum eccentricity value is selected. It can be concluded that as the \nsource to target distance increases, the optimum value for maximum \neccentricity decreases. Since at longer distances, the majority of the \nellipses have low eccentricity values due to high impact angles yielding \n90̊ , utilizing a smaller maximum eccentricity value would enable the \ncode the select the more circular bloodstains. With the same approach, \nas the distance becomes smaller, the impact angle becomes narrower \nwhich yields higher maximum eccentricity values, more elliptic blood­\nstains, are more appropriate. This study can be further improved via \nautomizing the eccentricity and area selection process and training it \nwith better prepared data sets such as wider range of source to target \ndistances and shooting distances that are photographed better. This \nwould help this algorithm and so does this study to be a go-to tool in \nbloodstain pattern analysis in academia and crime scene investigations.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nOcak Fatma Nida: Writing – original draft, Validation, Software, \nResources, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation. \nYalçın Sarıbey Aylin: Writing – review & editing, Visualization, Su­\npervision, Project administration, Conceptualization.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper.\nAppendix A.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁngering of an ink blot or a coffee stain is familiar to everyone. However, despite 140 years\nof study (Worthington 1876), the underlying rapid dynamics of the impact process eluded expla-\nnation until the past 20 years, when high-speed video technology began to allow time-resolved\nobservations of this intriguing phenomenon (Thoroddsen et al. 2008). The increasing pace of sen-\nsor improvements and availability is allowing the study of ever-ﬁner detail and is reinvigorating\nresearch in this area of study, as demonstrated by the large number of very recent references cited\nherein. This imaging technology is now reaching the diffraction limit of spatial resolution and sub-\nmicrosecond interframe times (Li & Thoroddsen 2015, Visser et al. 2015). This is being matched\nby increasing computational power and improved numerical algorithms to allow fully resolved\nsimulations in the axisymmetric conﬁguration (Thoraval et al. 2012), and fully three-dimensional\n(3D) cases, from ﬁrst contact, should soon follow (Agbaglah et al. 2011).\nWe strictly conﬁne our review to impacts on solid surfaces and leave out studies involving\nimpacts on pools or ﬁlms of liquid. Moreover, we emphasize recent works [i.e., appearing after\nthe earlier review by Yarin (2006) in this journal, which dealt with impacts on both solid and\nliquid surfaces].\nStudies of drop impacts are driven by several areas relevant both in nature and in industry.\nIn nature, a drop of water hollows a stone, and splashing produces aerosols, causes erosion, and\nbrings the smell of the earth during rain ( Joung & Buie 2015). In industry, there are spray/wall\ninteractions in coating, cleaning, cooling, and combustion. Inkjet droplets play an increasing role\nin fabrication, from the soldering of electronics to microarrays in biotechnology.\nFigure 1 presents some iconic images of impacting drops, including sketches by Worthington\naround the dawn of photography.

Results\nThe proposed ABPA method was applied to 132 cast-off, 208 impact \nand 132 expirated patterns that were generated in the laboratory as \npreviously described in Section 2, and the outputted results scrutinised \nby a trained BPA analyst.\n4.1. Segmentation\nAll bloodstains that were able to be visually identified by the analyst \nin the outputted image file were annotated by the method. This included \nvery small stains less than 0.5 mm in diameter. However some false \npositives were detected, such as staple holes and shadows at the edge of \nsome images. Any markings from rulers not completely cropped out \nwould also be identified as stains as would any non-circular pins present \nin the image.\n4.2. Comparison with ImageJ\nThree patterns from each class (expirated, cast-off and impact) rep­\nresenting a variety of different stains numbers, sizes and intensities were \nanalysed with both ImageJ (using the auto thresholding function) and \nthe proposed ABPA method and the number of stains identified with \neach were compared. As ImageJ did not have a minimum stain size, a \ncount of stains greater than 4 pixels was calculated for the ImageJ results \nfor comparisons which are noted in Table 2. It is noted that there was a \nbig difference between stain numbers for impact pattern 14 and expi­\nrated pattern 87 between the two methods, with the proposed ABPA \nmethod detecting more stains than ImageJ. When qualitatively \ncomparing the binary output of ImageJ with the pattern overlay output \nof the ABPA method it is apparent that ImageJ is not detecting all of the \nstains in the image.\nFor impact 14 a larger volume of blood was used resulting in larger \nand darker stains within the pattern. As a result, the thresholding for \nImageJ is not detecting the smaller and fainter stains (Fig. 6). Likewise, \nfor the expirated pattern 87, due to the blood substitute being a paler \ncolour and then further diluted with saliva during the spitting action to \ncreate the pattern, many of the stains are pale and these are not all being \ndetected by ImageJ.\nThe propsed ABPA method also coped better with shadows and un­\neven lighting. For expirated pattern 53 (Fig. 7) the shadowing on the \nlower portion of the image was counted as stains in ImageJ, and was \nlargely ignored with the proposed ABPA method. This is represented in \nthe total stain count of 8383 with ImageJ, reducing by nearly half to \n4773 when stains less than 5 pixels are removed. This is much more \ncomparable to the 4613 stains identified with the ABPA method. This \nresult also validates our decision to limit noise by having a minimum \nstain size of 5 pixels for the proposed ABPA method.\n4.3. Comparison with Matlab method\nThe impact pattern analysed with the Matlab method in [18] was \nmade available to the authors and was analysed with our developed \nABPA method. The proposed ABPA method detected 1623 stains of 10 \npixels or greater, much more than the 420 labelled elements identified in \nthe original research paper. The improved segmentation process is likely \nto account for the increase in stains detected, as well as the ability of the \nproposed ABPA method to count and measure all stains not just those \nwith fitted ellipses.\nOverall, the results indicate that the proposed ABPA method has a \nreliable and sensitive stain segmentation method that copes well with \nshadows and uneven lighting, and different intensity stains and is an \nimprovement on both the automated thresholding of ImageJ and the \nprevious Matlab developed methodology.\n4.4. Ellipse fitting and bloodstain metrics\nEllipses were fitted well to well-formed elliptical and spherical \nstains. However, as the method attempted to fit ellipses to all stains there \nwere times when very large ellipses were overlayed onto stains, \nparticularly for ones that had flowed, or were overlapping with other \nstains. Examples are shown in Fig. 8. Currently the only solution to \nremove these is to identify these stains using the user interface and \nTable 2 \nComparison of number of stains identified.\nPattern ID\nClass\nTotal stains \nImageJ\n>4 pixels \nImageJ\nTotal stains ABPA\n16c\ncastoff\n110\n98\n103\n103\ncastoff\n12\n11\n11\n133\ncastoff\n344\n233\n281\n14\nimpact\n2747\n1769\n3315\n13\nimpact\n442\n277\n335\n77\nimpact\n1144\n1090\n1133\n87\nexpirated\n241\n176\n575\n9\nexpirated\n11006\n7843\n7780\n53\nexpirated\n8383\n4773\n4613\nFig. 5.

Prior studies have demonstrated that the size and shape of a bloodstain on a smooth surface are\ndetermined from impact dynamics and to a lesser degree by the target material itself. Yet, these studies\nhave relied on clean surfaces, and it is unclear whether the presence of microscopic coatings and residues\ncould signiﬁcantly alter the size or shape of the dried stain. Here, in the present work, experiments are\nconducted to demonstrate that various coatings, such as the sebaceous residue from a latent ﬁngerprint,\ncan dramatically alter the size and shape of the stain from the moment of impact through the drying\nprocess. These experiments also highlight that a drop impacting a tilted superhydrophobic-coating glass\nsubstrate can cause the blood drop to completely recoil without leaving a stain. Relying on a combination\nof high-speed and time-lapse photography, the speciﬁc stages in the stain evolution responsible for the\ndeviations from the current models are identiﬁed. At a relatively low impact velocity, the stain sizes on\nthe coated glass surfaces were 35–72% smaller than on the clean glass surface. At a higher impact velocity,\nthe stains on the coated surfaces were not only smaller, but also contained drop spatter around the\nprimary stain that was not observable in the absence of the microscopic coatings. The reduction in\nbloodstain size did not appreciably change when a chemical was added to deactivate the anticoagulant\nand allow the blood to clot.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nFor over a century, blood pattern analysis (BPA) has been used\nby forensic scientists with the intention of reconstructing crime\nscenes [1–8] using the evidence in court to either provide missing\ndetails or to challenge or support a witness's testimony. In\nsituations where blood spatter is present, the size of blood stains\nare often associated with the force involved, whereas the shape\nand location of the stains can provide insight into an approximate\narea of origin [9]. Here detectives use a stringing technique to ﬁnd a\nregion of origin by assuming blood drops follow straight lines [10],\nan assumption that can overestimate the height by tens of\ncentimeters [11,8]. Within the last decade, methods have been\ndeveloped to back out the in-ﬂight parabolic trajectories of the\ndrops that account for gravitational and drag effects [12]. To apply\nthese methods, accurate estimate for the initial drop size and\nimpact velocity are required.\nNumerous studies have been carried out to relate the drop\nsize \nand \nimpact \nvelocity \nto \nthe \nﬁnal \nsize \nand \nshape \nof\nbloodstain [13–17]. \nThese \nstudies \ntypically \nrelate \nimpact\nconditions with the number of spines radiating from the dried\ndrop [13] or—in the absence of spines—with the stain size\nitself [15]. These relations appear to depend predominantly on\nthe impact conditions [16], with some corrections based on the\ntarget properties [14,17]. Thus, under the same impact conditions,\nthe bloodstain size might differ if the target were glass as opposed\nto polycarbonate. It is noteworthy that in almost all experiments\ninvestigating bloodstains, the target is cleaned before impact.\nHowever, at a crime scene, a surface may have unknown coatings\nor contaminants which may be invisible to the eye. For example, a\nwindow pane may be coated with ﬁngerprints, a kitchen counter\nwith a microscopic layer of oil, or a storefront with commercially-\navailable, superhydrophobic, anti-grafﬁti paint [18]. Here, a natural\nquestion \narises: \ncan \nthe \npresence \nof \nmicroscopic \ncoatings\nfundamentally alter the size or shape of the dried stain?\nThis study investigates the effect of microscopic coatings on the\nﬁnal bloodstain size and shape from the vertical impact of a single\ndrop of human blood.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

comparative review highlights the relationships between the disciplines of bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) in forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences. In both the BPA and FD\ncommunities, scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air, or with other\nliquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of\nblood as a ﬂuid; the generation of the drops; their ﬂight in the air; their impact on solid or liquid surfaces;\nand the production of stains. For each of these topics, the relevant literature from the BPA community\nand from the FD community is reviewed. Comments are provided on opportunities for joint BPA and FD\nresearch, and on the development of novel FD-based tools and methods for BPA. Also, the use of\ndimensionless numbers is proposed to inform BPA analyses.\n\u0002 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n* Corresponding author.

    "text_chunk": "<0.5 mm diameter with no indication of directionality. This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

    "text_chunk": "The simulation of the initial drop oscillation based on the TAB\nmodel and empirical data on drop sizes, properties, initial\ndistortion levels and rates provided accurate prediction of the\npassive drop behavior during ﬂight beginning from the moment of\nits formation.\nMeasured blood drop density and surface tension values were\nincorporated into the TAB model. Variations in the blood surface\ntension and density in the range of the instrumental errors had\nnegligible effect on the numerical results. The value of apparent\ndrop viscosity was selected from the measured and published data\n[35,36] by matching the experimental and numerical oscillation\ndecay times. The viscosity value of 10 mN s/m2 (for the shear rate\nof 10 s\u00041) provided the most satisfactory data ﬁt and was used for\nsimulations.\nThe maximum relative error in drop aspect ratio values\npredicted numerically to that observed experimentally was about\n1.6% for the ﬁrst period of drop oscillation which may be associated\nwith the errors in the assumed shape of the newly formed drop.\nThe empirical levels of drop deformation after about 0.5 s (or\n1.5 m) of fall were slightly lower (\u00025%) than those calculated\nnumerically with the TAB model based on the critical Weber\nnumber Wecr = 12 for shock loading [23,26] with Cf = 1/3. To\nimprove the agreement the value of Cf = 2/7, corresponding to\nslightly higher Wecr = 14, reasonable for a gradual increase in the\naerodynamic loading, was employed in the computation. The TAB\nmodel with Cf = 2/7 performed well for all the primary drops\nstudied experimentally. The relative errors in drop fall velocity and\ndistance between the numerical approximation and experimental\ndata was generally smaller than 0.5%.\nThe steady state solution (without drop shape oscillation and\ninitial \ndistortion) \nfor \nfalling \npassive \nblood \ndrops \nwas \nalso\ninvestigated. It should be noted that the deviation between the\nnumerical solutions for an initially deformed, oscillating drop and\nthe one for initially spherical, non-oscillating drop was negligibly\nsmall (<1/1000%) when predicting the evolution of drop fall\nvelocity, distance and time. This may suggest that the effect of\ndrop initial oscillation and distortion from sphericity on its ﬂight\ncharacteristics is negligibly small. Thus for all problems, other than\nthe initial drop shape oscillation prediction, a passive blood drop can\nbe modeled by an initially undisturbed non-oscillating drop\nundergoing deformation during ﬂight under the aerodynamic forces.\n7.2.3. Cast-off drop deformation and oscillations\nBlood \ndrops \ncast-off \nfrom \na \nrotating \ndisk \nserved \nas \na\ncomplementary validation case. Drop oscillations and deformation\nlevels were examined.\nThe cast-off drops studied ranged in size from 0.4 to 4 mm in\ndiameter and possessed velocities of 1–15 m/s. The uncertainty in\ndrop diameter measurement due to image pixilation and thresh-\nolding was less than or equal to \n0.11 mm for close-up images or\n\n0.5 mm for longer drop trajectory videos. The uncertainty in drop\nvelocity measurements was \n0.4 m/s and less than \n2 m/s respec-\ntively.\nA liquid mass adheres to the surface of the disk by interfacial\ntension forces. If these forces are weaker than the centripetal force\nrequired to keep it rotating at the disk speed, the mass will break\nup into drops which ﬂy off tangentially. Gravity also acts.\nThe blood deposited on to the lower disk surface was observed\nto move to and accumulate on the disk edge. As blood accumulated\nat the edge, the weight of the adhering mass and the centripetal\nforce required to keep it rotating with the disk increased. When the\ninterfacial force was no longer sufﬁcient, an adhering drop started\nto elongate and formed a liquid neck. The orientation of the liquid\nneck axis of symmetry changed during disk rotation and as the\nliquid mass increased. During the early stages of drop formation\nthe axis was oriented perpendicularly to the tangent to the disk\ncircumference at the point of drop contact. Later it further\nelongated and tilted from being perpendicular to the disk tangent.\nWhen the liquid neck narrowed enough it broke up in one or\nseveral places generally producing a primary drop and one or more\naccompanying or satellite drops. After the drop detached, some\nquantity of liquid was left adhering to the disk surface. As long as\nthe liquid ﬂow rate was sufﬁcient this liquid would undergo\nsubsequent similar stages of drop formation (see Fig. 11).\nAt lower disk velocities (up to about 6 m/s) the drops tended to\ndetach from the lower part of the rotating disk whereas at higher\nrotational speeds (and thus higher centripetal forces required for\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n0 \n0.2\n0.\n \n4 \n0.6\nAR\nTime, s\n Experime\n \nntal  dat a\nTAB model\nRaylei gh, 1892\nTAB model\n \n (no \n osc \nillation)\nFig. 10.

The three-dimensional\nregion of origin of a blood spatter is called the area of origin, and its\nnormal \nprojection \nonto \na \nhorizontal \nplane \nis \nthe \narea \nof\nconvergence. The area of convergence corresponds to the intersec-\ntion of straight lines with direction g, linear projections onto a\nhorizontal plane of the ballistic trajectories of the blood drops. To\ndetermine the area of origin, BPA experts use the angle of impact a\nfrom several stains using the visual inspection methods of Section\n5.1. This angle is the acute angle at which a blood drop strikes the\ntarget, see Fig. 7b. As an example, in Fig. 7a, the area of origin, target\nplane and area of convergence are respectively the region near the\nhead of the victim, the ﬂoor and the area on the ﬂoor supporting\nthe feet of the victim; labeled as a1–4 are the angles of impacts of\nfour drops.\nAn early BPA study on the relation between impact spatters\nand the area of origin is the graphical work of Piotrowski (1895),\nextensively reproduced and commented in [82]. The work\ndescribes among others the spatial distribution of stains created\nby a hammer impacting a pool of blood, and the blade of a hatchet\nhitting either a rabbit head or blood-soaked cotton cloths.\nPiotrowski observed that the orientation of the stains can\nindicate the origin of the blood spatter. Both Piotrowski’s and\nBalthazard et al.’s [42,82] work specify that bloodstain trajecto-\nries are not straight lines, a concept also reﬂected in the BPA\nliterature by mention of ‘bent trajectories’, ‘ballistic trajectories’\nor ‘parabolic trajectories’, to acknowledge the inﬂuence of\ngravity and drag forces.\nAs stated in 1939 in Balthazard et al., [42] ‘‘Le proble`me [of\nreconstructing trajectories] est tre`s difﬁcile a` re´soudre’’.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare.

    "text_chunk": "Research into the dynamics of fluids other than blood offers\nsome insight into this complex interaction (13–15). It begins when\nan object strikes a liquid source, transferring energy through com-\npression and forcing liquid displacement away from the strike\npoint. The amount of transferred energy will correlate with the\ndegree of fluid displacement. As the liquid undergoes displacement,\nthe ratio of surface area to volume increases. To counter this insta-\nbility, the displaced liquid will either recoil through counteracting\nsurface tension forces or disintegrate into smaller fragments where\nthe energy is great enough. Ultimately, aerodynamic forces govern\ndroplet size. The higher the velocity of blood displacement, the\ngreater the instability created at the liquid–gas interface, resulting\nin the generation of smaller droplets. This provides some support\nfor the current correlations made within the BPA community\nbetween bloodstain size and droplet velocity. Liquid displacement\nis quite complex, however, and not all of the liquid will be travel-\ning at the same velocity. This could result in a variety of droplet\nsizes, in addition to the generation of sheets and filaments. As\nblood has a relatively high viscosity when compared to water, this\nincreased resistance to flow will counteract displacement and\nincrease the probability of encountering sheets and filaments, as\nreadily observed in Fig. 1. Unlike droplets, sheets and filaments are\ninherently unstable because of their higher surface area-to-volume\nratio and will either recoil into a single droplet or further disinte-\ngrate into multiple droplets.\nOnce airborne, droplet flight trajectory is governed by the effects\nof gravity and drag (or air resistance). Gravity results in downward\ndroplet acceleration and can be modeled using the following pro-\njectile motion equations:\nyðtÞ ¼ \u0002 1\n2 gt2 þ voyt þ yo\nð2Þ\nvyðtÞ ¼ \u0002gt þ voy\nð3Þ\nayðtÞ ¼ \u0002g\nð4Þ\nvxðtÞ ¼ vox ¼ vo cos ho\nð5Þ\nxðtÞ ¼ vxot þ xo\nð6Þ\naxðtÞ ¼ 0\nð7Þ\ntan h ¼ vy\nvx\nð8Þ\nThe force applied to the body of a droplet in motion by the sur-\nrounding air is called drag and acts in the opposite direction of\ndroplet motion. The value of drag force can be calculated using the\nfollowing equation:\nFDrag ¼ CD\n1\n2 qairV2 p\n4 D2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\nð9Þ\nwhere q is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, and D is the\ndroplet diameter. CD is the coefficient of drag, which is a function\nof Reynolds number and depends on the shape of the object. The\nReynolds number for a sphere is defined as:\nRe ¼ qDoVo\nl\nð10Þ\nwhere D is the droplet diameter, and l is the fluid viscosity.\nThe aim of this research was to utilize a novel experimental\ndesign to investigate the error associated with the standard calcula-\ntions for AO. Starting with a mock crime scene experimental\napproach, the initial volume of blood was significantly reduced,\nand the disintegration process was propagated through the applica-\ntion of a short burst of pressurized air. These two modifications\nallowed for better resolution of the disintegration process to provide\na window into the underlying mechanisms responsible for AO\nerror.\nMaterials and Methods\nA gas tank filled with pressurized air was connected to a nozzle\nvia stainless steel tubing. A pressure gauge was used to measure\nair pressure, while a solenoid valve with digital pulse generator\nensured a controlled release of air from the nozzle. This apparatus\nwas contained within an aluminum frame structure to allow for ver-\ntical adjustment. Iron plates secured to the structure ensured it\nwould not move during operation. A diagram of this experimental\nsetup is shown in Fig. 2.\nA syringe, mounted within a syringe pump to regulate flow rate,\nwas connected to a stainless steel needle using clear plastic tubing.\nThe syringe and needle were clamped within the apparatus such\nthat a droplet suspended from the needle would be directly within\nthe path of pressurized air released from the nozzle. Pig blood was\nchosen owing to similarities in physical properties with human\nblood. The reader is directed to our previous article for additional\ninformation regarding these properties (10).\nFresh pig blood was obtained from an abattoir (Quality Meat\nPackers, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and stored in test tubes contain-\ning the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The\nblood was stored at 4\u0003C and was used within 48 h of collection.\nBlood was placed into the syringe pump, which was then utilized\nto deliver a specific volume of blood, resulting in consistent sized\nblood droplets suspended from the needle tip. Droplet diameter was\nmeasured directly from the high-speed images taken immediately\nprior to disintegration, using the needle diameter as a calibration\nreference.

    "text_chunk": "Quantitative bloodstain analysis: Differentiation of contact transfer\npatterns versus spatter patterns on fabric via microscopic inspection\nYuen Cho a, Faye Springer b, Frederic A. Tulleners a, William D. Ristenpart a,c,*\na Forensic Science Graduate Group, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA\nb Sacramento County Laboratory of Forensic Science, Sacramento, CA 95820, USA\nc Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA\n1. Introduction\nA correct distinction between bloodstain patterns formed by\n‘‘contact transfer’’ and ‘‘spatter’’ can be essential for the accurate\nreconstruction of events at crime scene where such bloodstain\npatterns are found. The Scientiﬁc Working Group on Bloodstain\nPattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN) deﬁnes a transfer stain as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from contact between a blood-bearing surface\nand another surface’’, whereas spatter stain is deﬁned as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from a blood drop dispersed through the air\ndue to an external force applied to a source of liquid blood’’ [1].\nAlthough these deﬁnitions are clear, the differentiation between\nthem is challenging, especially when the bloodstain is on fabric. As\ncurrently practiced, the interpretations of bloodstain patterns by\nbloodstain pattern analysts are mostly based upon the experience\nlevel of the analysts and the qualitative characteristics of the\nbloodstain patterns. Because of the analysts’ subjective analysis of\nbloodstain patterns found at the crime scene, however, experts\noften provide different interpretations of the same bloodstain\npattern evidence. For example, in Indiana v. Camm [2] the state\ncalled four expert witnesses, all of whom testiﬁed that some of the\nbloodstains on the defendant’s shirt were the result of high-\nvelocity impact spatter. In contrast, the defense called their own\nfour bloodstain analysis expert witnesses, and these four experts\ntestiﬁed that all of the bloodstains on the defendant’s shirt resulted\nfrom contact transfer.

Current methodologies, however, are qualitative and prone to\ncontext bias. In this work, we demonstrate that microscopic inspection of the stain orientations provides\na quantitative differentiation of bloodstains resulting from spatter versus contact transfer. Speciﬁcally,\ncommon knitted fabrics are comprised of parallel rows of left loop legs, in an upward diagonal orientation\n(/), and right loop legs in a downward diagonal orientation (\\). Our microscopic examination of more than\n65,000 individual stained loop legs shows that spatter stains are approximately evenly distributed\nbetween left and right loop legs, but contact transfer stains are unevenly distributed: depending on the\ntype of surface contacted, as many as 82% of the stains were preferentially located on the left loop legs. We\nfurther show that in these fabrics the left loop legs protrude further out than the right loop legs by\napproximately 50 mm, indicating that the observation of left loop legs preferentially stained over right\nloop legs is associated with the topography of the fabric. These ﬁndings suggest that microscopic\nquantiﬁcation of the relative loop leg stain distributions could provide an objective means of\ndifferentiating contact transfer versus spatter patterns in crime scene reconstruction.\n\u0002 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

To extract the maximum information from spatter\nstains, the size, velocity and direction of the drop that produces each stain, and forces acting during ﬂight,\nmust be known.\nA numerical scheme for accurate modeling of blood drop ﬂight, in typical crime scene conditions,\nincluding droplet oscillation, deformation and in-ﬂight disintegration, was developed and validated\nagainst analytical and experimental data including passive blood drop oscillations, deformation at\nterminal velocity, cast-off and impact drop deformation and breakup features. 4th order Runge–Kutta\ntimestepping was used with the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model and Pilch and Erdman’s (1987)\nexpression for breakup time. Experimental data for terminal velocities, oscillations, and deformation\nwas obtained via digital high-speed imaging. A single model was found to describe drop behavior\naccurately in passive, cast off and impact scenarios.\nTerminal velocities of typical passive drops falling up to 8 m, distances and times required to reach\nthem were predicted within 5%. Initial oscillations of passive blood drops with diameters of\n1 mm < d < 6 mm falling up to 1.5 m were studied. Predictions of oscillating passive drop aspect ratio\nwere within 1.6% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, the velocity of the drop within the\nﬁrst 1.5 m of fall is affected little by drag, oscillation or deformation.\nBlood drops with diameter 0.4–4 mm and velocity 1–15 m/s cast-off from a rotating disk showed low\ndeformation levels (Weber number < 3). Drops formed by blunt impact 0.1–2 mm in diameter at\nvelocities of 14–25 m/s were highly deformed (aspect ratios down to 0.4) and the larger impact blood\ndrops (\u00021–1.5 mm in diameter) broke up at critical Weber numbers of 12–14. Most break-ups occurred\nwithin 10–20 cm of the impact point. The model predicted deformation levels of cast-off and impact\nblood drops within 5% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, few cast-off drops will break\nup in ﬂight. However some impact-generated drops were seen to break up, some by the vibration, others\nby bag breakup.\nThe validated model can be used to gain deep understanding of the processes leading to spatter stains,\nand can be used to answer questions about proposed scenarios, e.g. how far blood drops may travel, or\nhow stain patterns are affected by winds and draughts.\n\u0002 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

    "text_chunk": "Heat exchange between a bouncing drop and a\nsuperhydrophobic substrate\nSamira Shiria and James C. Birda,1\naDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215\nEdited by William R. Schowalter, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, and approved May 18, 2017 (received for review January 4, 2017)\nThe ability to enhance or limit heat transfer between a surface and\nimpacting drops is important in applications ranging from indus-\ntrial spray cooling to the thermal regulation of animals in cold rain.\nWhen these surfaces are micro/nanotextured and hydrophobic, or\nsuperhydrophobic, an impacting drop can spread and recoil over\ntrapped air pockets so quickly that it can completely bounce off\nthe surface. It is expected that this short contact time limits heat\ntransfer; however, the amount of heat exchanged and precise role\nof various parameters, such as the drop size, are unknown. Here,\nwe demonstrate that the amount of heat exchanged between a\nmillimeter-sized water drop and a superhydrophobic surface will\nbe orders of magnitude less when the drop bounces than when\nit sticks. Through a combination of experiments and theory, we\nshow that the heat transfer process on superhydrophobic surfaces\nis independent of the trapped gas. Instead, we ﬁnd that, for a\ngiven spreading factor, the small fraction of heat transferred is\ncontrolled by two dimensionless groupings of physical parame-\nters: one that relates the thermal properties of the drop and bulk\nsubstrate and the other that characterizes the relative thermal,\ninertial, and capillary dynamics of the drop.\ndroplets | wetting | heat transfer | microtexture | feathers\nA\nn effective method to rapidly cool a surface is to intro-\nduce a stream of cold liquid drops, a process referred to\nas spray cooling (1, 2). Spray cooling is advantageous in appli-\ncations ranging from electronics (3) to cryogenic dermatology\nprocedures (4). However, there are also situations in which this\nrapid exchange of thermal energy with droplets is undesirable,\nsuch as in ice formation on the wings of an airplane (5), exposure\nto scalding liquids (6), or heat lost by animals with wet fur and\nfeathers (7, 8). Here, there is an effort to minimize heat exchange\nby designing superhydrophobic surfaces that can rapidly shed\ndrops from the surface (9–11). Indeed, a drop impacting a super-\nhydrophobic surface can completely bounce, leaving the surface\nbefore all possible heat is transferred. However, there is likely\nsome heat exchanged during the short residence time of the drop,\nand even a small amount of exchanged heat could become signif-\nicant following aggregate exposure to multiple bouncing drops.\nA similar bouncing phenomenon occurs when a drop impacts\na surface that is sufﬁciently hotter than the drop saturation tem-\nperature. Under this Leidenfrost or superheated condition, the\ndrop bounces on a cushion of its own vapor (12, 13), prevent-\ning direct contact between the solid and liquid and severely\nlimiting the efﬁcacy of spray cooling (14, 15). Models have\nbeen developed to predict the partial heat transfer that occurs\nwhen drops impact superheated surfaces (16–18); however, it\nis unclear which aspects of these models, if any, might extend\nto drops impacting on a superhydrophobic surface when phase\nchange does not occur. In particular, these models typically con-\nclude that the thermal properties of the vapor cushion determine\nthe amount of heat transferred.\nOur study addresses how much heat is transferred during\nthe bounce of either a warm or cold water drop on a superhy-\ndrophobic substrate in the absence of phase change. Record-\ning the bounce with thermal and high-speed cameras simulta-\nneously enables us to experimentally measure the transferred\nheat by a single drop over a short residence time. We use can-\ndle soot to create a superhydrophobic coating on the substrate,\nboth because it is a simple and effective technique (19, 20) and\nbecause the surface properties of soot are highly compatible\nwith thermal imaging. Soot, like other superhydrophobic sur-\nfaces, combines chemical hydrophobicity with micro/nanoscale\ntexture, a combination that can support signiﬁcant air under a\nwater drop (21, 22). The supported air leads to a large effec-\ntive contact angle and low contact friction, which together cause\nan impacting drop to rapidly recoil and completely bounce off\nthe surface (23). Indeed, if air escaped from the microstructure,\nthe drop would transition from a Cassie to a Wenzel state, and\nbouncing would not occur (24). Replacing the vapor layer in pre-\nvious superheated models (16, 17) with this constant-thickness,\nair-ﬁlled layer predicts the transferred heat Q should scale with\ninitial drop radius R as Q ∼R3.5. This scaling is different from\nthe relation that we ﬁnd for the superhydrophobic surfaces in our\nexperiments, Q ∼R2.75.\nWe propose two different mechanisms that could result in this\nscaling: one in which the heat transfer is dictated by a cush-\nion of air separating the drop from the superhydrophobic sur-\nface and the other in which the heat transfer is based on direct\nthermal exchange between the drop and the substrate. To dis-\ncern these mechanisms, we modify the substrate material in our\nexperiments and the subsequent results support the predictions\nof the direct contact model. We also demonstrate—on a bird\nfeather—an additional model prediction that, for a given ﬂow\nrate, a superhydrophobic surface can be cooled faster by small\ndrops than by large ones.\nResults and Discussion\nThe heat exchange between a drop and a substrate during a\nbounce is demonstrated experimentally in Fig. 1. A glass slide\nis coated with a layer of soot with average thickness δ ≈30 µm\n(Fig. S1). A hot water drop with radius R = 1.2 mm and initial\nSigniﬁcance\nA superhydrophobic surface can be so water repellent that\na drop can bounce off the surface in milliseconds. By mea-\nsuring the thermal interaction between a superhydrophobic\nsubstrate and a heated or cooled drop, we demonstrate that\nthe contact time is short enough that only a small fraction of\npotential heat is transferred, and, counterintuitively, smaller\ndrops transfer a larger fraction of their potential heat than\nlarger drops despite contacting the surface for less time. Our\nresults indicate that birds with superhydrophobic feathers will\nbe warmer in cold rain than those with feathers on which\ndrops stick, and we envision that a better understanding of\nthese mechanisms can inspire the design of superhydrophobic\nmaterials to control heat exchange.\nAuthor contributions: J.C.B. designed research; S.S. performed research; S.S. and J.C.B.\nanalyzed data; and S.S. and J.C.B. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion).

They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Traditional methods of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) rely significantly on the \nexpertise of professional examiners, which can result in limitations including low identification efficiency, high \nmisjudgment rates, and susceptibility to external disturbances. To enhance the accuracy and scientific rigor of \nidentifying impact spatters and fly spots, this study employed artificial intelligence techniques in image recog­\nnition and transfer learning. Two types of bloodstains obtained from simulation experiments were utilized as \ndatasets, and a pre-trained neural network, ResNet-18, was employed for feature extraction. The original fully \nconnected layer was replaced, and a new fully connected layer with a dimensionality of 2 was introduced to fulfil \nthe task requirements. The results demonstrate that the transfer learning network model, based on ResNet-18, \nachieved a maximum accuracy of 93 % in morphologically identifying impact spatters and fly spots. The \nobjective is to assist crime scene investigators and BPA analysts to identify bloodstains at homicide scenes \nconveniently, rapidly and accurately, thereby furnishing scientific evidence for scene reconstruction and \nadvancing BPA toward intelligent practices.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) employs a multi-disciplinary \napproach to discern the nature of activities and mechanisms behind \nbloodstains. BPA draws upon principles from biology, physics, and \nmathematics to scrutinise and analyze the size, shape, and distribution \nof bloodstains [1]. This approach has been demonstrated to be an \neffective tool in the investigation of crime scenes, offering vital clues and \nrobust support for crime scene reconstruction and aiding in case \ndetection during legal proceedings.\nSpatter stains are among the most common types of bloodstains \nfound at violent crime scenes [2]. These stains frequently form at the \nprimary crime scene and include subtypes such as spurt, cast-off, and \nimpact spatter [2]. Impact spatter is a type of bloodstain pattern formed \nby the impact of objects moving at different speeds on blood-stained or \nblood-containing objects, resulting in blood droplets splattering radially \nin all directions, which is of great significance for bloodstain analysts to \nanalyze the specific process of the occurrence of the case [3]. These \nbloodstains are typically circular or elliptical in shape, and their diam­\neter size is inversely proportional to the force of impact, ranging from \n0.01 mm to over 4 mm in diameter [1,3].\nIn certain homicide scenarios, when an assailant repeatedly strikes \nthe victim’s head with a blunt object near a wall, blood droplets may \nsplatter perpendicularly onto the wall, creating overlapping impact \nspatters [2]. The morphology of these overlapping impact spatters, \nresulting from multiple impacts, closely resembles the fly spots formed \nby necrophagous flies regurgitating or defecating onto wall surfaces \nafter licking blood [1,2,4]. On the one hand, fly spots typically have a \ndiameter of 1–2 mm, and exhibit a wide variety of shapes including \ncircular, elliptical, tadpole-like, and teardrop-like shapes [4–6]. These \nstains may occasionally possess a tail ranging from a few millimeters to \nless than 20 millimeters in length [4,5]. On the other hand, fly spots may \ninclude human blood that has not been fully digested, making it difficult \nfor presumptive blood tests such as Hemastix, Sangur, or Luminol, and \nDNA typing to differentiate between fly spots and impact spatter [4]. \nFailure to promptly distinguish between these bloodstain types at a \n* Correspondence to: Criminal Investigation School, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, 301 Baosheng Avenue, Chongqing 401120, China.\nE-mail address: forensicluzhou@hotmail.com (Z.

All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nCast-off spatters often occur during crimes involving beating\nevents. In the context of bloodstain pattern analysis, a cast-off\nspatter pattern is deﬁned as “a bloodstain pattern resulting from\nblood drops released from an object due to its motion” [1]. Cast-off\nspatters occur when non-gravitational inertial forces overcome the\ncapillary forces retaining blood on an object experiencing linear or\nrotational acceleration. In the latter case, the inertial forces are\ncalled centrifugal forces. Cast-off patterns are characterized with\nlinear or curvilinear stain distributions [2]. Cast-off patterns tend\nto be elongated, as compared to impact spatter that exhibit radial\ndispersions as shown in Fig. 1(a) [3]. Other occurrences of cast-off\nspatters involve water or mud projection by vehicle wheels. The\nscope of this manuscript is focused on spatters relevant to\nbloodstain pattern analysis.\nThe dynamics of cast-off formation have been well documented\n[2,4–9]. Blood adhering by capillary forces on a swinging object\ndetaches when centrifugal forces become large enough to balance\ncapillary forces. The detaching drops leave the swinging object\ntangentially to its swing, with an initial velocity equal in\nmagnitude and direction to that of the weapon at the instant of\ndetachment. The trajectories of the drops are then controlled by\ngravitational and drag forces. They can be described with Newton’s\nsecond law of motion. While several studies have described the\nreconstruction of impact spatter patterns [10–15], where the area\nof origin of the blood is assumed to be static, there is currently no\navailable method to reconstruct the trajectory of the swinging\nobject that generates a cast-off spatter pattern. Current recon-\nstruction methods for impact spatter patterns are called method of\nstrings or tangent method, assume the blood drops travel in straight\ntrajectories from the impacted blood source to the stain impact\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: scott.thomas.mccleary@gmail.com (S.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

This value can\nbe explained because the uncertainty in either horizontal direction\ngrows linearly with the distance xO as Dx \t xo, andDy \t xo, while\nthe uncertainty in the vertical direction grows as Dz \t gt2=2.\nAssuming a steady horizontal velocity u of the drop, the travel time\nt \t xO=u. \nCombining \nthe \ntwo \nlatter assumptions \nresults \nin\nDz \t gx2\no= 2u2\n\u0002 \n\u0003. \nThus \na \nrough estimate \nof \nthe \nuncertainty\nVRO ﬃ Dx \u0005 Dy \u0005 Dz \t x4\no. Numerically, the exponent of the power\nlaw in Eq. (15) is about ﬁve. Also, the assumption of Dz is inversely\nproportional to the square of the velocity, which indicates that\nselecting stains generated from faster drops might decrease\nreconstruction uncertainty. Note that in both spatter patterns\nreconstructed in the above ﬁgures, some stains pointing down-\nwards are considered, while these are typically excluded from\nheight reconstruction using traditional reconstruction methods.\nBesides the uncertainty on the determination of the region of\norigin, we can also determine its error. The error in the\ndetermination of the region of origin is deﬁned in the classical\nmanner [37] as the difference between the estimated and the\nknown region of origin of a spatter pattern. Here, it is calculated as\nthe smallest vector between the determined region of origin and\nthe known region of origin. Fig. 7 plots the absolute values of the\nhorizontal (dx) and vertical (dz) components of this error,\nassuming a probability P = 99%, as a function of the horizontal\ndistance between blood source and wall. Typically, dx is negative\n(the source is found closer to the wall), and dz is positive (the\nsource is found higher than it actual location). The error of the\npresent method, at least with the eight spatter patterns studied, is\nalways smaller than 10 cm, and does not grow with the distance\nfrom the wall. Although typically negligible in a crime scene, and\nindependent of the distance from the wall, the error is not always\nzero. This means that with the present method, the known region\nof origin is not always within the determined region of origin.\nPossible reasons for this are: the assumption that ellipticity exactly\ndetermines the impact angle (Eq. (3)), no matter the stain size or\nimpact energy; the equations of motion (Eq. (1)) that neglects\ninteractions between drops; the drag coefﬁcient that neglects\noscillations of drops, while considering their steady deformation;\nand the fact that atomization occurs over a volume rather than a\nspeciﬁc point. From the eight spatter patterns examined, it appears\nthat the present method does not exhibit a systematic bias or error.\nA comparison is made with a systematic study [38] on the sources\nof error in reconstruction using straight trajectories. Since no peer-\nreviewed results could be found for spatter patterns more than one\nmeter away from the wall, additional reconstruction results\nassuming straight trajectories obtained by participants to a\nworkshop given by the ﬁrst author are also plotted in green.\nThe data points obtained while assuming straight trajectories (in\nyellow and green) are averaged from several trials. In comparison,\nthe method of strings shows a systematic error in the determina-\ntion of the height: the determined height is higher than the known\nheight. This bias is well known by BPA researchers and practi-\ntioners [6,39]. Another contribution of the present method is to\nestimate the uncertainty associated with the reconstruction of a\nspeciﬁc spatter pattern.\nShould the above method be used on a crime scene, two\nrecommendations for crime scene documentation should be\nstated. Since the method relies on inspection of the stain\nboundaries, it is important to photograph stains with the highest\npossible resolution. In this study, a resolution of 600 dots per inch\nwas used. Using a macro-lens and a state-of-the-art digital camera,\nresolutions of the same order can been reached by stitching [40]\nmultiple images of small areas (O(10 cm \n 10 cm)). Protocols for\nreliable stitching and for quality illumination in the macro-\nphotography process – where the camera objective is close to the\nobject – would have to be designed. Also, the transitions between\nstain shapes depend on the blood and target material on which\nstains are found, which has implications in documentation and\npreservation of evidence. Until reliable calibration data is provided,\nwe recommend that investigators collect samples of the target\nsurface of interest and hematocrit measurements. Note also that in\na real crime scene, it is not uncommon that the blood source moves\nduring the generation of the blood spatter. That fact will add\nadditional uncertainty in the determination of the region of origin.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this study, we propose a novel method based on sound ﬂuid\ndynamics and a probabilistic approach to determine the region of\norigin of the impact blood spatter patterns associated with\nFig. 6.

With the assumption that\nthe contact line becomes pinned when the drop reaches its\nmaximum extent, the higher impact velocity should lead to a larger\nstain, as illustrated with bloodstains on the clean glass (Fig. 8, ﬁrst\ncolumn). If no contact line pinning occurs, then the stain size\nshould be independent of the impact velocity. This claim seems\nconsistent with the size of the bloodstains on the oil-coated glass\n(Fig. 8, third column). Interestingly, the size of the stain on the\nﬁngerprint-coated surface increases with the impact velocity, but\nis smaller than the clean glass, suggesting a contact line pinning\nthat is between the two extremes.\n3.4.

The method presented in this manuscript is about\nreconstructing the swing of the object causing the spatter pattern,\nbased on stain inspection and statistical methods.\nStudies on cast-off patterns have also produced reconstruction\nguidelines [2,4,16]. Recent advances in theory, measurement, and\ncrime scene processing have shed light on various aspects of cast-\noff patterns [2,16,17]. Two studies, by Maloney [17] and Liscio [16],\npropose methods for the analysis and interpretation of cast-off\npatterns. \nMethod \n[17] \nresults \nin \nthe \ndetermination \nof \nan\n“approximate plane of motion”, a plane within which the bloody\nweapon has probably swung. This plane of motion is calculated\nusing least squares and orthogonal regressions [17]. Method [16]\npresents and determines a “path volume envelope” (x10 [16]) that\nencloses the weapon swing. The path volume envelope is a box\n“deﬁned as the space which contains all or part of the object path\nwhich created the cast-off stains” (x8 in [16]). The method in [16]\nalso deﬁnes an “exclusion zone”, that is a volume where the cast-off\nspatter pattern is not likely to have originated. Both methods result\nin a plane containing the reconstructed motion of the weapon\nswing, which is supposedly planar. The error associated with these\nmethods can be estimated as the distance between the plane, or\nassociated planar region, and the known cast-off swing motion.\nHuman created cast-off patterns, commonly present on crime\nscenes, are not necessarily planar [2], and might involve multiple\nswings.\nTo date, there are no methods to directly reconstruct the swing\n(s) of a weapon from inspection of cast-off spatter patterns. In this\nmanuscript, we develop a geometric and statistical reconstruction\nmethod. The geometric approach determines circular segments of\nthe weapon swing from triplets of stains, which are then\nassembled statistically to reconstruct weapon swings featuring\nvariable radii and multiplanar motion. The reconstructed swing is\nrepresented statistically with uncertainty regions [12], which are\nvolumes of arbitrary shape that are likely to contain the swing of\nthe weapon. Analog probabilistic approaches have been proposed\nfor the reconstruction of impact spatter patterns by Camana [12] in\n2D and then by Attinger et al. in 3D [18]. The methods involve the\npropagation of measurement uncertainties and the construction of\na joint probability density function (PDF) [18]. The method in this\nmanuscript is analog, in the sense that similar statistical methods\nare used, however the reconstruction result is the path of a bloody\nweapon rather than a stationary blood source.\n2. Experiments\nFig. 1 shows the three setups used to produce cast-off patterns\nto develop and test the reconstruction method. One set of cast-off\nspatter patterns was produced with a sitting participant who\nswung a wet rod around his shoulder, and two sets of patterns were\nproduced by circular and non-circular motions of a wet rod. A total\nof about 20 spatter patterns was used to develop and test the\nreconstruction method.\n2.1. “Sitting” cast-off spatter patterns\nFour cast-off spatter patterns were created by the ﬁrst author,\nwho swung a wooden rod while seating, as shown in Fig. 1b. Fluid\nwas ink solution (Royal Talens Amsterdam green and red acrylic\nink) diluted with an equal volume of deionized water, and later\nswine \nblood. \nSwine \nblood \ntrials \nwere \nconducted at \nroom\ntemperature, 22 \u0002 1 \u0003C, with ethically-sourced heparinized blood\nto prevent coagulation. Swine blood was chosen to minimize\nbiohazards, and is a substitute to human blood with similar\nphysical properties [5,19,20]. The blood was drawn less than 24 h\nprior to experimentation and stored under refrigeration and on a\nrocker. Hematocrit was measured within the range of 44–48% prior\nto experimentation with a dedicated centrifuge device (STI,\nHemata-Stat-II). The blood was warmed to room temperature\nwhile on a rocker before experimentation. The reconstruction\nmethod proposed in this manuscript is independent on the ﬂuid\nFig. 1. Cast-off spatter patterns such as (a) have been generated in three ways: (b) participant “sitting” and rotating his arm, with measured weapon swing indicated in dashed\nblack arrow. (c) using a “Castanova” rig, where wooden arm rotates around ﬁxed axis driven by bungee cord, with measured swing motion as dashed black arrow; and (d) “\nhuman” participant creating a cast-off pattern during downward swing. Reference markers on the ﬂoor help calibrate motion measurement, and position trackers are\nmounted on the participant and on the bloody rod. The inset shows overlaid experiment video frames with the captured motion (in white). Tip of rod for each video frame is\nhighlighted as visual assistance.\nS. McCleary, E. Liscio, K.

Forensic science reveal testimony of these narrative, and among its diverse instrument \nblood spatter analysis stands out to be insightful. When violence occurs, blood doesn’t just \nspill—it moves, clings, sprays, and stains in patterns that speak volumes. These patterns, \nwhen carefully studied, can help reconstruct the actions, timing, and intensity of a crime [1]. \nBlood is a silent but honest witness. Unlike human testimony, it cannot lie, forget, or be \nintimidated. The way it lands whether in droplets, arcs, pools, or fine mist it always can \nindicate whether a victim was moving or still, whether the attacker was near or at a distant, \nand whether the violence was quick or prolonged [2]. Blood spatter reveals more than just \nphysical details where it tells of desperation, struggle and sometimes also can identify intent. \nThrough its patterns, investigators piece together a snapshot of the past. Blood responds to \ntrauma, but it also behaves according to laws of motion and surface interaction. Analysts \ngroup stains into passive, projected, and transfer patterns each offering clues about how the \nincident unfolded [3]. For instance, a pool of blood beneath a body may help determine the \nposition at collapse, while cast-off stains might reveal how many times a weapon was swung \nand from what angle. Time also plays a vital role. As blood dries, clots, and reacts to its \nenvironment, its physical properties shift in measurable ways. Investigators use this process \nto estimate when a crime occurred, considering variables like temperature, humidity, and \nairflow to narrow down the timeline [4]. \nThe above text has been proven countless many times having several examples’ cases like \nfor example A striking real-world instance of the power and limitations of blood spatter \nanalysis is the case of David Camm, a former Indiana State Trooper accused of murdering \nhis wife and children in 2000. Tiny droplets on his T-shirt were interpreted as high-velocity \nspatter from a gunshot, placing him at the scene. However, later expert testimony argued the \nblood was likely transferred through contact, not impact. After spending 13 years in prison \nand enduring multiple trials, Camm was acquitted in the year 2013 [6]. The case underscores \nthe need for careful, unbiased interpretation in bloodstain analysis, especially when lives and \njustice hang in the balance. \nIn the courtroom, blood spatter can support or contradict personal accounts. A suspect may \naffirm innocence but yet microscopic traces of blood on their clothing may suggest otherwise \nwhere the suspect might be proven to be the culprit. Conversely, the absence of foreseen \nstains can signal a staged or manipulated crime scene [6]. In this way, blood becomes a \ncritical piece of evidence that strongly supports the argument or claim speaking for those"

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis has several applications in crime\nscene reconstruction, informing on the sequence and timing of the\nevents, their mode of operation, and the location of blood sources.\nThe latter application is known as the determination of the region of\norigin and involves the inspection of bloodstains and the backward\nreconstruction of trajectories. Current methodologies for predicting\nthe origin of a bloodletting event rely on assuming that blood drops\ntravel in straight lines [1]. While simple, the technique involves\nintrinsic inaccuracies since the effect of drag and gravity on drop\nﬂight are unaccounted. These inaccuracies become signiﬁcant as the\ndistance between the origin of the event and the spatter increases, or\nin speciﬁc cases of downward projecting drops [2]. Several extensive\nstudies have also explored the uncertainty associated with an\narbitrary selection of stains or the values of impact angles [3–5].\nTo reconstruct the trajectories backward and account for drag\nand gravity, knowledge of droplet size and impact velocity is\nrequired [6]. These can be estimated from the morphology of the\nbloodstains, by e.g. analyzing their size, volume and number of\nspines [7–9]. In this regard, there is signiﬁcant literature proposing\ncorrelations between stain diameters, droplet sizes, and impact\nvelocities [7,10,11]. A few studies have also demonstrated backward\nreconstruction of trajectories [7,11], albeit without quantifying the\ninﬂuence of speciﬁc target properties and blood hematocrit. Blood is\nindeed a highly complex, shear-thinning, non-Newtonian ﬂuid,\nwhose ﬂow behavior depends on several factors such as: shear rate\n(or the impact velocity), temperature, hematocrit and humidity\n[12–14]. Hematocrit values in human blood of healthy individuals\nvary between values of about 40 to 45% [1,15,16].\nThis manuscript highlights the effect of varying target conditions\nin predicting the trajectories of blood drops. The experimental\nanalysis\npresented\nhere\nconsiders\ndripping\ndrops\nimpacting\nvertically on glass, cardboard, polycarbonate and aluminum targets.\nThe inﬂuence of target wettability and roughness is documented,\ntogether with the inﬂuence of humidity, room temperature, blood\ntemperature and hematocrit. The study also describes a process to\nmeasure the viscosity of blood and to estimate its variation with\nhematocrit and temperature. The spreading characteristics of the\ndrop, in regards to surface wettability and roughness, are discussed\nby generating individual correlations for each of the targets. Based\non the differences between correlations, the study quantiﬁes the\ninaccuracies\nin\nthe\nsimple\ntrajectory\nreconstruction\ntask\nof\nidentifying the drop release height when target-independent\ncorrelations or population-average hematocrit levels are used\ninstead of values speciﬁc to the case at hand.\nForensic Science International 266 (2016) 178–184\nA R T I C L E\nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 3 February 2016\nReceived in revised form 4 May 2016\nAccepted 17 May 2016\nAvailable online 24 May 2016\nKeywords:\nBloodstain pattern analysis\nDrop impact\nTrajectories\nHematocrit\nSurface roughness\nWettability\nA B S T R A C T\nTrajectory reconstruction from inspection of bloodstain patterns is relevant to crime scene investigation.\nWhile the inﬂuence of target properties on trajectory reconstruction has been often qualitatively\ndiscussed, it has rarely been quantiﬁed. Similarly, a few impact studies measure the viscosity of the blood\nused in impact experiments. In this work, the impact of blood drops is investigated on targets with a range\nof surface roughness and surface material. The maximum spreading is characterized using a spreading\ncorrelation, which relates the ratio of stain diameter to drop diameter with the non-dimensional numbers\nReynolds number and Ohnesorge number. The process for obtaining individual spreading correlations for\neach of the target substrates and for measuring the viscosity of the respective blood samples is described\nextensively. The error in estimating the drop release height, associated with using an impact correlation\nunspeciﬁc to the target of interest, is estimated analytically and numerically using experimental data. A\nsimilar analysis is done when the hematocrit of the blood is assumed rather than measured. Both\nassumptions lead to signiﬁcant errors in estimating the release height of a blood droplet.\n\u0002 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\n* Corresponding author at: 2036 Black Engineering, Ames, IA 50011.\nTel.: +1 515 294 1692.\nE-mail address: attinger@iastate.edu (D.

    "text_chunk": "deﬁned class1 to which an unknown pattern belongs or conversely,\nclasses can be learned based on similarities between patterns. The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Generating a reference pattern dataset\n2.1.1. Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap. A Nikon 36.3 MP D810 camera with a Nikon AF-S 60 mm\nmacro lens was used to capture the patterns. After photography, the\n4. Split dataset into training \n& test sets\n5. Feature Selection \n6.

All runs in Studies 1–3 were video recorded.\n2.4. Study 4: use of a simpliﬁed physical nose model\nThe above physiological studies, whilst containing the essential\nbiological relevance, were not entirely controllable or reproduc-\nible. Therefore, it was decided to devise an idealised physical nose\nmodel and experiment which, though it might potentially be\ncriticised for its extreme simplicity and remoteness from the real\nbiological situation, could be more clearly deﬁned and controlled.\nThe model (Fig. 1a) consisted of a short, 4.5 or 6.0 mm diameter\nplastic tube representing the nasal valve and more external parts of\nthe nose, connected to a large volume syringe representing the\nlung via a simpliﬁed representation of the nasal cavity (consisting\nof a ﬂat chamber of two parallel diamond-shaped Perspex plates)\nand tubing representing the major airways (Fig. 1b).\nThree drops of fresh human venous blood (total volume approx.\n0.045 ml) were instilled into the nasal valve, or nasal cavity, at one\nof the three positions shown (Fig. 1b). A controlled, small volume of\nair was then rapidly expelled through the system by dropping a\nweight onto the syringe plunger, depressing it in approx. 0.1 s and\ngenerating a peak transient pressure within the syringe of less than\napprox. 15 mm Hg. This exhalation of air always caused an aerosol\nof blood to be expelled through the nasal tube. Air volumes as small\nas 62.5 ml were exhaled from the model. This was not the lower\nlimit of volume capable of aerosolising blood, simply it was the\nsmallest volume tested; even this small volume produced copious\nspots on the targets. The resulting blood droplets were captured on\npaper surfaces placed horizontally 20 cm beneath the model and\nvertically at a distance of 50 cm (Fig. 1a). Over 80 individual\nexperiments were performed with the nasal tubes pointing\nhorizontally or inclined upwards at an angle of 308 or 458.\n3. Results\n3.1.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset.

As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

    "text_chunk": "<0.5 mm diameter with no indication of directionality. This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity).

Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec.

    "text_chunk": "2.2. Fluid dynamics description\nIn FD, a ﬂuid is characterized in contrast to a solid, and with\nrespect to some physical properties. What deﬁnes a liquid versus a\nsolid is the deformation in response to stresses like shear or\nelongation: solids respond to stresses by a sudden deformation,\nuntil a new equilibrium conﬁguration is reached, while ﬂuids\ncontinually deform as long as a shear stress is applied. Within FD,\nthe viscosity is deﬁned as the ratio between applied stress and the\nrate of ﬂuid deformation: the higher the viscosity, the higher the\nstresses needed for the same ﬂuid deformation (or ﬂow). Viscosity\ndissipates the energy associated with the deformation of a ﬂuid. In\nrelation to BPA, viscosity dampens the shape oscillations of drops\nin ﬂight and resists the spreading during impact. The viscosity of\nliquids typically decreases with increasing temperature.\nFor complex liquids such as blood, which contain suspended\nparticles, the viscosity changes with the shear rate (see Table 1 for\nvalues of shear rates representative of BPA). Such a ﬂuid with a\nnon-constant relation between stress and rate of deformation is\ncalled non-Newtonian. Blood is further classiﬁed as shear-thinning,\na speciﬁc class of non-Newtonian ﬂuids for which viscosity\ndecreases with increased shear. Indeed, blood appears more\nviscous when it drips from a wound than when it impacts a target\nat several meter/second. The viscosity of the blood also increases\nwith increasing hematocrit and decreasing temperature. The\nviscosity m of blood can be modeled from experiments in the\nform [16] of m = mrefg(H)f(g)k(T), where mref is the viscosity at a\nreference level of temperature (typically 37 8C); and the respective\nfunctions g, f and k model the dependence on hematocrit, shear\nrate and temperature, respectively. Other models do exist, such as\nthat given in [22], to describe the measured viscosity of human\nblood for shear rates from 2/s to 100,000/s.\nSurface tension is a force over a length, or an energy per unit\narea, that characterize any interface between two materials of\ndifferent physico-chemical structure, such as blood and air. Surface\ntension affects the drop formation process, the breakup of jets [23]\nand the oscillations of the shapes of drops. Surface tension tends to\nkeep the drops spherical in ﬂight since spherical shapes minimize\nthe surface energy [24]. This tendency of drops to assume a\nspherical shape is important to BPA, especially in relation with the\ndetermination of impact angles from the ellipticity of stains.\nRegarding the target substrate, the important physical proper-\nties are the elasticity, permeability, porosity, roughness and\nwetting angle. The elasticity E of a target is the ratio of the\napplied normal force per area to the resulting relative deformation of\nthe solid surface, called the strain. For example, microscopic\ndeformations of a rubber target during drop impact have been\nshown to inﬂuence the splashing of the drop [25]. The permeability\nis related to the ability of a liquid to ﬂow through a porous target. The\nporosity is a measure of the typical pore space available for a ﬂuid\n[21]. The roughness is a representative measurement of the\ndeparture of the surface texture from an absolute ﬂatness; it is\ncommonly expressed as Ra, the arithmetic average of that departure.\nThe wettability describes how a solid target inﬂuences the motion of\na pair of immiscible ﬂuids along it [26], for example water/air or\nwater/oil. In BPA, wettability inﬂuences the stain size and their\ndrying. In the case of BPA, the system of interest involves the two\nﬂuids of blood and air, as well as a solid target. The wettability of a\nsystem is illustrated in Fig. 2, and depends on the system chemistry,\nphysical state (cold or hot) and target microstructure or roughness. It\nis characterized by the wetting angle measured at the edge (also\ncalled the wetting or contact line) of a small drop on top of the target,\nreferred to as the static wetting angle. A small wetting angle (u \u0004 08)\ncorresponds to a hydrophilic state, while a large wetting angle\n(u > 1208) correspond to a hydrophobic state, as the liquid tends to\nbe repelled from the substrate. Note that the wetting angle\ndynamically adjusts its value when the wetting line moves, for\nexample during impact or evaporation [27].\nDimensionless numbers\nThe discipline of FD describes the motion of gases in extra-\nterrestrial space [28], the dynamics of atmospheres and oceans,\nand the motion of blood in capillaries thinner than a human hair\n[29]. To describe within a single framework events that span such a\nlarge range of time and length scales, FD relies on a three-step\nanalysis: ﬁrst, the magnitude of all the forces acting on the ﬂuid are\nevaluated, as in Table 2; then the relative magnitude of pairs of\nthese forces is compared using scaling or dimensionless numbers,\nsuch as the ones listed in Table 2, for example the Reynolds or\nWeber number; ﬁnally a more detailed analysis is performed based\nonly on the most relevant forces, neglecting those that are\ncomparatively negligible. FD methods for detailed analysis include\nvarious analytical methods (solving FD equations with pen and\npaper), numerical methods (solving FD equations with a comput-\ner), or experimental methods (for example high-speed visualiza-\ntion). On one hand, detailed FD analyses provide accurate\nsolutions, but can be cumbersome and mathematically challeng-\ning. On the other hand, proper use of dimensionless numbers result\nin simpler analyses valid for a wide range of experimental\nconditions, allowing experimental outcomes (stain dimension,\nnumber of spines, splashing versus no splashing) to be inferred\nfor cases that have not been (or can not be) tested explicitly. In\nother words, the ﬂuid dynamicist knows that two liquids\nbehave similarly as long as they are in the same physical regime,\ni.e. as long as they are experiencing the same ratios of forces.\nTherefore, what inﬂuences BPA events is not so much the\nphysical properties of the blood, air and target, or the velocities\nof the bloodletting event, but rather the balance between the\nforces at play, expressed with dimensionless numbers. Indeed,\nthese Reynolds and Weber numbers are not a way to express\npractical \ndata \n(such \nas \nvelocities \nor \nlength) \nin \na \nmore\ncomplicated way, but they help answer practical questions.\nSections a-c below illustrate the importance of dimensionless\nnumbers with the elementary BPA problem of determining the\nimpact velocity v of a drop with diameter d moving downwards\ntowards a target.\n(a) A dimensionless curve replaces multiple dimensional\ncurves: Let us start with the simplest experiments where a drop\nfrom a dropper drips towards the ground. Let us control the height\nh of the fall and measure the duration t of the fall with a\nchronometer or with a high-speed camera. Like Galileo [30,31],\nwe ﬁnd, at least for moderate heights, that h is proportional to t2,\nFig. 2. Wetting angle u on a hydrophobic target (a, such as an oily, plastic or waxed\nsurface) and on a hydrophilic target (b, such as clean glass). The wetting angle is\nmeasured at the three-phase line, which is the location where the air (A), the liquid\n(L) and the solid (S) meet. Drop impact and stain formation depend on wettability.\nD.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Green\ncircular markers were placed (prior to photography) inside\ndesignated regions of overlap, forming landmarks that were used\nto assist the digital stitching process. The latter process eventually\nled to the production of single TIFF-format images with a resolution\nof approximately 6.4 pix/mm as measured by ImageJ 1.48 v software\n[33]. To be conservative, it was assumed that a minimum of 9 pixels\n(3 \u0001 3) was required to resolve an element. This corresponded to an\nelement of approximately 0.22 mm2 in area or a circular element of\napproximately 0.5 mm diameter. The entire selection of stitched\npatterns was termed the reference pattern dataset.\n2.2. Classiﬁer development\n2.2.1. Deﬁnitions\nTerms used in this study follow those proposed by Ref. [26]. An\n“element” was deﬁned as a contiguous group of pixels in a digitised\nimage of a bloodstained region. A “pattern” was designated as a\nsubset of elements that were considered to be related. Both\nelements and patterns were regarded as having properties, for\nexample, shape, or size. The measurable part of a property was\ntermed a “feature”. Local features represented properties of\nelements and global features represented properties of patterns.\n2.2.2. Data import and pre-processing\nThe TIFF-format ﬁles that corresponded to the bloodstain\npatterns in the reference pattern dataset were imported into\nMatlab R2015b [34] using the built-in image reader, and then\nindividually pre-processed using the automated image-processing\nmethodology outlined in Ref. [26]. Each pattern was pre-processed\nusing \nthe \nfollowing \nsteps: \nbackground \nsubtraction, \nelement\nsegmentation, morphological operations, labeling and measuring\nelements, ellipse-ﬁtting and feature extraction.\n2.2.3. Feature extraction\nFeature extraction5 was deﬁned as the process of extracting\nquantitative data representative of properties commonly found in\ndifferent bloodstain pattern types (e.g. distribution of element\nshape).Inthisstudy, thesepropertieswere expressedasfeatures (see\nTable 1 of the Supplementary Materials) which were extracted using\nthe image-processing methodology outlined in Ref. [26]. This\nautomated methodology provided an objective method of analysis\ncomparedtothetypicalvisualassessmentof thefeaturesofapattern,\nby a BPA analyst. Feature extraction was performed on each\nbloodstain pattern in the reference pattern dataset and eventually\nled to values corresponding to 11 pattern metrics. A pattern metric\nwas considered to be an overall representation of a global feature in\nan individual bloodstain pattern. These values were eventually\nstored in a feature matrix (60 rows \u0001 11 columns) where each row of\nthe matrix (termed a feature vector) corresponded to a single\nbloodstain pattern and each value in the row corresponded to a\npattern metric. In pattern recognition literature, the 11-dimension-\nal space occupied bythese feature vectors is referred toas the feature\nspace [35]. The pattern metrics stored in the feature matrix were:\n1. Standard deviation of the tail to body ratio\n2. Mean width to length ratio (representing drop impact angle)\n3. Mean area of element to area of convex hull ratio (referred to as\nthe ‘convex hull ratio’)\n4. Mean perimeter of inscribed circle to perimeter of element\nratio (referred to as ‘inscribed circle ratio’)\n5. Mean element area\n6. Standard deviation of element intensity\n7. Standard deviation of the gamma angle\n8. Standard deviation of the orientation angle\n9. Mean Euclidean distance of elliptical elements to a polynomial\ncurve\n10. Circularity of the convex hull enclosing all elements of the\npattern\n11. Element density (i.e. the total number of elements in the\npattern divided by the area of the convex hull)\n2.2.4. PR dataset generation\nFunctions \nfrom \nthe \nMatlab \npattern \nrecognition \ntoolbox\n(PRTools) \n[36] \nwere \nused \nto \nbuild \nthe \nbloodstain pattern\nrecognition system. Using this toolbox, a ‘PR dataset’ variable\nwas constructed. This variable type is deﬁned as a complete\nrepresentation of all the pattern data that has been stored\nelectronically. The PR dataset consisted of the data in the feature\nmatrix, the relevant class labels for each pattern (i.e. ‘Impact’ or\n‘Cast-off’) and feature labels corresponding to the 11 features that\nwere extracted (i.e. ‘Tail to body ratio’, ‘Impact angle’, etc.).\n2.2.5. Deﬁning prior probabilities\nThe probability P(v) that a bloodstain pattern belongs to a\nparticular class (v) is deﬁned as the class prior [13]. In the context of\nthis study, there was an equal probability that a bloodstain pattern in\nthe reference pattern dataset was an impact spatter or a cast-off\nbloodstain pattern. On this basis, the class priors were set to 0.5.\n2.2.6. Training and test datasets\nA training dataset is a set of objects that can each be reliably\nassigned to one class and forms the fundamental basis of building a\nclassiﬁer [13]. A test dataset is a set of objects that is only used to\ntest the performance of a classiﬁer, after the classiﬁer has been\ntrained. 24 impact spatter and 24 cast-off bloodstain patterns were\nrandomly selected to form the training dataset (80%)6 while the\nremaining 12 bloodstain patterns formed the test dataset (20%).\nFig. 2. Camera setup on sliding platform in front of the Trespa wall where\nbloodstain patterns were created.\n5 In pattern recognition literature, the term ‘feature extraction’ can also be used\nto describe algorithms that create new features based on transformations or\ncombinations of the original feature set [35].\n6 The reference dataset was split according to ratios that are prescribed by the\nPareto Principle (80:20 ratio).\n312 \nR.M.

This\noccurred primarily on the sections of the yarns which were on the\ntechnical face of the fabric (Fig.10d and e, marked ‘A’). The blood was\ntherefore penetrating the yarns from the reservoir pooled on the\nsurface of the fabric. However, the high twist level of the medium\ncalico (756/756) compared to the heavy calico (650/624) impeded\nthe wicking of the blood along the intra-yarn spaces, resulting in the\nsmallest mean dry bloodstain area at each of these velocities.\nThe mCT cross-sections for all the heavy calico specimens at this\nvelocity indicated very little iron-rich blood in the centre of the\nbloodstain (Fig. 10g and h). Any iron-rich blood in the centre of the\nbloodstain (marked ‘A’) is primarily on the warp yarns, and the\nblood has not soaked all the way through to the centre of the yarns\n(Fig. 10g, ‘A’). This is possibly due to the higher linear density for\nthe heavy than the light and medium calicos. The blood dried\nbefore penetrating to the centre of the yarns, shown by the volume\nof dry blood which remained on the surface of the fabric (Figs. 9f,\nmarked ‘A’, Fig. 10i marked ‘B’), ﬁlling the inter-yarn spaces\n(Fig. 10i, marked ‘C’). At an impact velocity of 4.2 ms\u00011 it has\npreviously been found that no blood penetrated through to the\ntechnical rear of the heavy calico at impact, while blood did\npenetrate both the medium and light calicos [27].\n3.3. Impact velocity 5.1 ms\u00011\n5.1 ms\u00011 was the only velocity where the largest mean dry\nbloodstain area was on the medium calico, and the smallest on the\nlight calico (Fig. 3, Table 4). The difference in mean dry bloodstain\narea at 5.1 ms\u00011 was not statistically signiﬁcant (the difference\nbetween the medium and light calico was only 5 mm2).\nFor all specimens from an impact velocity of 5.1 ms\u00011 both the\nwarp (marked ‘A’) and weft (marked ‘B’) yarns were almost\ncompletely soaked in iron-rich blood (Fig. 11a, b, d, e, g and h),\nwhere the full shape of the yarn is seen (Fig. 2). Less blood was visible\non the surface of the yarns at 5.1 ms\u00011 (Fig. 11c, f, i) than at 4.1 ms\u00011\n(Fig.10c, f, i). As the blood was able to penetrate the intra-yarn spaces\nfor all three fabrics at this velocity, regardless of the yarn linear\ndensity, this would suggest that the increase in velocity to 5.1 ms\u00011\nenabled the blood to penetrate into the yarns at impact, ﬁlling the\nintra-yarn spaces. Evidence for a higher velocity forcing blood to\npenetrate into the intra- and inter- yarn spaces has previously been\nseen when passive bloodstains on a 100% cotton rib knit fabric were\nexamined using a mCT scanner [15]. In this previous work, the\nbloodstains formed from a velocity of 5.3 ms\u00011 reached their\nmaximum extent closer to the technical face of the fabric than the\nmiddle velocity (4.5 ms\u00011), with a mean maximum cross-sectional\narea larger than either of the other two velocities investigated in this\nprevious work (3.2, 4.5 ms\u00011) [15].

    "text_chunk": "Robust estimation for area of origin in bloodstain pattern analysis via directional\nanalysis\nM. Illes *, M. Boue´\nTrent University, Department of Forensic Science, Canada\n1. Introduction\nThe estimation of a blood source origin is one of the most\nessential pieces of evidence that can be extracted from a\nbloodletting crime scene. When a force is applied to a blood\nsource, single bloodstains will ﬂy through the air until striking a\ntarget surface. A bloodstain pattern area of origin is the three\ndimensional location of that blood source. Estimating the location\nby directional analysis consists of retracing the trajectories of a\ngroup of selected (upward directional) bloodstains that originated\nfrom this area. The trajectories are determined through trigono-\nmetric identities that relate the width and length of a stain (more\nprecisely, of an ellipse that is carefully ﬁtted to the stain) to the\nimpact angle of the droplet and to the glancing angle of the\nbloodstain (the angle measured on the wall between the main axis\nof the stain and the vertical) [1]. Once the trajectories emanating\nfrom each stain have been retraced, obtaining the estimate of the\norigin is a simple procedure. The x and y coordinates of the\nestimate correspond to the arithmetic mean1 of the x and y\ncoordinates, respectively, of all the points on the x–y plane (the\ntop-view) where the retraced trajectories intersect (see Fig. 1).\nWhen viewed from the side (on the x–z plane), and ﬁxing the x\ncoordinate of the origin, an upper limit for the z coordinate is\nobtained as the mean of the z values of the trajectories at that ﬁxed\nlevel of x (see Fig. 2).\nThe method of directional analysis as described above has been\nwell documented and validated in the literature (see [1–5] and the\nreferences therein). Nevertheless, considering the sensitivity of the\nmean to the presence of outliers, it is natural to ask whether the\nmethod can be made more robust by modifying the averaging\nprocedure. In this paper we focus our attention on two robust\nalternatives: the trimmed mean and a deterministic version of the\nRANSAC algorithm. We analyze and compare the performance of\nthese statistics under two different settings. In the ﬁrst setting\n(Case A), we consider impact patterns where all upward moving\nstains have been measured, and we take random samples of size 20\nfrom all of the stains. In this situation the variance of the\nestimation is greatly reduced for all patterns when using the\ntrimmed mean, with a small improvement in accuracy. Moreover,\nwhen stains were excluded from the samples according to the\ncriteria for stain selection identiﬁed in [2], the reduction in\nvariance was less pronounced in most cases, supporting the\nconclusion that those criteria can indeed help identify stains which\naffect the accuracy of the estimation negatively. We also study the\nmore realistic setting (Case B) where only a small set of stains has\nbeen deliberately selected and measured by a bloodstain analyst\nForensic Science International 226 (2013) 223–229\nA R T I C L E \nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 8 May 2012\nReceived in revised form 15 January 2013\nAccepted 25 January 2013\nAvailable online 19 February 2013\nKeywords:\nBloodstain pattern analysis\nImpact pattern\nForensic science\nStatistics\nDirectional analysis\nArea of origin\nA B S T R A C T\nDirectional analysis provides quantitative data supporting the three-dimensional estimation of the area of\norigin for impact bloodstain pattern analysis. The ﬁnal stage of directional analysis consists of calculating\nthe point of origin via the arithmetic mean of top-view intersecting points and side-view heights of the\nvirtual trajectories of single stains within the impact pattern. Given the sensitivity of the mean to the\npresence of outliers (droplets that have been inﬂuenced by gravitational force and aerodynamic drag), it is\nnatural to ask whether directional analysis can be made more robust by modifying the averaging\nprocedure. In this paper we focus our attention on two robust alternatives to the arithmetic mean: the\ntrimmed mean and a deterministic version of the RANSAC algorithm. Our results suggest that the trimmed\nmean is a practical robust alternative to the arithmetic mean, whereas the deterministic RANSAC procedure\nis not.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Impact and gamma angles\nThe angle of impact (θ), a crucial factor in bloodstain pattern anal­\nysis, refers to the angle at which blood drops strike a surface. The \nappearance of the bloodstain varies with changes in the impact angle. \nPerpendicular impacts produce circular shapes, while at more oblique \nangles the ellipse appears more elongated [12]. \nθ = sin−1\n(width\nlength\n)\n#\n(1) \nIn Eq. (1), “width” refers to the minor axis of the ellipse, while \n“length” denotes the major axis. In bloodstain analysis, gamma angle, \nknown as directional angle, is an important indicator to identify the \ndirection of movement of the blood drop with relative to a reference axis \n(typically a horizontal or a vertical plane) [13]. It is calculated by \nconsidering the orientation and direction of movement of the stain. For \nexample, if a stain is tilted at 45 degrees and the droplet moved to the \nright, the gamma angle is 45 degrees. If the same stain resulted from a \ndroplet moving to the left, the gamma angle would be 225 degrees (180 \ndegrees in the opposite direction). By looking at both the gamma angle \nand the impact angle, analysts can estimate where the blood drops came \nfrom before it hit the surface, helping to find the source of the bloodstain \n[12]. However, this estimation does not consider other forces like \ngravity and air resistance.\n2.4. Method for area of origin calculation\nThere are various methods in the literature such as tangent method, \nstringing, automated tangent method, least squares angles for analyzing \nthe ellipse models formed and determining the area of origin. The \ntangent method and string stretching are mostly manual methods [3, \n14]. In order to understand the tangent method, it is necessary to \nunderstand how to determine the AO. As a result of examining each of \nthe bloodstains formed because of the Impact Mechanism, the impact \nangle is obtained.\nIn the first stage of the tangent method, the intersection points of the \nlines drawn and extended from the major axes of the ellipses are \nanalyzed in a pairwise manner. Then, the intersection region is deter­\nmined, and the Y and Z coordinates of the AO are determined. The \nsecond stage is to find the X coordinate by applying the tangent rule. In \nthis stage, first, the distance Di, which is the projection of each ellipse to \nthe intersection region, is determined as shown in Fig. 4. Then, the \nlength and width of the ellipse are used to determine the impact angle \n(θi) [14]. \nAOy = 1\nn\n∑n\ni=1(Di⋅tan(θi) )#\n(2) \nAs shown in Eq. (2), multiplying the distance to the intersection Di by \nthe tangent of the calculated impact angles gives us the total distance \nperpendicular to the target surface. Since the calculated value contains \ninformation from all ellipses, we then divide the found value by the total \nnumber of ellipses (n) to come up with the X coordinate of the Area of \nOrigin (AOx) [14].\nNote that, Area of Origin in this case refers to a point since the Area of \nOrigin is defined as \"The space in three dimensions to which the trajectories \nof spatter can be utilized to determine the location of the spatter producing \nevent \" [13]. For the scope of this study, coordinates AOy and AOz are not \ncalculated intentionally due to the experimental setup. Since, the \nexperiment is set up in a way that the source is placed globally (AOx, 0, \n0). That means, the source is placed perpendicular to the origin point of \nthe cardstock. Thus, finding the remaining two coordinates other than \nAOx is an unnecessary effort.\nAs a result of each analysis, the estimated source distance is calcu­\nlated with supporting 2D graphics where detected ellipses and impact \nangles are shown (Figs. 5), and 3D graphics where the AOx is shown \n(Fig. 6). For convenience, details of a single case study in which the \nsource to target distance is 35 cm and shooting distance is 0 cm is \npresented.\nIn forensic practice, analysts determine whether the observed \nbloodstains are more circular (eccentricity close to 0) or more elongated \n(eccentricity close to 1) before inputting a suitable minimum and \nmaximum eccentricity range. Once these values are provided, the al­\ngorithm further optimizes the selection by prioritizing the most \nfrequently occurring eccentricity values within the image, ensuring that \nFig. 3.

Here, we explored accuracy and contextual inﬂuence in bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation,\nand how these variables might relate to analyst characteristics. Thirty-nine bloodstain pattern analysts with vary-\ning degrees of experience each completed measures of compliance, decision-making style, and need for closure.\nAnalysts then examined a bloodstain pattern without any additional contextual information, and allocated votes\nto listed pattern types according to favoured and less favoured classiﬁcations. Next, if they believed it would assist\nwith their classiﬁcation, analysts could request items of contextual information – from commonly encountered\nsources of information in bloodstain pattern analysis – and update their vote allocation. We calculated a shift\nscore for each item of contextual information based on vote reallocation. Almost all forms of contextual informa-\ntion inﬂuenced decision-making, with medical ﬁndings leading to the highest shift scores. Although there was a\nsmall positive association between shift scores and the degree to which analysts displayed an intuitive decision-\nmaking style, shift scores did not vary meaningfully as a function of experience or the other characteristics\nmeasured.

Introduction\nForensic science is currently at a crossroads. The reliability of conclu-\nsions about forensic evidence, and the methods used to reach those con-\nclusions, are ﬁrmly under the microscope. This juncture is largely due to\nthe much talked about National Research Council (NRC) report [1] into\nthe state of forensic science. This report highlighted the need for known\nerror rates in forensic science, and recommended that forensic disci-\nplines acknowledge the role of the examiner in the interpretation pro-\ncess. In particular, the report recognised the need for research into the\neffect of contextual information on the interpretation process [1]. Con-\ntext effects in forensic science are commonly referred to as contextual\nbias—a term that typically describes the unconscious inﬂuence of irrel-\nevant information on judgements.\nPrior to the publication of the NRC report [1], research into the\nperformance of forensic experts was sparse and had primarily focussed\non ﬁngerprint evidence [2,3]. This research highlighted a high degree of\nsubjectivity in ﬁngerprint interpretation, showing that ﬁngerprint\ndecisions are vulnerable to bias. Now, many other forensic disciplines\nhave faced the same scrutiny, with investigations into contextual bias\nbeing carried out in forensic odontology [4,5], handwriting examination\n[6], forensic anthropology [7], shoeprint examination [8], bullet com-\nparison [9], DNA interpretation [10], and bloodstain pattern analysis\n[11,12]. The general consensus from this research is that forensic inter-\npretations are vulnerable to contextual bias—a ﬁnding that is not sur-\nprising to psychological scientists, who have long investigated these\nbasic human decision-making processes [e.g.,13,14].\nIn response to this growing body of literature, forensic laboratories\naround the world are developing ways to minimise the potential for\ncontextual bias [6,15,16]. In Australia, for example, the Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department has introduced a system of contextual\ninformation management for handwriting examinations [6]. Here, a\ndesignated context manager removes all irrelevant contextual details\nbefore passing the document on to be examined. Consequently, there\nis minimal chance for irrelevant contextual details to cloud judgement.\nImplementing this type of bias-minimising procedure would also be\nrelatively uncomplicated for many other forensic disciplines, such as\nﬁngerprint interpretation, shoeprint examination, and DNA interpreta-\ntion. The interpretation of such evidence requires minimal to no\nadditional contextual information, and most or all contextual details\ncan be removed.\nNot all forensic disciplines, however, are presented with such a\nstraightforward solution to eliminating the negative effects of context.\nScience and Justice 56 (2016) 123–128\n⁎ Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: nosborne@psy.otago.ac.nz (N.K.P.

The analysis\nprocess utilized particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle analysis software to measure drop\nvelocities as well as the distributions of the number of droplets and their respective side view area. The\nresults of this analysis revealed that the maximal velocity in the forward spatter can be about 47 \u0001 5 m/s\nand for the backward spatter – about 24 \u0001 8 m/s. Moreover, our measurements indicate that the number\nof droplets produced is larger in forward spatter than it is in backward spatter.

It is an aqueous suspension which contains\nplasma and particles such as white and red blood cells, and\nplatelets. Blood starts to coagulate when it leaves the body or\nunder conditions of increased shear stress [13]. The rheology of\nblood could affect the atomization process [14–16] which is of\nfundamental importance for BPA because it determines the\ndistribution of drop sizes and velocities [17], thus the resulting\nblood spatter. The atomization is diminished by the effects of\nviscoelasticity [18–20], and the resulting size of the impacting\ndroplets can be heavily inﬂuenced by viscosity and elasticity of\nliquid [21–26]. Therefore, an accurate crime scene reconstruction\nfrom any crime involving blood spatter must account for the\nrheological behavior of blood.\nThe uncertainties of different BPA techniques can be signiﬁcant,\nup to a 50% overestimation of the height of the origin of a blood\nspatter [5]. A better understanding of the mechanisms of\nblood droplet formation and ﬂight is required. The ﬁrst theoretical\nsteps in this direction are already available [27].

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

The blood coated the warp and weft yarns (Fig.13d and\ne, marked ‘A’) rather than penetrating through to the centre of\nthem. Therefore, the blood on the technical rear of the medium\ncalico was forced through the inter-yarn spaces and around the\nyarns at impact, as the higher twist level of the medium calico\nreduced the ability of the blood to penetrate into the yarns\nthemselves. Some blood also remained pooled on the surface of the\nmedium calico (Fig. 13b). The blood on the surface dried before\nbeing able to fully wick into the intra-yarn spaces, therefore\nreducing the amount of wicking which occurred along them. The\ngreater yarn twist of the medium than the heavy and the light\ncalicos reduced the ability of the blood to wick into and along the\nintra-yarn spaces, reducing the dry bloodstain area.\nFor the heavy, as for the medium calico, iron-rich blood coated\nboth the warp and weft yarns (Fig. 14g and h), although blood did\nnot completely penetrate through to the technical rear of the fabric\n(compare Fig. 13i–h). The blood remained more on the surface of\nthe heavy calico than either the medium or light calicos owing to\nthe higher yarn linear density. This is evidenced by a greater\namount of iron-rich blood towards the technical face of the fabric\nin the mCT cross-sections (Fig. 14g and h) and the ring of dense\nblood which occurred on the surface of the fabric (Fig. 13l).\nTherefore, with the increase in impact velocity to 5.4 ms\u00011 the\nblood spread laterally across the surface of the heavy calico, as\nopposed to penetrating through to the technical rear of the fabric\nas for the medium calico. This resulted in a larger mean dry\nbloodstain area for the heavy than the medium calico.\n3.5.

The light calico generally had\nthe largest mean dry bloodstain area but had a lower correlation\nwith velocity. This was due to the low yarn linear density of the\nlight calico which reduced the volume the blood had to ﬁll;\ntherefore the blood wicked further along the yarns.

Note that the elongated shape of some stains in (a) is mostly due to the angle of impact, rather than due\nto the drop sliding down the surface after impact.\nHere ρ and σ are the density and surface tension of blood, respectively, and Rei is the drop\nReynolds number from the ﬁrst part of Eq. (45). The impact velocity ui,impact is taken as the velocity\nmagnitude, not the component that is normal to the impacted surface. The reason for this is that\nthe normal component of velocity, UH for the horizontal deposition case, is largely due to the\nrelatively large impact angles. These large angles mean that drops impact practically vertically and\nthe stain should be almost circular. This is opposite of the vertical deposition cases where the normal\ncomponent of velocity is UV , which is small and the trajectory hits a vertical substrate tangentially\ncreating elliptic stains. Therefore, the spread factor of Eq. (52) can be greatly underestimated if\nnormal velocity components are used for the vertical deposition cases, since UV is much smaller\nthan UH. Experimental evidence supports the idea of using the impact velocity magnitude in Eqs. (52)\nand (53), since large elliptical stains are associated with the tangential velocity component, as Fig. 5\nand [38] show. It should be emphasized that the relation between the ellipticity of bloodstains and\ntheir immediate deformation upon impact is known in forensic literature [4,6,7,11]. A comparison\nbetween computational ﬂuid dynamics and high-speeed visualization of the deformation stages and\nﬁnal stain shape during oblique impact of blood drops is shown in Fig. 10 of [3]. As a matter of\nfact, there is a plausible relationship between the ellipticity of the stain and the angle of impact\n[3,4,6,7,11]. It should be emphasized that in the present experiments sufﬁcient experimental data\nwere collected only on the horizontal surface (the ﬂoor), therefore, only this case is discussed here.\nSeveral governing parameters characteristic of the experiment, namely, bullet velocity and\npenetration depth into blood at the moment of backward splashing, as well as the semiangle of\nthe bullet cone that changes during the impact of a hollow-point bullet (such as the one used here)\nare known only with an order-of-magnitude accuracy. Therefore, a single set of these parameters\nwas chosen to uniformly match the horizontal data sets in the trial H-a0-D300, i.e., the data collected\non the ﬂoor along the bullet trajectory when shooting was horizontal and parallel to the ﬂoor. The\nparameters found from this matching were the bullet impact velocity V0 ≈300 m/s, semiangle of\nthe bullet cone θ ≈0.16 rad (∼9°), the depth of the bullet penetration corresponding to the main\nblood splash h ≈1 cm, the dimensionless factor in Eq. (22) w = 0.9, and the dimensionless factor\nin Eq. (24) c = 0.001. For both sets of comparisons this set of parameters was kept unchanged.\nNote also that the azimuthal angle over the cross section of the bullet \t was set to increment at π/2\naround the entire cone.\nThe bins bi ⩽r/h ⩽bi+1 were chosen to be equal, since the majority of the drops inevitably\nresult from a few bins sufﬁciently close to the line of the bullet intersection with the free surface\nencompassing the blood mass. Thus, the choice of these bins, rather than their different widths, was\ncarefully explored in the preliminary simulations.\n043201-14"

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Luminol chemical and physical properties and\nchemiluminescence\nLuminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazine-dione) is a\ncyclic acyl-hydrazide, and shows the typical reactivity of\nthis class of compounds [32]. Beyond the common chem-\nical, physical and toxicological characteristics which are\nsuccinctly described in Table 1 [9,33] and are also available\nat The National Toxicology Program (The National Insti-\ntute of Environmental Health Sciences, NC, USA) website\n(http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm)1, luminol presents some\n1 The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services. The National Toxicology Program is headquartered on the\nNIEHS campus in Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.\nproperties which are especially relevant when it is used for\nforensic purposes: photo- and thermal-stability and chemical\nbehaviour in protic polar media.\nLuminol solutions are sensitive to light and the presence of\nmetal cations; typically they are only stable 8–12 h. Luminol\nwas shown to be thermally unstable, so luminol and its solutions\nshould be protected from high temperature [34].\nTwo separate pKa values (6.74 and 15.1), corresponding to\nloss of the two acyl-hydrazide protons, at (pKa1) and (pKa2)\nhave been found [35–37]. Thus in aqueous solution phase lumi-\nnol (LH2) can be found in the fully protonated form in acidic\nsolutions while, when dissolved in a basic solution, above about\npH 7, dissociations to the monoanion (LH−) and dianion (L2−)\noccur. The fully-protonated and monodeprotonated (monoan-\nionic) forms of luminol can undergo keto-enolic tautomerisation\nin solution and the solid state [16,32,37] (Fig. 3), although most\nauthors (including us) represent these compounds with the pro-\ntons on the nitrogens.\nLuminol chemiluminescence has recently been reviewed by\nBarnett and Francis [5]. The light-producing pathway for the\noxidation of luminol is a complex multi-step process and is\ndependent on several factors including pH, temperature and\nionic strength of the reaction medium and reactive species that\ncan be present in solution and interact with luminol, metal cat-\nalyst or hydroxide ions [5].\nWhite et al. observed that the ﬂuorescence spectrum of an\nintermediate molecule in the luminol oxidation process named\n3-aminophthalate in an electronically excited state (3-APA*)\nperfectly matched the chemiluminescence spectrum of luminol,\nthus they concluded that this excited intermediate could be con-\nsideredthelightemittingspeciesupondeexcitationtotheground\nstate (3-APA) [38–40].

First, how does the disparity in stained\nleft versus right loop legs vary with height asymmetry? Here we\nexamined only two fabrics, so a more comprehensive survey of\nmany fabric types would be helpful to develop a quantitative\ncorrelation. Second, we performed the contact transfer as soon as\npossible after spraying the blood onto the donor surface (glass or\nleather), but if the blood is left to evaporate for some time then its\nphysical properties (e.g., viscosity and interfacial tension) will\nchange. ‘‘Drier’’ blood will likely also yield discrepancy between\nstained left and right loop legs, but quantitative corroboration is\nnecessary. Third, we performed all contact transfer in this study\nsimply by pressing the fabric onto the donor surface by hand, using\n(to the best of our ability) the same applied force each time. Given\nour proposed mechanism, a possibility worth investigating is that\nthe pressure exerted during the contact transfer could alter the\nmicroscopic distribution of stained loop legs. For example one\npossible hypothesis is that a low application of force (i.e., a ‘light\npush’) yields a higher discrepancy between left and right loop legs\nbecause the recessed legs fail to reach the drops, whereas a high\napplication of force (i.e., a ‘heavy push’) minimizes the discrepancy\nby bringing the recessed loop legs in closer contact with the drops.\nLikewise, this study restricted attention to contact transfer\nperformed by applying pressure to the fabric normally (orthogo-\nnally) to the donor surface; the effect of shearing motions (i.e.,\n‘brushing or swiping’) tangential to the donor surface remain to be\nexamined. The present study will serve as a framework to address\nthese more complicated questions, and help put bloodstain pattern\nanalysis on a more quantitative footing.\nAcknowledgments\nSupport for this research was provided by the National Institute\nof Justice (Award No. 2010-DN-BX-K039).

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

The\nsame routine was employed to ﬁnd the solution of the equations\nfor the drop Cartesian coordinates. The computing time required\nfor each simulation was typically 10 s with the time step\nDt = 10\u00043–10\u00045 s. The time step was determined based on a\nsolution convergence criterion of six orders of magnitude (10\u00046).\nFor drop oscillations modeling each period of oscillations (T) was\nrepresented by at least 100 time steps (Dt = T/100).\n4. Drop deformation models\nThe blood drop was considered to deform into an oblate or\nprolate spheroid (ellipsoid of revolution about its minor or major\naxes) [20] when subjected to a deforming aerodynamic force\n(Fig. 3).\nThe level of drop deformation during ﬂight is believed to be\ninﬂuenced by both the intensity and the rate of change of the\napplied aerodynamic forces. A drop responds differently in the case\nof slow, gradual loading (as in free fall), compared to sudden or\nimpulsive loading (e.g. shock wave disturbance).\nIn practice, the aerodynamic loading of the drop varies as its\nrelative velocity changes during accelerated motion. In light of this\nthree alternative models for the modeling of drop distortion during\nﬂight were incorporated in the present scheme.\nTwo of these included correlations for the aspect ratio of a\ndeformed drop (AR), as a measure of its distortion, at steady\nterminal conditions, when drag force on a drop is balanced by its\nweight \nwith \neither \nAR ¼ ½4=17ðð17Bo=4Þ þ 1Þ1=2 þ ð13=17Þ\u0005\n\u00043=2\n[28], where Bo ¼ rgd2\n0=4s; or AR ¼ ð1 þ 0:07We1=2Þ\n\u00043 [23] with\nWe ¼ rairV2\nreldo=s.\nThe models were assumed to be suitable for relatively large\ndrops that are moving with velocities lower than their terminal\nvelocities (e.g. passive drops) as an extreme case of maximum\npossible deformation.\nThe third model for drop deformation was based on the Taylor\nAnalogy Breakup (TAB) model for low-Weber number sprays [29].\nThe model is based on an analogy between an oscillating and\nπ\ny\nz\nx\nv 0y\n \nv 0x \nv 0z \nγ0 \nβ 0 \nα 0\nH \nL\nZ \n,\nz\ny \nx\nd0 \nFig. 2.

The majority of blood drops imaged in the course of this study\nﬁtted these criteria. Lift force is important for the case of irregularly deformed drops\nand rotational motion.\n3 In general, for a particle during its accelerating (transient) motion, the\nadditional virtual mass force and Bassett history force should also be considered\n[60]. However, due to the relatively high density ratio of blood (or water) to that of\nair (831 < r/rair < 880) the virtual mass term may be neglected. The Basset history\nterm is not generally negligible, however, due to its complexity, difﬁculty in\nimplementation and more pronounced effects for the movement at high\nacceleration, it was not considered. Evaluation of the magnitude of Basset force\nin different multiphase ﬂow applications can be found in Liang and Michaelides\n[61]. These authors found that the Basset force may be neglected in the particle\nequation of motion only when the ﬂuid to particle density ratio is very high (gas\nbubbles in liquids) and the particle diameter is greater than 1 mm. For movement\nwith high acceleration however, the Basset term can exceed the Stokes’ term by as\nmuch as a factor of two. These conditions are not thought to be met for typical BPA\ndrops.\nN.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface.

This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

Horse blood was\ndropped vertically onto three calico fabrics with different mass per unit areas (85.1 g/m2, 163.5 g/m2 and\n224.6 g/m2). Six different impact velocities were used (1.7 ms\u00011, 2.9 ms\u00011, 4.1 ms\u00011, 4.9 ms\u00011, 5.1 ms\u00011 and\n5.4 ms\u00011). The dry bloodstains were largest on the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. The low\nyarn linear density and large inter-yarn spaces meant that the blood could wick into the yarns from all\ndirections and along the intra-yarn spaces. The calico with the middle mass per unit area had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area for four out of the six velocities. The twist level for this calico was greater than\nfor the calicos with a heavier or lighter mass per unit area. This reduced the amount of wicking which\noccurred along the yarns due to the tighter yarn structure. The calico with the heaviest mass per unit area\nhad the highest yarn linear density resulting in a thicker fabric, so the blood could not as easily penetrate\ninto the fabric. This resulted in a thicker wet blood layer remaining on the fabric surface, where it\ngradually wicked vertically into the yarns under gravity. Less wicking along the yarns occurred, resulting\nin a smaller bloodstain than on the fabric with the lightest mass per unit area. The correlation between\nimpact velocity and mean dry bloodstain area was greater for the calicos with the medium and heaviest\nmass per unit area than for the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. For the calicos with the\nmedium and heaviest mass per unit area, the distance the blood spread laterally at impact, which\nincreased with the increase in impact velocity, had a greater inﬂuence on the dry bloodstain area than the\namount of wicking.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nAlthough bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has been used by\ncrime scene investigators for over a century [1], questions have\nbeen raised on the scientiﬁc validity of the work [2]. The premise\nof BPA is that the pattern that blood creates when impacting a\nsurface will enable the observer to gain an idea of the events\nwhich occurred to cause the bloodshed. However, the wide\nvariety of creation mechanisms, drop sizes, impact velocities and\ntarget surfaces indicate the complexity of BPA [3]. The reliability\nof pattern classiﬁcation of ﬁve bloodstain patterns on non-\nabsorbent rigid surfaces [4] and fabric surfaces [5] by expert BPA\nanalysts \nhas \nbeen \nconsidered. \nOn \nnon-absorbent \nsurfaces\nincorrect classiﬁcations were made 13.1% of the time [4] and\non fabric surfaces incorrect classiﬁcations were made 23.4% of the\ntime [5].\nAs such, more research is being undertaken on the understand-\ning of the interaction of blood with a variety of surfaces. Work has\nbeen carried out on non-absorbent surfaces (e.g. steel and plastic\n[6]) and partially absorbent surfaces (e.g. paper and wood [7–9]).\nEquations have resulted that use the bloodstain size and number of\nspines \nto back-calculate the impact velocity and \nassist \nin\ndetermination of the origin of the bloodstain [7–9].\nBloodstains on household and clothing fabrics often found at\ncrime scenes are also being researched. To understand bloodstains\non fabrics, it is important to consider wetting and wicking. Wetting\nand wicking are the mechanisms by which liquids move into and\nthrough a fabric [10]. Wetting occurs when the surface energy of a\nsolid overcomes the surface tension of a liquid, allowing the liquid\nto spread on the surface [10]. Once a fabric has been wetted,\nwicking can occur. Wicking is the spontaneous transport of a liquid\ninto a porous system by capillary forces. The rate at which the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: c.knock@cranﬁeld.ac.uk (C.

Determination of the directions and angles of impact and the centres of origin\nThe direction of impact and the vertical ﬂight path plane in the room can be\ndetermined by using the angle of impact and the directionality of the bloodstain. The\nangle of impact of the blood drop, which is formed between the direction of the blood\ndrop and the ﬂatsurfacethat is struck, is calculated basedon the relationship between\nthe length of the major and minor axes of the elliptical bloodstain. In addition, the\ndirectionality of the bloodstain is ascertained from the longitudinal axis of the ellipse\nand the direction in which the spin points (Fig. 5). In this manner, the directionality\nandlength of the major and minoraxes of the ellipseof all well-deﬁned bloodstains on\nwalls, ceilings and on furniture that has not been removed are accurately measured.\nBased on these measurements, the assumed straight line for the ﬂight path of the\nbloodstains is calculated and drawn in the 3D model of the crime scene using CAD\nsoftware. To reduce errors in determinating impact angles, only bloodstains with low\nimpact angles have been considered in the analysis [13–15].\nIn a top view of the impact directions of the bloodstains, convergence areas are\nshown in groups of straight lines in high concentration, which intersect one\nanother.\nThese\nconvergence\nareas\nare\npossible\ncentres\nof\norigin\nfor\nthe\ncorresponding bloodstains. In a side view, the height of the centres of origin is\ndetermined by ﬁnding the average intersections of only the straight lines of the\nbloodstains which occur at a short distance from the blood source location.\nThe photogrammetry software Elcovision 10 in combination with the AutoCAD\nsoftware performs an automatic calculation of all measured ellipses and draws the\ncalculated straight lines of the directions of impact of the bloodstains in the 3D\nmodel of the crime scene. Then the centres of origin are determined automatically\nby software, or manually, based on the produced 3D model.\n2.6. Ballistic determination of the trajectory of the blood spatter\nFor the determination of the blood source location, the trajectories of\nbloodstains, which are of a short distance from the blood drop origin, can be\nassumed as straight lines.\nIn cases of longer distance, a difference in the vertical component between the\nspatial direction of impact (in the vertical plane) and the expected centre of origin\narises, because of the curved trajectory of the drop. In these cases a ballistic\ndetermination of the trajectory of a blood drop is performed in order to show\nwhether these bloodstains arise from the determined centre of origin or from a\ndifferent origin.\n[(Fig._2)TD$FIG]\nFig. 2. 3D documentation of the crime scene.

Fig. 4 shows representative microscopic images of (a)\nspatter stain, (c) transfer stain from leather, and (e) transfer stain\nfrom glass, respectively. The corresponding magniﬁcations of the\nhighlighted areas are shown at right. Note that the two orienta-\ntions of loop legs are clearly visible. In the contact transfer patterns,\neach loop leg tends to be either completely saturated with blood\nor devoid of blood, a characteristic which is distinct from spatter.\nA qualitative observation, most apparent in Fig. 4e and f, is that the\nleft loop legs are stained more frequently than the right loop legs. In\nFig. 4f, for example, there are 9 stained left loop legs but only\n4 stained right loop legs, i.e., 69% of the stained loop legs occurred on\nleft loop legs. The same counting method using the 75% coverage\nminimum was used to analyze all 1200 high magniﬁcation images.\nEach image had on average approximately 50 stained loop legs;\napproximately 65,000 individual stained loop legs were counted.\n3.2. Count of ‘‘stained loop legs’’ by orientation\nTo see if the qualitative disparity in stained loop leg orientations\nshown in Fig. 4 was robust, we counted the number of stained left\nloop legs and right loop legs in each microscopic image. The\nresulting comparison of stained loop leg orientation between\nspatter patterns and contact transfer patterns is shown for both\nfabric types in Fig. 5. Each histogram shows the absolute count of\nmicroscopic images that contained a speciﬁed percentage of\nstained left loop legs. Note that each histogram is based on the\nanalysis of a total of 20 images \u0002 10 replicates = 200 microscopic\nimages for each experimental condition, i.e., each speciﬁed pattern\nand fabric type. Since in any given image there are equal numbers\nof left loop legs and right loop legs, one might expect that the odds\nof obtaining stained left loop legs versus stained right loop legs\nwould be even, i.e., each histogram would be Gaussian centered\naround 50%. Instead, however, we observe a pronounced tilt in the\nhistograms in favor of left loop legs over right. For the direct spatter\npatterns (Fig. 5a and d) the shift is minor: each distribution is\ncentered around 55%. In contrast, the contact transfer patterns\nexhibited signiﬁcant preferential staining of left loop legs: for\nleather (Fig. 5b and e) the distributions are centered around 60%\nand 65% respectively for pure cotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester.\nThe trend is even more stark for contact transfer on glass (Fig. 5c\nand f), with the distributions centered around 70% and 85% for pure\ncotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester. Notably, similar trends were\nobserved for both the 100% cotton and the 50% cotton/50%\npolyester fabrics. We note that there is an increasing trend of more\nimages with higher % stained left loop legs from spatter stain\npattern to transfer pattern and also from leather surface to glass\nsurface for transfer patterns.\nThese results, and corresponding tests for statistical signiﬁ-\ncance, are summarized in Fig. 6. Here the percent of stained left\nloop legs is averaged over the 10 replicate trials for each condition,\nrather than examined by individual image as in Fig. 5, to test for\ntrial reproducibility and statistical signiﬁcance. As shown in Fig. 6,\nthe spatter patterns for pure cotton and 50/50 cotton/polyester had\nrespectively 53.0 \u0003 1.9% and 53.7 \u0003 2.4% stained left loop legs. In\ncontrast, the pure cotton fabric had 56.2 \u0003 2.2% stained left loop legs\nwhen transferred from leather, and 64.1 \u0003 3.4% stained left loop legs\nwhen transferred from glass. Likewise, the 50/50 cotton/polyester\nhad 64.3 \u0003 5.8% when transferred from leather, and an extremely\nhigh 82.2 \u0003 4.5% when transferred from glass. Student’s t-test was\nused to determine whether each contact transfer pattern distribution\ndiffered signiﬁcantly from the corresponding spatter distribution; as\nindicated by the asterisks in Fig. 6, all of the contact transfer patterns\nwere statistically signiﬁcantly different compared to the spatter\npatterns. The most similar distribution, for pure cotton transferred\nfrom leather, had a p-value of 0.00218; the other p-values were\nnegligibly small (at 0.00018, 0.00000039 and 0.000000000067). In\nother words, the differences between the spatter and contact transfer\nwere statistically robust in all four examined conditions.\n3.3. Analysis of fabric topography\nAccording to the orientation count results, several general-\nizations can be made: (1) left loop legs are signiﬁcantly more likely\nFig. 3.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset.

As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface.

This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform.

Droplets were produced from a series of conical nozzles,\nmanufactured with a range of cone angles and including a set of un-bored conical tips, under conditions\nwhere the tip was either non-wetted or pre-wetted with blood. For the former, radius-limited case,\ndetached droplet volumes were found to agree well with the predictions of both the pendent drop weight\nand drop shape models. For pre-wetted tips, droplet volumes were found to increase with increasing\ncone angle and to be independent of whether the blood ﬂow was through an oriﬁce at the tip or across the\ntip surface itself for un-bored tips. Such angle-limited, detached droplet volumes were predicted well by\napplying the same contact angle correction factor as for a ﬂat surface. The maximum droplet volume,\nformed from a horizontal ﬂat surface, was found to be around 150 mL for horse blood. Similar theoretical\napproaches were then extended to droplets released under centrifugal force appropriate to swing cast-off\nactivity and evaluated using previously published experimental data. Order of magnitude agreement for\ndroplet diameters was fairly good but, more importantly, these were found to be proportional to the\ninverse of the tangential velocity thereby supporting a model where the blood droplet is released directly\nfrom a blood mass itself, such as a ligament, rather than from being pinned to some surface feature or\noriﬁce on the weapon. This work provides a sound theoretical and experimental understanding of blood\ndroplet release under these conditions that can underpin both future research and the interpretation of\nblood evidence in case-work.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nOver recent years there have been many published studies\nexploring the science underpinning bloodstain pattern analysis.\nAmongst this literature, many of these [1–9] have focused on the\ndynamics of blood droplets, surface impact and stain formation,\nincluding impact angle and surface texture effects, whilst others\nhave investigated \npattern \nformation \nitself, \nfor \nexample \nby\nanalysing droplet trajectories and the methodologies used in\ncase-work examination and interpretation [10–15]. In contrast,\nthere are fewer examples where the initial formation of the blood\ndroplets themselves has been studied, for example on weapon tips,\nand speciﬁcally the factors which govern the volume of the droplet\nreleased whether under passive (drip from a static source) or active\n(for example, from swing cast-off) conditions [16–18]. Studies of\nthese factors, for the most part, have focused on experimental\ninvestigations rather than exploration of the theoretical basis for\ndroplet formation and the veriﬁcation of such mathematical\nmodels against those experimental data.\nThis present work was designed to ﬁll this gap in the literature\nby reviewing and developing current understanding of the\nmechanisms underpinning the formation and adhesion of blood\ndroplets at oriﬁces and on surfaces – the pendent drop – and the\nconditions under which droplets are released, either under gravity\nalone or under the centrifugal force generated during swing cast-\noff. To test and evaluate such a quantitative, theoretical approach, a\nseries of experiments was carried out to obtain data on the\nrelationship between the size, shape and properties of the oriﬁce\nor surface and the volume of blood droplets formed on passive\nrelease. This was achieved by using bored and un-bored conical\nbrass tips machined at a variety of angles as models for weapon tips\nof differing sharpness. In this study particular attention was paid to\nthe degree of wetting of the surface by the blood and the\nconsequent size of the detached droplet. In addition, quantitative\ndata already published, from model swing cast-off studies [12,16],\nhas been used in a similar fashion to evaluate mathematical\nmodels for the active release of blood droplets.\nE-mail address: c.d.adam@keele.ac.uk (C.D.

Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis has several applications in crime\nscene reconstruction, informing on the sequence and timing of the\nevents, their mode of operation, and the location of blood sources.\nThe latter application is known as the determination of the region of\norigin and involves the inspection of bloodstains and the backward\nreconstruction of trajectories. Current methodologies for predicting\nthe origin of a bloodletting event rely on assuming that blood drops\ntravel in straight lines [1]. While simple, the technique involves\nintrinsic inaccuracies since the effect of drag and gravity on drop\nﬂight are unaccounted. These inaccuracies become signiﬁcant as the\ndistance between the origin of the event and the spatter increases, or\nin speciﬁc cases of downward projecting drops [2]. Several extensive\nstudies have also explored the uncertainty associated with an\narbitrary selection of stains or the values of impact angles [3–5].\nTo reconstruct the trajectories backward and account for drag\nand gravity, knowledge of droplet size and impact velocity is\nrequired [6]. These can be estimated from the morphology of the\nbloodstains, by e.g. analyzing their size, volume and number of\nspines [7–9]. In this regard, there is signiﬁcant literature proposing\ncorrelations between stain diameters, droplet sizes, and impact\nvelocities [7,10,11]. A few studies have also demonstrated backward\nreconstruction of trajectories [7,11], albeit without quantifying the\ninﬂuence of speciﬁc target properties and blood hematocrit. Blood is\nindeed a highly complex, shear-thinning, non-Newtonian ﬂuid,\nwhose ﬂow behavior depends on several factors such as: shear rate\n(or the impact velocity), temperature, hematocrit and humidity\n[12–14]. Hematocrit values in human blood of healthy individuals\nvary between values of about 40 to 45% [1,15,16].\nThis manuscript highlights the effect of varying target conditions\nin predicting the trajectories of blood drops. The experimental\nanalysis\npresented\nhere\nconsiders\ndripping\ndrops\nimpacting\nvertically on glass, cardboard, polycarbonate and aluminum targets.\nThe inﬂuence of target wettability and roughness is documented,\ntogether with the inﬂuence of humidity, room temperature, blood\ntemperature and hematocrit. The study also describes a process to\nmeasure the viscosity of blood and to estimate its variation with\nhematocrit and temperature. The spreading characteristics of the\ndrop, in regards to surface wettability and roughness, are discussed\nby generating individual correlations for each of the targets. Based\non the differences between correlations, the study quantiﬁes the\ninaccuracies\nin\nthe\nsimple\ntrajectory\nreconstruction\ntask\nof\nidentifying the drop release height when target-independent\ncorrelations or population-average hematocrit levels are used\ninstead of values speciﬁc to the case at hand.\nForensic Science International 266 (2016) 178–184\nA R T I C L E\nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 3 February 2016\nReceived in revised form 4 May 2016\nAccepted 17 May 2016\nAvailable online 24 May 2016\nKeywords:\nBloodstain pattern analysis\nDrop impact\nTrajectories\nHematocrit\nSurface roughness\nWettability\nA B S T R A C T\nTrajectory reconstruction from inspection of bloodstain patterns is relevant to crime scene investigation.\nWhile the inﬂuence of target properties on trajectory reconstruction has been often qualitatively\ndiscussed, it has rarely been quantiﬁed. Similarly, a few impact studies measure the viscosity of the blood\nused in impact experiments. In this work, the impact of blood drops is investigated on targets with a range\nof surface roughness and surface material. The maximum spreading is characterized using a spreading\ncorrelation, which relates the ratio of stain diameter to drop diameter with the non-dimensional numbers\nReynolds number and Ohnesorge number. The process for obtaining individual spreading correlations for\neach of the target substrates and for measuring the viscosity of the respective blood samples is described\nextensively. The error in estimating the drop release height, associated with using an impact correlation\nunspeciﬁc to the target of interest, is estimated analytically and numerically using experimental data. A\nsimilar analysis is done when the hematocrit of the blood is assumed rather than measured.

One\nreconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes\nan automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes.\nClassification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data\nsets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and\nperform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting\nthe stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at dis-\ntances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter pat-\nterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, classification, impact spatters, gunshot spatters, spatter pattern, machine learning,\nimage analysis, random forests, feature engineering\nSee Comment here\nSee Authors’ Response here\nA bloodstain pattern is an ensemble of bloodstains. Stains are\nmarks that can be observed on a solid surface called a target. A\nblood spatter pattern is produced by drops from a blood source\nwhich have traveled through the air before reaching a target surface,\nsuch as a wall or the cardstock used in this study. Bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) has been used in US criminal courts since the sec-\nond half of last century (1–3). BPA interprets the bloodstain patterns\nin a crime scene in order to provide evidence to support the crime\nscene reconstruction (3,4). Typically, BPA uses principles of phy-\nsics, statistics, biology, and mathematics. Example reconstruction\nquestions are as follows: “What is the mechanism causing the\nbloodstain patterns? Where is the origin of the blood source?”\nRegarding the latter question, established methods based on\nthe assumption of straight trajectories are widely used to predict\nthe region of origin of a blood spatter pattern (5,6). Reference\n(7) proposed a method to improve the determination of the blood\nsource location, and Varney et al. (8) introduced a plot-based\nmethod to locate the blood source. Further, Camana et al. (9)\nused a probabilistic approach to identify the horizontal projection\nof the location of the blood source.\nWhile there have been multiple academic efforts to estimate the\nlocation of the blood source, less attention has been given to deter-\nmine the mechanism causing the spatter pattern. A question of\ninterest is whether the spatter patterns were caused by a bullet or\nblunt impact. Classifying the bloodstain patterns helps support\nother evidences such as weapons or bullet marks found on the\ncrime scene. Stain size is used in Ref. (3) to classify spatter pat-\nterns between high-velocity spatter patterns, usually generated\nfrom gunshot, and medium-velocity blood spatter patterns, that is,\ngenerated from blunt impacts of club, axe, hammer, fist, and brick.\nThey observed in their experiment that “many” stains in a med-\nium-velocity spatter pattern exhibit 1/8 inch diameter or smaller,\nwhile “essentially all” stains in a high-velocity spatter pattern have\ndiameters smaller than 1/8 inch. James et al. (10) presents the tra-\nditional method of distinguishing medium- and high-velocity\nimpact spatter patterns based on a hypothetical correlation between\nthe velocity of the generation mechanism and the size of resulting\nbloodstains. They stated that “medium-velocity impact spatters\n(MVIS) are bloodstains created when the source of blood is sub-\njected to a force with a velocity in the range of 5 to 25 ft/sec. The\ndiameters of the resulting stains are in the size range of 1 to 3 mm,\nalthough smaller and larger stains may be present. Stains in this\ncategory were usually associated with beatings and stabbings.” On\nthe other hand, “High velocity impact spatters (HVIS) are blood-\nstains created when the source of blood is subjected to a force with\nvelocity of greater than 100 ft/sec. The diameters of the spatters\nare predominately less than 1 mm, although smaller and larger\nstains are often observed....”\nThere is currently no widely accepted method to discriminate\nbetween\ngunshot\nand\nimpact\npatterns,\nand\nthe\nforensic\n1Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Atanasoff Hall,\n2434 Osborn Dr, Ames, 50011, IA.\n2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, 2025\nBlack Engineering, Ames, 50011, IA.\n3Department of Statistics, Iowa State University, 2438 Osborn Dr, Ames,\n50011, IA.\nCorresponding author: Yu Liu, Ph.D. E-mail: liuyu0jlu@gmail.com\n[Correction added 16 January 2020.

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Study 4: use of a simpliﬁed physical nose model\nThe above physiological studies, whilst containing the essential\nbiological relevance, were not entirely controllable or reproduc-\nible. Therefore, it was decided to devise an idealised physical nose\nmodel and experiment which, though it might potentially be\ncriticised for its extreme simplicity and remoteness from the real\nbiological situation, could be more clearly deﬁned and controlled.\nThe model (Fig. 1a) consisted of a short, 4.5 or 6.0 mm diameter\nplastic tube representing the nasal valve and more external parts of\nthe nose, connected to a large volume syringe representing the\nlung via a simpliﬁed representation of the nasal cavity (consisting\nof a ﬂat chamber of two parallel diamond-shaped Perspex plates)\nand tubing representing the major airways (Fig. 1b).\nThree drops of fresh human venous blood (total volume approx.\n0.045 ml) were instilled into the nasal valve, or nasal cavity, at one\nof the three positions shown (Fig. 1b). A controlled, small volume of\nair was then rapidly expelled through the system by dropping a\nweight onto the syringe plunger, depressing it in approx. 0.1 s and\ngenerating a peak transient pressure within the syringe of less than\napprox. 15 mm Hg. This exhalation of air always caused an aerosol\nof blood to be expelled through the nasal tube. Air volumes as small\nas 62.5 ml were exhaled from the model. This was not the lower\nlimit of volume capable of aerosolising blood, simply it was the\nsmallest volume tested; even this small volume produced copious\nspots on the targets. The resulting blood droplets were captured on\npaper surfaces placed horizontally 20 cm beneath the model and\nvertically at a distance of 50 cm (Fig. 1a).

Also quench-\ning (intermolecular electronic energy transfer) or inner-ﬁlter\neffects (molecule absorbing at the emission wave-length of the\nemitter) from other molecular constituents of the bloodstains\n(heme itself, O2, several aminoacids, etc.) or, more likely, of the\nsubstrate possessing the evidence should be regarded as pos-\nsible interferents due to their ability to decrease the observed\nchemiluminescent/ﬂuorescent intensity [85].\nHowever, in practice, most of these substances are unlikely\nto come into contact with blood, with some relevant exceptions\nsuch as polyphenolic derivatives [69,86,87] like tannins which\nare widely present in wood. Thus these species do not generally\nsigniﬁcantly impact on the forensic use of luminol, and false-\nnegativeresultshavenotbeendescribedintheforensicliterature.\nThe most problematic chemicals for a correct interpretation\nof luminol test results are those which provoke intensiﬁcation or\na generation of a chemiluminescence emission even if blood is\nnot present, leading to false-positive results. Due to the possible\npresence of these substances at the crime scene, the luminol\ntest must not be considered sufﬁciently speciﬁc to permit an\nunequivocal identiﬁcation of blood [15,18,51,88,89].\nThose compounds which generate luminol chemilumines-\ncence, or enhance the luminol emission in the presence of\nbloodstains can be divide into three major categories (Fig. 13):\n1. compounds\nshowing\na\ncatalytic\ntrue\nperoxidase\nor\nperoxidase-like activity;\n2. compounds with a high oxidizing capacity towards luminol;\n3. compounds with a complex chemical composition with an\nundeﬁned action mechanism towards luminol mixture.\nThe ﬁrst group encompasses inorganic or bioinorganic\nspecies and undoubtedly is the major source of luminol inter-\nferences as these compounds often show excellent catalysing\nproperties in redox reactions such as that involving luminol\noxidation and are widely distributed in the environment and\nin plants. In general three main types may be characterized in\nthis group: free metal ions, in most cases included in inorganic\ncompounds such as rust or soils; biological complexes between\nmetal ions and organic components (such as metal–porphyrins,\nand including bacterial or plant pigments) often within protein\nstructures; enzymes belonging to the oxidoreductases class such\nas horseradish-peroxidases.\nIron compounds, especially in the form of Fe2+ and Fe3+,\nare constituents of many inorganic and biological species abun-\ndantly distributed in the environment [90–92]. In soils and\nsediments, iron is the dominant redox-active element by virtue of\nits abundance and favourable reduction potential located mid-\nway in the aqueous regime. Iron is the fourth most abundant\nelement on the earth’s crust and is present in several minerals\nsuch as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe2O3), siderite (FeCO3)\nor pyrite (FeS2) which may serve as large reservoirs of electron-\nbuffering capacity in soils and whose surfaces catalyze reactions\nthat may proceed only slowly, if at all, in bulk solution [93].\nInaqueousaerobicenvironmentsandatneutralpHironcanbe\nfound in highly insoluble crystalline and amorphous hydroxide\nandoxideforms[94]includingsuchsubstancesasrust(amixture\nof iron oxides and hydroxides with a variable hydration degree\nand structural formula [Fe2O3·nH2O]), and these compounds\ncan also act as catalysts for the luminol reaction [95,96]. Also\nmany metal objects and baked clays contain iron.\nSimilarly several other metallic ions such as cobalt,\nchromium, nickel, copper, and manganese, which are also found\nin soils or metal objects and some chemical products, have been\nreported, in various experimental studies, as capable of produc-\ning visible chemiluminescence when exposed to the luminol\nsolution [42,83,97–99].\nFerric or ferrous ions and other metals ions especially\ncobalt, copper, and manganese, are present in some biological\nmolecules including redox active prosthetic groups. Examples\ninclude the heme proteins peroxidases, catalase, cytochromes,\nand non-heme biomolecules such as the iron–sulfur cluster\nenzyme aconitase and the electron transfer proteins rubredox-\nins and ferredoxins [100,101]. Storage and transfer proteins\nlike ferritin or hemosiderin, the main storage forms of iron\nin mammals, as well as transferrin, the iron transferring pro-\ntein into the blood, contain signiﬁcant concentrations of ferric\nions.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Recognition accuracy\nThe numerical curves of training accuracy and test accuracy for this \nstudy, under the specified parameters, are presented in Fig. 8. The \nvertical axis represents the model’s accuracy, while the horizontal axis \nindicates the number of iterations for the training and test sets. The \nobserved change in accuracy indicates that the accuracy of both the \ntraining set and the test set increases as the loss decreases. The final \naccuracy of the training set at convergence is approximately 95 %, while \nthe accuracy of the test set ranges between 0.91 and 0.93.\n4. Discussion\nBloodstains serve as crucial physical evidence, often providing sig­\nnificant breakthroughs in challenging cases. They not only verify case \nfacts but also play a pivotal role in reconstructing the crime scene and \nrevealing the truth behind criminal activities. To assist crime scene in­\nvestigators in distinguishing impact spatter from fly spots accurately and \nwithout damaging samples, this study employs a transfer learning model \nbased on ResNet-18 to differentiate the two types of bloodstains. The \nexperimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an overall \naccuracy rate of 93 %. These findings indicate that the application of \nresidual neural network-based image recognition techniques in BPA is \nboth feasible and highly accurate. This study holds significant scientific \nvalue and offers promising applications in BPA. Compared to traditional \nmethods, the AI-based approach minimizes human error and mitigates \nthe risk of misjudgment due to variations in expert experience, thereby \nenhancing the objectivity and reliability of the results. Furthermore, this \ntechnology preserves the integrity of the crime scene by automating the \nanalysis of bloodstain images, eliminating the need for direct contact \nwith the evidence. This innovation not only provides an intelligent so­\nlution for BPA but also transforms the conventional, experience-based \nmodel into a data-driven approach. Moreover, this technology has \nsubstantial practical implications for courtroom forensics. Traditional \nBPA methods often face challenges in terms of accuracy and scientific \nvalidity, particularly when expert testimony conflicts with analytical \nresults, which can lead to uncertainty in legal decisions. In contrast, AI \ntechnology yields consistent, reproducible analysis results, thereby \nenhancing the scientific credibility of bloodstain evidence and \nincreasing its acceptance in court, ultimately contributing to the pursuit \nof justice.\nIn this study, real human and mammalian blood was not selected for \nthe experiment, primarily due to the bloodstain simulation experiment \nwas scheduled in October-November 2022 in the period of COVID-19 \ncontrol. During this time, China’s regulations on livestock and animal \nproducts were further strengthened. According to regional laws and \nregulations, it was challenging for individuals to obtain fresh blood from \nfood animal slaughterhouses, such as those for pigs, cows, and sheep. \nConsidering that the primary objective of this study was to classify and \nidentify the morphology of impact spatters and fly spots using the \nResNet-18 model, Zhou et al. [19] found in their experiment, which \nutilized a convolutional neural network to analyze morphological im­\nages of droplet bloodstains, that the morphological characteristics of \nbloodstains could be accurately simulated using red ink instead of blood \nafter conducting several tests. Singh et al. [28] also used fake blood \nmade from Awlata dye in drop experiments and observed bloodstain \npattern at various heights, confirming the relationship between drop \nheight and the formation of satellite stains and spines. In their study, \nthey suggested that researchers and scientists could use fake blood made \nfrom Awlata dye for experimental purposes in future studies. Mean­\nwhile, Byrd et al. [29] and Wang et al. [30] confirmed that adult flies can \nsurvive on sucrose and milk, making it feasible to use sucrose-enriched \nartificial blood combined with milk to feed flies during the fly spots \nsimulation experiment. Due to the presence of pigments and honey in \nthe fake theatrical blood provided to the flies, they may be unable to \ndigest or regurgitate the fake blood as effectively as they do real blood. \nHowever, our observations confirmed that adult flies could regurgitate \nand excrete simultaneously while feeding. In summary, the results of \nthis simulation experiment, using fake theatrical blood instead of real \nblood, should be sufficient for analysis. Additionally, this study opted to \nstrike blood pools with a blunt object, a scenario more commonly seen in \nhomicide cases, while simulating impact spatters at various distances. \nThis approach more accurately reproduced the distribution and \nmorphological characteristics of the impact spatters.\nIt is important to note that all bloodstain patterns in this study were \nformed under controlled laboratory conditions, and only impact spatters \nand fly spots were modeled. These two types of bloodstains were not \npresent in the same space and did not interact with each other. However, \nin actual crime scenes involving intentional injuries or homicides, the \ncircumstances can be more complex. Not only is the amount of blood \ngreater, but the variety of bloodstain patterns is also more diverse. The \nidentification process becomes significantly more challenging when \ndifferent bloodstains mix or overlap. As the model developed in this \nFig. 7.

    "text_chunk": "Robust estimation for area of origin in bloodstain pattern analysis via directional\nanalysis\nM. Illes *, M. Boue´\nTrent University, Department of Forensic Science, Canada\n1. Introduction\nThe estimation of a blood source origin is one of the most\nessential pieces of evidence that can be extracted from a\nbloodletting crime scene. When a force is applied to a blood\nsource, single bloodstains will ﬂy through the air until striking a\ntarget surface. A bloodstain pattern area of origin is the three\ndimensional location of that blood source. Estimating the location\nby directional analysis consists of retracing the trajectories of a\ngroup of selected (upward directional) bloodstains that originated\nfrom this area. The trajectories are determined through trigono-\nmetric identities that relate the width and length of a stain (more\nprecisely, of an ellipse that is carefully ﬁtted to the stain) to the\nimpact angle of the droplet and to the glancing angle of the\nbloodstain (the angle measured on the wall between the main axis\nof the stain and the vertical) [1]. Once the trajectories emanating\nfrom each stain have been retraced, obtaining the estimate of the\norigin is a simple procedure. The x and y coordinates of the\nestimate correspond to the arithmetic mean1 of the x and y\ncoordinates, respectively, of all the points on the x–y plane (the\ntop-view) where the retraced trajectories intersect (see Fig. 1).\nWhen viewed from the side (on the x–z plane), and ﬁxing the x\ncoordinate of the origin, an upper limit for the z coordinate is\nobtained as the mean of the z values of the trajectories at that ﬁxed\nlevel of x (see Fig. 2).\nThe method of directional analysis as described above has been\nwell documented and validated in the literature (see [1–5] and the\nreferences therein). Nevertheless, considering the sensitivity of the\nmean to the presence of outliers, it is natural to ask whether the\nmethod can be made more robust by modifying the averaging\nprocedure. In this paper we focus our attention on two robust\nalternatives: the trimmed mean and a deterministic version of the\nRANSAC algorithm. We analyze and compare the performance of\nthese statistics under two different settings. In the ﬁrst setting\n(Case A), we consider impact patterns where all upward moving\nstains have been measured, and we take random samples of size 20\nfrom all of the stains. In this situation the variance of the\nestimation is greatly reduced for all patterns when using the\ntrimmed mean, with a small improvement in accuracy. Moreover,\nwhen stains were excluded from the samples according to the\ncriteria for stain selection identiﬁed in [2], the reduction in\nvariance was less pronounced in most cases, supporting the\nconclusion that those criteria can indeed help identify stains which\naffect the accuracy of the estimation negatively. We also study the\nmore realistic setting (Case B) where only a small set of stains has\nbeen deliberately selected and measured by a bloodstain analyst\nForensic Science International 226 (2013) 223–229\nA R T I C L E \nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 8 May 2012\nReceived in revised form 15 January 2013\nAccepted 25 January 2013\nAvailable online 19 February 2013\nKeywords:\nBloodstain pattern analysis\nImpact pattern\nForensic science\nStatistics\nDirectional analysis\nArea of origin\nA B S T R A C T\nDirectional analysis provides quantitative data supporting the three-dimensional estimation of the area of\norigin for impact bloodstain pattern analysis. The ﬁnal stage of directional analysis consists of calculating\nthe point of origin via the arithmetic mean of top-view intersecting points and side-view heights of the\nvirtual trajectories of single stains within the impact pattern. Given the sensitivity of the mean to the\npresence of outliers (droplets that have been inﬂuenced by gravitational force and aerodynamic drag), it is\nnatural to ask whether directional analysis can be made more robust by modifying the averaging\nprocedure. In this paper we focus our attention on two robust alternatives to the arithmetic mean: the\ntrimmed mean and a deterministic version of the RANSAC algorithm. Our results suggest that the trimmed\nmean is a practical robust alternative to the arithmetic mean, whereas the deterministic RANSAC procedure\nis not. Since there can be no guarantee that stain selection can be free of outliers, the trimmed mean can be\nused as an aide in their detection. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the trimmed mean can also be used to\ndetect outliers among the points of intersection of trajectories. Outliers of this type occur as the intersection\npoints of trajectories emanating from stains with nearly vertical paths.\n\u0002 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Impact and gamma angles\nThe angle of impact (θ), a crucial factor in bloodstain pattern anal­\nysis, refers to the angle at which blood drops strike a surface. The \nappearance of the bloodstain varies with changes in the impact angle. \nPerpendicular impacts produce circular shapes, while at more oblique \nangles the ellipse appears more elongated [12]. \nθ = sin−1\n(width\nlength\n)\n#\n(1) \nIn Eq. (1), “width” refers to the minor axis of the ellipse, while \n“length” denotes the major axis. In bloodstain analysis, gamma angle, \nknown as directional angle, is an important indicator to identify the \ndirection of movement of the blood drop with relative to a reference axis \n(typically a horizontal or a vertical plane) [13]. It is calculated by \nconsidering the orientation and direction of movement of the stain. For \nexample, if a stain is tilted at 45 degrees and the droplet moved to the \nright, the gamma angle is 45 degrees. If the same stain resulted from a \ndroplet moving to the left, the gamma angle would be 225 degrees (180 \ndegrees in the opposite direction). By looking at both the gamma angle \nand the impact angle, analysts can estimate where the blood drops came \nfrom before it hit the surface, helping to find the source of the bloodstain \n[12]. However, this estimation does not consider other forces like \ngravity and air resistance.\n2.4. Method for area of origin calculation\nThere are various methods in the literature such as tangent method, \nstringing, automated tangent method, least squares angles for analyzing \nthe ellipse models formed and determining the area of origin. The \ntangent method and string stretching are mostly manual methods [3, \n14]. In order to understand the tangent method, it is necessary to \nunderstand how to determine the AO. As a result of examining each of \nthe bloodstains formed because of the Impact Mechanism, the impact \nangle is obtained.\nIn the first stage of the tangent method, the intersection points of the \nlines drawn and extended from the major axes of the ellipses are \nanalyzed in a pairwise manner. Then, the intersection region is deter­\nmined, and the Y and Z coordinates of the AO are determined. The \nsecond stage is to find the X coordinate by applying the tangent rule. In \nthis stage, first, the distance Di, which is the projection of each ellipse to \nthe intersection region, is determined as shown in Fig. 4. Then, the \nlength and width of the ellipse are used to determine the impact angle \n(θi) [14]. \nAOy = 1\nn\n∑n\ni=1(Di⋅tan(θi) )#\n(2) \nAs shown in Eq. (2), multiplying the distance to the intersection Di by \nthe tangent of the calculated impact angles gives us the total distance \nperpendicular to the target surface. Since the calculated value contains \ninformation from all ellipses, we then divide the found value by the total \nnumber of ellipses (n) to come up with the X coordinate of the Area of \nOrigin (AOx) [14].\nNote that, Area of Origin in this case refers to a point since the Area of \nOrigin is defined as \"The space in three dimensions to which the trajectories \nof spatter can be utilized to determine the location of the spatter producing \nevent \" [13]. For the scope of this study, coordinates AOy and AOz are not \ncalculated intentionally due to the experimental setup. Since, the \nexperiment is set up in a way that the source is placed globally (AOx, 0, \n0). That means, the source is placed perpendicular to the origin point of \nthe cardstock. Thus, finding the remaining two coordinates other than \nAOx is an unnecessary effort.\nAs a result of each analysis, the estimated source distance is calcu­\nlated with supporting 2D graphics where detected ellipses and impact \nangles are shown (Figs. 5), and 3D graphics where the AOx is shown \n(Fig. 6). For convenience, details of a single case study in which the \nsource to target distance is 35 cm and shooting distance is 0 cm is \npresented.\nIn forensic practice, analysts determine whether the observed \nbloodstains are more circular (eccentricity close to 0) or more elongated \n(eccentricity close to 1) before inputting a suitable minimum and \nmaximum eccentricity range. Once these values are provided, the al­\ngorithm further optimizes the selection by prioritizing the most \nfrequently occurring eccentricity values within the image, ensuring that \nFig. 3.

In fact, the commercial products\nshare similar spreading characteristics to water. This is primarily\ndue to the products’ low viscosity. When applying the range of\nexperimental conditions (10 to 75 mL droplet volumes and impact\nvelocities 1.4 to 6.0 ms\u00041) to the reported whole human blood\nrange, a theoretical range of spread is determined. This range,\nshown in Fig. 4, was determined using an accommodating\napproach, one that exploits the entire range of physical property\nvalues reported in the literature. Again, some stains made by\nwater and the commercial standards fall outside of this range,\nwhile the sol–gel solutions, particularly the LAGT and FBS, do not.\nThis is best demonstrated by Fig. 5, which uses the ﬂuids’\nOhnesorge numbers in relation to droplet spread. The vertical\nspread in data at a speciﬁc Ohnesorge number is dictated by the\ndroplet’s impact velocity. Again, this plot demonstrates how the\nLAGT and FBS solutions spread in a manner similar to whole\nhuman blood range. Caution is recommended when using and\napplying the commercial ﬂuids in dripping experiments under\nthe tested conditions.\nThe obvious extension of this work is to investigate splashing;\nparticularly in spine and scallop formation as well as the\ngeneration of satellite stains from the parent stain.\n3.4. Importance for validation prior to implementation in training\nEstablishing validation protocols are important for implement-\ning an artiﬁcial ﬂuid into bloodstain training and research\nprograms [29]. Using ﬂuids that can accurately represent the\nmechanisms of bloodshed is important for training, particularly\nwhere whole blood is not used. This holds true for both\nquantitative and qualitative stain and pattern characteristics. It\nis important to consider how well a ﬂuid mimics a well-researched\nbloodstain pattern type. This is because there is little user-beneﬁt\nin using a material with physical properties that are signiﬁcantly\ndifferent than whole blood as it could potentially provide a false\nvisualization of bloodstain pattern formation. This is particularly\nimportant in training, as providing an accurate representation of a\nscientiﬁc concept is important for a learner to understand the\ntheoretical and experimental core principles of pattern formation\n[30]. This is why investigating the fundamental dynamics of\ncandidate FBS materials during pattern simulation is so important\nfor implementation into the industry.\n4. Conclusion\nThis work extends the validation of the silicon sol–gel material\nas a candidate FBS for simulated passive dripping under controlled\nconditions on a paper substrate. Passive drip stains of six different\nﬂuids were created and their spread analyzed. Spread was modeled\nusing the Scheller and Bousﬁeld correlation, with an applied\neffective high-shear viscosity for non-Newtonian ﬂuids. A theo-\nretical range for whole human blood was determined and applied\nto the data. This was used to show that droplet spread from the\nLAGT and FBS solutions were more similar to blood, and the two\ncommercial products more similar to water. This work emphasizes\nthe need to characterize and thoroughly test FBS materials for use\nin crime scene research and training.\nConﬂict of interest\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest from the work of this\npaper.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Dr. Suresh Narine of the Trent University\nCenter for Biomaterials Research for access to equipment as well as\nDr. Laziz Bouzidi and Peter Andreas for their technical advice with\nthe rheometer.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

    "text_chunk": "5. Results and discussion\nIn this section, reconstruction results are described. The\nreconstructed patterns involve actual cast-off experiments, and\nsimulated cast-off patterns. The actual cast-off experiments\ninclude swings executed along circular and non-circular swings\nby human participants, and circular swings executed by the\nrotating arm of a Castanova device, already presented in [16].\nReconstruction results are presented in terms of uncertainty\nregions, which are spatial regions most likely to contain some of\nthe path of the weapon that generated the cast-off. The uncertainty\nregions are estimated based on the geometric and probabilistic\nmethods expressed above. Three embedded uncertainty regions\nare typically shown, each corresponding to a speciﬁc likelihood\nvalue. The likelihood value mathematically corresponds to the\nmeasure of goodness of a statistical ﬁt and can assume values\nbetween zero and one. Practically, likelihood values of 60%, 75%\nand 90% are used in this work. Low likelihood values correspond to\nlarger uncertainty volumes and higher chances of intersecting the\nweapon swing. High likelihood values correspond to smaller\nuncertainty volumes and lower chances of intersecting the weapon\nswing.\nFor example, Fig. 6 displays reconstruction results for a\n“Castanova” spatter pattern, where the motion of the blood-\ncovered rod is circular. Several orthonormal views are presented of\nthe uncertainty regions and measured weapon swing. Orthonor-\nmal views conﬁrm that the reconstructed swing intersects with the\nmeasured swing, and measure the uncertainty of the reconstructed\nswing (which is represented by embedded regions of different\nlikelihood). For instance, the green volume in Fig. 6, U75%, is the\nuncertainty on the reconstructed cast-off swing assuming a\nlikelihood value of 75%. A spatial resolution of 5 cm is used for\nall the numerical results presented in this work, unless speciﬁed\notherwise.\nThe results of one of the “sitting” cast-off pattern, with\nexperimental details described above, are presented in Fig. 7.\nThe measured swing of the ink-covered rod intersects the\nreconstructed swing. Fig. 7 also illustrates the effect of the spatial\nreconstruction on the quality of the results. Results with a\nresolution of 25 cm appear rough, while there is no obvious\ndifference in results with 10 cm or 5 cm resolution.\nFig. 8 displays the reconstruction results for non-circular\n“human” cast-off spatter (trial 7). Cast-off reconstruction results\nare superimposed with the corresponding captured cast-off\nmotion depicted by a black line and uncertainty region in yellow,\nand video frames of the human subject producing the cast-off. The\nmeasured weapon swing was clockwise and clearly intersects the\nreconstructed regions.\nFor all the numerical results above, likelihood values have been\nspeciﬁcally selected to minimize both uncertainty and error in the\nreconstruction. While the volume of the reconstructed swings is\nthe uncertainty on the reconstruction of the weapon motion\n(which is a one-dimensional curved line, with zero volume), the\nerror in the reconstructed cast-off region can be measured as the\nclosest distance between the estimated reconstructed cast-off\nregion and the recorded cast-off motion. We assume that the latter,\nwithin its own measurement uncertainty, is the most accurate\nmeasurement of the swing. Fig. 9 illustrates how the uncertainty\nand error vary with the selected likelihood value, showing average\nvalues and standard deviations for the reconstruction of six\n“human” cast-off spatter patterns, similar to and including that of\nFig. 8. The average volume of each uncertainty region is provided in\nFig. 9, as a function of the likelihood value. The volume of the\nuncertainty region corresponding to likelihood L ¼ 90%, noted\nU90%, is smaller than 20 L (the volume of a small daypack) for every\none of the trials studied. Among all trials, the average uncertainty\nvolumes U75% and U60% is respectively 104 L and 296 L, respectively.\nThe lower the likelihood value, the larger the volume of the\nuncertainty region, until it becomes comparable to the volume of\nthe entire room volume (58,430 L). As reported in Fig. 9, the\naverage error associated with region U90% is 6 cm, and the error is\nless than 17 cm for all the trials studied. The average error\nassociated with U75% for all trials is less than 2 cm. No error is found\nfor U60%, which means that this uncertainty region embed at least a\nportion of the known cast-off motion for every trial considered.\nThe choice of likelihood value therefore controls the trade-off\nbetween uncertainty and error. The lower the likelihood value, the\nlower the error, but the larger the uncertainty. The sweet spot of\nFig. 6.

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

To\nadequately discern between these models, we rely on differing\npredictions for the role of the underlying substrate. In particular,\nthe direct-contact model would be expected to depend on the\nsubstrate thermal properties, and a more detailed analysis of this\ndependence is developed in the next section.\nPredicting the Amount of Exchanged Heat. The mechanism of\nﬁnite-time heat exchange between a drop and a superhydropho-\nbic substrate in the absence of a gas layer and coating can be\nmodeled analytically. Here, we approximate the energy evolution\nas one dimensional and consider conduction as the main mech-\nanism of heat transfer (Heat Transfer Mechanism). If we model\nthe heat ﬂux ˙q(t) and contact radius r(t) as decoupled, then the\ntotal heat transferred by a single drop over a residence time tr\ncan be estimated as Q =\nR tr\n0 ˙q(t)πr(t)2dt. The contact radius ini-\ntially spreads to a maximum radius before retracting back to zero.\nThese spreading and retraction dynamics can be approximated\n(1) using the relation r(t) = 2rm\nq\nt/tr −(t/tr)2.\nTo calculate the heat ﬂux ˙q(t), we model the drop and sub-\nstrate as two semiinﬁnite bodies at different initial temperatures,\nTℓfor the liquid and Ts for the substrate, that are brought into\ncontact and achieve temperature equality at the contact surface,\nT(z = 0, t) (Fig. 4A). For conduction-dominated heat transfer,\nthis semiinﬁnite approximation is appropriate when the thermal\ndiffusion length √αtr is less than the thickness of the material.\nProvided that the drop does not spread too thinly, this condi-\ntion is met for both the drop and the substrate during their rapid\ncontact.\nBy imposing the condition that the two bodies have an\nequal contact temperature during contact time, the standard\nheat equation can be solved analytically (33), revealing a\ntime-independent contact surface temperature of T(z = 0, t) =\n\u0000p\n(kρcp)ℓTℓ+\np\n(kρcp)sTs\n\u0001\u000e\u0000p\n(kρcp)ℓ+\np\n(kρcp)s\n\u0001\n. Here\ncp is the speciﬁc heat and the subscripts s and ℓdenote the prop-\nerties of the substrate and liquid, respectively. It follows from\nthe self-similar analysis that the heat ﬂux into the substrate is\n˙q(t) = ks(Ts −T(z = 0, t))/√παst. Combining the relations for\nthe heat ﬂux and the contact radius, the amount of heat trans-\nferred Q =\nR tr\n0 ˙q(t)πr(t)2dt is\nQ = 2.8\nksρℓ\n1/4(rm/R)2∆T\nγ1/4√αs\n\u0010\n1 +\np\n(ρcpk)s/(ρcpk)ℓ\n\u0011R11/4.\n[2]\nFrom a scaling perspective, Eq. 2 is equivalent to the relation\nQ/∆T ∼R2.75 presented in the previous section and thus also\nconsistent with the data in Fig. 3A. However, in addition to pro-\nviding a coefﬁcient, Eq. 2 also provides falsiﬁable predictions\ninto how the spreading factor and material properties of the liq-\nuid and the substrate affect the heat transferred.\nA natural way to nondimensionalize the transferred heat Q is\nto normalize it by the maximum possible heat transfer mcp∆T,\nwhere m is a drop mass. Noting that m = 4\n3πR3ρℓ, the normal-\nized heat exchange can be expressed as\nQ\nmcp∆T = 0.7\n\u0010rm\nR\n\u00112 \u0010\n1\n1 + M\n\u0011 \u0012ρℓα2\nℓ\nRγ\n\u00131/4\n.\n[3]\nIn this form, it becomes clear that for a given spreading fac-\ntor, the model predicts that the fraction of potential heat trans-\nferred is controlled by two dimensionless parameters: one relat-\ning the thermal-inertial capillary dynamics of the drop ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ\nand the other relating the thermal properties of the material\nM = kℓ√αs/ks√αℓ.\nExperiments\nA\nB\nFig. 4.\nComparison between model and experiment. (A) The model\nassumes that during the residence time tr, the temperatures of the drop\nTℓand solid Ts contact along a plane z = 0 and the heat transfer leads\nto self-similar temperature proﬁles T(z, t). (B) For a given spreading fac-\ntor rm/R (symbol color), the portion of energy exchanged depends on two\ndimensionless groups, one based on dynamic properties ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ and the\nother on material thermal properties M (symbol shape). The experimental\ndata (symbols) are consistent with the theoretical results with rm/R = 1.4\n(solid lines).\nThe ﬁrst dimensionless group identiﬁed in our analysis,\nρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ, may be interpreted as the square of the ratio of\nresidence time tr ∼\np\nρℓR3/γ to the thermal diffusion time\ntd ∼R2/αℓ. For millimeter water drops, ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ is of the order\nof 10−7, which implies that the drop bounces ∼2,000 times faster\nthan the time needed for the heat to thermally diffuse across the\ndrop. The stark difference in timescales supports the semiinﬁ-\nnite approximation. Furthermore, the scaling highlights the com-\npeting inﬂuence of drop size. A larger drop will have a longer\nresidence time than a smaller drop; yet the increase in diffu-\nsion time is greater and therefore the ratio of these timescales\ntr/td decreases. These two timescales become comparable for\nsufﬁciently small drops; yet for water, this size is less than a\nnanometer or near the molecular scale. Therefore, we would\nexpect ρℓα2\nℓ/Rγ ≪1 for most water drops and comparable\nliquids.\nThe other control parameter identiﬁed in our analysis is\nthe material factor deﬁned as M = kℓ√αs/ks√αℓ. This factor\nrelates the thermal heat transfer between the liquid and the sub-\nstrate and therefore depends solely on the thermal properties of\nthese two materials. If the substrate transfers heat signiﬁcantly\nfaster than the drop, then the heat transfer is rate limited by the\ndrop and M →0; whereas if the substrate transfers heat slower\nthan the drop, then the heat transfer is rate limited by the sub-\nstrate and M →∞. For a water drop on a glass substrate, the\nrelative heat transfer rates are comparable and M = 1.\nThe experimental results illustrated in Fig. 3 are rescaled in\nterms of the dimensionless groups presented in Eq. 3 alongside\nthe theoretical prediction for a spreading factor of rm/R = 1.4\nShiri and Bird\nPNAS\n|\nJuly 3, 2017\n|\nvol. 114\n|\nno. 27\n|\n6933\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 92.30.172.63 on June 24, 2025 from IP address 92.30.172.63."

The textbook by \nBevel and Gardner does not mention the likelihood ratio either \n[43]. In their chapter on court testimony, the word uncertainty \nis not mentioned. The closest is a discussion about the determi-\nnation of angles of impact from stain inspection, where the au-\nthors mention error rates while possibly meaning uncertainty. The \nchapter also involves a statement mistrusting the legal system and \novervaluing the work of the bloodstain pattern analysis: “It is clear \nand apparent that the legal system as a whole has forgotten that \ntruth is truth.”\nApproaches based on LRs may take years to propagate into the \nmethods used in crime scene reconstruction and court testimony: \nthe culture of certainty needs to change; new methods need to be \ndesigned and validated based on research findings; the associated \nuncertainties need to be quantified; practitioners need to be trained \nto the new methods; and standards of accreditation need to account \nfor these changes.\n5  |  EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF LR IN BPA\nSince BPA is about activities involving reconstructed measure-\nments (such as time and location), this creates opportunities to \napply LRs in BPA. Remember that the LR applies to any situation \nwhere the observations are weighted against each other in the \nlight of two propositions whatever these are. Careful inspection of \nthe first column of Table 1 shows that many topics of BPA inves-\ntigations are not about quantifying the likelihood of one proposi-\ntion, but rather about providing a measurement, such as a location \n(rows #1, 2), speed (#2), volume (#4), or time (#5) and its meaning \nin the context of the alleged circumstances. The opportunity to \nuse measurements to evaluate LRs can be illustrated by the re-\ncent work by Smith et al. [54]. In a laboratory setting, they esti-\nmated the time duration t between the generation of a blood pool \nand the observation of the drying blood pool via high-­resolution \nphotographs. They developed a physical model that estimates t \nbased on the following evidential observations: time-­stamped \nphotographs, with scale, of the shape, size of the blood pool, na-\nture of the surface on which the blood pool resides, and climate \nmeasurements. While the study acknowledges that “many ques-\ntions remain” [54], the proposed estimate is based on a physical \nmodel established from transport equations that describe how a \ncomplex fluid like blood flows, and how the mass and temperature \nof the blood pool evolve. While the data and results are currently \npreliminary, a detailed data collection plan is presented to quan-\ntify the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the time. \nLet us fast forward a few years and assume that these additional \ndevelopments of the method have been successfully done; that \nthe assumption of normality has been verified; that uncertainty \nhas been quantified; and that the model can be applied to crime \nscenes. Assume that such model applied to a given crime scene \nestimates the time t = 480 min ± a*18 min, where we set a = 1 to \nobtain a 68.27% confidence interval (based on normality). If the \nproposition of the prosecution (Hp) is that t < 7 h (420 min), and \nthat of the defense that t > 7 h (Hd), it would be easy to express \nthe likelihood ratio of the evidence under either proposition (see \nalso [82]). The LR is\nThis value of the LR means that the findings are 2330 times more \nlikely if the defense proposition is true than if the prosecution prop-\nosition is true.\nNote that a frequentist approach is used in the above illustration \nabout how LRs can be used in BPA. While the use of LRs in forensic \nscience has often been associated with a Bayesian approach to sta-\ntistics, there is no requirement to assign LRs using a full Bayesian \nmethodology. For instance, the above illustrative example does not \nrequire the determination of a prior, the value of which is rarely \nuniversally accepted. Besides illustrating how LRs can be used in \nBPA, the above discussion on Ref. [54] illustrates how the scientific \nmethod (here fluid dynamics and experiment design) helps deter-\nmine the data that need to be collected. Indeed, without knowledge \nof the intricacies of the complex, multistage, and multidimensional \ndrying process of a complex fluid like blood, a brute force data col-\nlection approach might not have identified the relevant data to col-\nlect (here the ratio of wet vs. total area of the pool and its perimeter) \nand might not have been able to subsume those contributions in \na single algebraic equation based on physical principles. Note also \nthat, physics-­based methods such as the use of dimensionless num-\nbers can reduce the amount of data to collect by several orders of \nmagnitude [66,83].\nSimilar considerations can be done regarding the determination \nof the height of a blood source, or its distance from a wall, as long \nas the reconstructed measurement is provided in a physically and \nstatistically sound way [60,84]. These illustrations show that the LR \napplies to BPA, at least in principle. Finally, LR approaches may be \ndeveloped on the sole basis of extensive and representative statis-\ntical analysis of findings associated with real casework, such as the \nsurvey by Briggs for extraneous blood on clothing [85].\n6  |  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the LR framework is applicable to BPA, but that \nit is a complex task to do. A structural reason for this complexity \nis the scope of BPA, which is about evaluations at the level of ac-\ntivities rather than source. A conjectural reason is about the state \nof the art of BPA-­related fundamental knowledge, data, and train-\ning material. To facilitate applications of LR in BPA evaluations, it \nis proposed to develop the discipline along three directions: better \nphysical understanding, solid and available data, and appropriate \ntraining.

(b) Deﬁnition of the angle of drop impact α and directional\n(sideways) angle γ , which is equal to the angle between the vertical plane containing the drop trajectory and\nanother vertical plane containing the bullet trajectory and the target.\nAs stated in 1939 in Ref. [4], reconstructing trajectories is very difﬁcult and still is today. A\nﬁrst-order approach to reconstruct trajectories is to assume that the drops travel in a straight line\n[1]. Reconstruction methods based on straight trajectories, such as the method of strings or the\ntrigonometric method, have been used in crime scene reconstruction since at least the 1950s [5] and\nimplemented in software routinely used in crime scenes analysis [6–10]. There is abundant BPA\nliterature on the uncertainties associated with the choice of stains and their inspection to determine\nthe angle of impact and area of origin, as reviewed in Ref. [3]. The actual trajectories are curved, due\nto the effect of gravity, which is ampliﬁed by the air drag. Since gravity and drag act, respectively,\nvertically and parallel to the trajectory, it is valid to assume that the projection of the trajectories on\na horizontal plane consists of straight lines. This justiﬁes the use of straight lines to determine the\nregion of convergence.\nHowever, the use of straight lines to predict the vertical position of the source, i.e., the region\nof origin, involves a systematic error. For instance, [11,12] report errors in the determination of the\nregion of origin. Similarly, [13] veriﬁes experimentally that the method of strings “[overestimates]\nthe height of the point of origin and the error associated with this technique is signiﬁcant (50% on\naverage).”\nRecently, BPA research has proposed methods to reconstruct curved trajectories. Reference [14]\ndescribes “a method of reconstructing the area of origin in a nonlinear manner” and incorporates\nthe effects of drag in trajectory calculations using probability densities. A statistical procedure\n[15] based on aggregate statistics and the basic equations of projectile motion have been shown to\ndetermine the area of origin of a blood spatter for cases when the spatter is launched within a narrow\nrange of polar angles. Since ballistic reconstruction involves the knowledge of impact velocity and\ndrop size, a signiﬁcant amount of recent BPA work has focused on obtaining that information by\ninspecting the stains, as proposed in Ref. [16]. The authors of [17] reconstructed drop trajectories\nusing ballistic calculations, considering gravity and drag forces, and determined the region of origin\nwith about four times higher accuracy than under the assumption of straight trajectories.\nIt should be emphasized that none of the existing theories used for predictions of blood trajectories\naddress basic questions such as what the physical mechanism of drop formation in blood spatter is\nand how it determines the drop size distribution and the initial velocities and angles.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons).

Lesser showed analytically [145] that during impact, the\nonset of sideways jetting of liquid from beneath the drop will be\ndelayed by an elastic response of the wall, a phenomenon\nconﬁrmed experimentally [146]. Rein [128] reviews that the\nelastic response of most surfaces has no inﬂuence at low velocities,\nbut becomes important during high-speed impacts.\nImportantly, the wetting angle (see Fig. 2) is not a constant\nduring impact as described in [133]. The wetting angle is also\nfunction of the direction of motion of the wetting line (advancing\nor receding), and of the relative speed between the wetting line\nand the substrate (or the capillary number). This dynamic behavior\nof the wetting angle inﬂuences the spreading and is still a topic of\ncurrent FD research [133,147–150].\nUpon impact, the liquid contained in the drop might fully or\npartially bounce away from the wall [126,151–153]. A correlation\nin [154] predicts the volume of Newtonian liquid that will be\nretained on a solid surface, based on the difference (or hysteresis)\nbetween receding and advancing wetting angles.\nThe impact of drops on liquid surfaces has been reviewed in\n[128], and involves the deformation by the impacting drop of the\nfree surface of the liquid into a liquid sheet. That protruding liquid\nsheet, sometimes in the form of a crown, might break up into drops,\nby instability mechanisms described in Section 3.2. Impact on\nliquid surfaces is important for basic FD studies on, for example,\nthe noise of rain, and also for drip patterns in BPA.\n6. Staining\nThis section focuses on how the stain forms, after the impact\nhas deformed the drop. In other words, non-inertial aspects of the\nﬂuid transport are discussed, since inertial aspects (spread factor,\nimpact angle, ﬁngering, splashing) associated with the impact have\nalready been discussed.\n6.1. Description in the BPA literature\nThe uneven thickness of stains was described by Balthazard et al.\n[42], who noticed that the periphery of stains is typically thicker\nthan their center. The authors guessed (rightly as shown in the late\n1990s [155]) that the depressed center is rather due to some\nphenomenon occurring during the drying phase rather than to the\npresence of air bubbles in the impacting drop. The same work [42]\ncommented on the presence of scale-like structures in the crust of\nthe stain, and noticed that the appearance of the crust depends on\nthe \ntype \nof \nblood \nused, \neither \nreal \nblood \nor \nblood \nwith\nanticoagulant. They also mentioned that stains resulting from\noblique impact are inhomogeneous, the bottom part being ‘‘crust-\nlike’’ and dark, while the upper part is pink.\nBalthazard et al. [42] also studied how capillary forces drive\nblood into fabrics, noticing faster imbibition rates along the ﬁbers\nthan across. Kirk [120] also notes that some bloodstains go straight\nfrom the generation to the staining phase, describing the case of a\nstabbed woman whose blood had ﬂowed between her breasts and\ninto her clothing.\nDuring drying, stains might suddenly detach from certain\ntargets. This alteration process called delamination or warping is\ncaused by radial stresses due to the shrinkage of the stain, which\novercome adhesive forces between the blood and target. This effect\noccurs on smooth plastic sheets, but not on some rougher plastics\nas described in [42]. Another alteration process is described in the\nfascinating study [157] on how insects modify the shape of existing\nbloodstains or create artifact bloodstains.\nKirk [120] also describes methods to identify if a bloodstain\ncomes from the perpetrator or from the victim (a question\nresolved later by genetic testing), as well as methods to spot\nbloodstains on backgrounds where stains do not stand out.\nSeveral chemical, physical or optical methods have recently been\ndeveloped in BPA for detecting weakly visible stains, using\nfunctionalized nanoparticles [158] or Raman scattering [159], and\nfor determining the age of bloodstains, as reviewed by Bremmer\net al. [160].\n6.2. Fluid dynamics description\nBlood is not only a ﬂuid containing particles (complex ﬂuid), it is\nalso a ﬂuid initiating coagulation as soon as it ﬂows out of the\nhuman body. Once the kinetic energy associated with the impact\nhas dissipated, the formation of a stain on a solid, impermeable\ntarget, depends on the following physical processes: wettability\n[161], evaporation, viscous dissipation, diffusion and coagulation.\nReference [162] discusses the relationship between the rheology of\nthe blood and the stages of blood clotting. Reference [12] describes\nthe effects of various anticoagulants on the trail length left by a\ndrop running along an inclined surface.\nThe formation of stains during the drying of complex ﬂuids has\nrecently become the focus of ﬂuid dynamics studies motivated\neither by the ubiquity of this natural phenomenon, or by\nmanufacturing applications of evaporative self-assembly. For\ninstance, the formation of rings at the periphery of stains has\nbeen explained in [155] by the combination of a radial ﬂow driven\nby enhanced evaporation at the wetting line, and pinning of the\nsame wetting line by accumulation of particles carried by the radial\nFig. 11. A magniﬁed stain reveals a wealth of features; some of these features, such as cracks in the corona, are of interest to determine the impact or drying conditions.

Determination of the directions and angles of impact and the centres of origin\nThe direction of impact and the vertical ﬂight path plane in the room can be\ndetermined by using the angle of impact and the directionality of the bloodstain. The\nangle of impact of the blood drop, which is formed between the direction of the blood\ndrop and the ﬂatsurfacethat is struck, is calculated basedon the relationship between\nthe length of the major and minor axes of the elliptical bloodstain. In addition, the\ndirectionality of the bloodstain is ascertained from the longitudinal axis of the ellipse\nand the direction in which the spin points (Fig. 5). In this manner, the directionality\nandlength of the major and minoraxes of the ellipseof all well-deﬁned bloodstains on\nwalls, ceilings and on furniture that has not been removed are accurately measured.\nBased on these measurements, the assumed straight line for the ﬂight path of the\nbloodstains is calculated and drawn in the 3D model of the crime scene using CAD\nsoftware. To reduce errors in determinating impact angles, only bloodstains with low\nimpact angles have been considered in the analysis [13–15].\nIn a top view of the impact directions of the bloodstains, convergence areas are\nshown in groups of straight lines in high concentration, which intersect one\nanother.\nThese\nconvergence\nareas\nare\npossible\ncentres\nof\norigin\nfor\nthe\ncorresponding bloodstains. In a side view, the height of the centres of origin is\ndetermined by ﬁnding the average intersections of only the straight lines of the\nbloodstains which occur at a short distance from the blood source location.\nThe photogrammetry software Elcovision 10 in combination with the AutoCAD\nsoftware performs an automatic calculation of all measured ellipses and draws the\ncalculated straight lines of the directions of impact of the bloodstains in the 3D\nmodel of the crime scene. Then the centres of origin are determined automatically\nby software, or manually, based on the produced 3D model.\n2.6. Ballistic determination of the trajectory of the blood spatter\nFor the determination of the blood source location, the trajectories of\nbloodstains, which are of a short distance from the blood drop origin, can be\nassumed as straight lines.\nIn cases of longer distance, a difference in the vertical component between the\nspatial direction of impact (in the vertical plane) and the expected centre of origin\narises, because of the curved trajectory of the drop. In these cases a ballistic\ndetermination of the trajectory of a blood drop is performed in order to show\nwhether these bloodstains arise from the determined centre of origin or from a\ndifferent origin.\n[(Fig._2)TD$FIG]\nFig. 2. 3D documentation of the crime scene.

This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation\nnow (mis)printed as\nReI / ðRe1=2We1=4Þ0:75\nð11Þ\nhereafter referred to as ReIM.\nHowever, the above work only considered the vertical impact of\nblood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-\nface. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the\nvertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little\nwork on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either\nonto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45\u0002\nto validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the\nflow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).\nBy looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper\nthis paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine\nthe impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for\nwhich the vertical impact is simply a special case.\nExperimental Technique\nAs in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has\nbeen shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood\nwas mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.\nBlood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood\nto be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37\u0002C and removed\nonly when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were\ncarried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in\na fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at\nthe end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),\nviscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)\nfor pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).\nThe blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at\nheights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,\nresulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-\nette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-\nferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–\n5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting\nof blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically\nto impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give\nimpact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90\u0002 to the hori-\nzontal. For the 22.7\u0002 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used\nand for the small pipette at 90\u0002 to the horizontal, extra heights of\n20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-\nard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,\nand surface slope was repeated six times.\nThe last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-\ntom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at\n1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured\nusing the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera\nsoftware version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly\nusing the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the\ndroplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that\nif inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it\nwas taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size\nwas measured and the number of spines around the entire stain\n(360\u0002) was counted by hand. For each angle and height, the results\nwere averaged over the six replicates. The stain size and number of\nspines were then plotted against a number of variables to obtain a\ncorrelation coefficient.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the effect of impact angle on the number of\nspines obtained and the stain size and shape. As shown in previous\nwork (1), as the impact angle increases, i.e., becomes closer to a\nvertical impact, the stain becomes shorter, until for a vertical\nimpact a circular stain is generated (Fig. 1a). What has not been\ndiscussed before is that the number of spines also alters as the\nimpact angle alters. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the number of\nspines increases as the impact angle increases. As the drop size or\nimpact velocity increase the stain size and number of spines also\nincreases for an angled impact, Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, as pre-\nviously demonstrated in Ref. (17) for a vertical impact.\nVertical Impact\nTo compare the results against work by previous authors, at first\nonly vertical impacts were considered with the correlation coeffi-\ncients, R2, given in Table 1 for stain size and Table 2 for number\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFIG. 1—Blood stains falling from 100 cm for a medium sized pipette at\nangles of (a) 90\u0002, (b) 78.8\u0002, (c) 61.6\u0002, (d) 43.5\u0002, and (e) 33.7\u0002 to the vertical.\nKNOCK AND DAVISON\n• POSITION OF THE SOURCE OF BLOOD STAINS\n1045\n 15564029, 2007, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00505.x by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

One\nreconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes\nan automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes.\nClassification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data\nsets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and\nperform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting\nthe stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at dis-\ntances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter pat-\nterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, classification, impact spatters, gunshot spatters, spatter pattern, machine learning,\nimage analysis, random forests, feature engineering\nSee Comment here\nSee Authors’ Response here\nA bloodstain pattern is an ensemble of bloodstains. Stains are\nmarks that can be observed on a solid surface called a target. A\nblood spatter pattern is produced by drops from a blood source\nwhich have traveled through the air before reaching a target surface,\nsuch as a wall or the cardstock used in this study. Bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) has been used in US criminal courts since the sec-\nond half of last century (1–3). BPA interprets the bloodstain patterns\nin a crime scene in order to provide evidence to support the crime\nscene reconstruction (3,4). Typically, BPA uses principles of phy-\nsics, statistics, biology, and mathematics. Example reconstruction\nquestions are as follows: “What is the mechanism causing the\nbloodstain patterns? Where is the origin of the blood source?”\nRegarding the latter question, established methods based on\nthe assumption of straight trajectories are widely used to predict\nthe region of origin of a blood spatter pattern (5,6). Reference\n(7) proposed a method to improve the determination of the blood\nsource location, and Varney et al. (8) introduced a plot-based\nmethod to locate the blood source. Further, Camana et al. (9)\nused a probabilistic approach to identify the horizontal projection\nof the location of the blood source.\nWhile there have been multiple academic efforts to estimate the\nlocation of the blood source, less attention has been given to deter-\nmine the mechanism causing the spatter pattern. A question of\ninterest is whether the spatter patterns were caused by a bullet or\nblunt impact. Classifying the bloodstain patterns helps support\nother evidences such as weapons or bullet marks found on the\ncrime scene. Stain size is used in Ref. (3) to classify spatter pat-\nterns between high-velocity spatter patterns, usually generated\nfrom gunshot, and medium-velocity blood spatter patterns, that is,\ngenerated from blunt impacts of club, axe, hammer, fist, and brick.\nThey observed in their experiment that “many” stains in a med-\nium-velocity spatter pattern exhibit 1/8 inch diameter or smaller,\nwhile “essentially all” stains in a high-velocity spatter pattern have\ndiameters smaller than 1/8 inch. James et al. (10) presents the tra-\nditional method of distinguishing medium- and high-velocity\nimpact spatter patterns based on a hypothetical correlation between\nthe velocity of the generation mechanism and the size of resulting\nbloodstains. They stated that “medium-velocity impact spatters\n(MVIS) are bloodstains created when the source of blood is sub-\njected to a force with a velocity in the range of 5 to 25 ft/sec. The\ndiameters of the resulting stains are in the size range of 1 to 3 mm,\nalthough smaller and larger stains may be present. Stains in this\ncategory were usually associated with beatings and stabbings.” On\nthe other hand, “High velocity impact spatters (HVIS) are blood-\nstains created when the source of blood is subjected to a force with\nvelocity of greater than 100 ft/sec. The diameters of the spatters\nare predominately less than 1 mm, although smaller and larger\nstains are often observed....”\nThere is currently no widely accepted method to discriminate\nbetween\ngunshot\nand\nimpact\npatterns,\nand\nthe\nforensic\n1Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Atanasoff Hall,\n2434 Osborn Dr, Ames, 50011, IA.\n2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, 2025\nBlack Engineering, Ames, 50011, IA.\n3Department of Statistics, Iowa State University, 2438 Osborn Dr, Ames,\n50011, IA.\nCorresponding author: Yu Liu, Ph.D. E-mail: liuyu0jlu@gmail.com\n[Correction added 16 January 2020.

This\nmanuscript describes a method to reconstruct the motion, or swing, of the object. The method is based on\nstain inspection and Euclidean geometry. The reconstructed swing is represented as a three-dimensional\nregion of statistical likelihood. The reconstruction uncertainty corresponds to the volume of the\nreconstructed region, which is speciﬁc to the uncertainties of the case at hand. Simple numerical\nexamples show that the reconstruction method is able to reconstruct multiple swings that are either\nintersecting or adjacent to each other. The robustness, spatial convergence, computing time of the\nreconstruction method is characterized. For the purpose of this study, about 20 cast-off experiments are\nproduced, with motion of the swinging object documented using video and/or accelerometers. The\nswings follow circular or arbitrary paths, and are either human- or machine-made. The reconstruction\nresults are compared with the experimentally documented swings. Agreement between measured and\nreconstructed swings is very good, typically within less than 10 cm. The method used in this study is\nimplemented as a numerical code written in an open source language, provided in an open access\nrepository, for purposes of transparency and access.\n© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of bloodstain pattern analysis, a cast-off\nspatter pattern is deﬁned as “a bloodstain pattern resulting from\nblood drops released from an object due to its motion” [1]. Cast-off\nspatters occur when non-gravitational inertial forces overcome the\ncapillary forces retaining blood on an object experiencing linear or\nrotational acceleration. In the latter case, the inertial forces are\ncalled centrifugal forces. Cast-off patterns are characterized with\nlinear or curvilinear stain distributions [2]. Cast-off patterns tend\nto be elongated, as compared to impact spatter that exhibit radial\ndispersions as shown in Fig. 1(a) [3]. Other occurrences of cast-off\nspatters involve water or mud projection by vehicle wheels. The\nscope of this manuscript is focused on spatters relevant to\nbloodstain pattern analysis.\nThe dynamics of cast-off formation have been well documented\n[2,4–9]. Blood adhering by capillary forces on a swinging object\ndetaches when centrifugal forces become large enough to balance\ncapillary forces. The detaching drops leave the swinging object\ntangentially to its swing, with an initial velocity equal in\nmagnitude and direction to that of the weapon at the instant of\ndetachment. The trajectories of the drops are then controlled by\ngravitational and drag forces. They can be described with Newton’s\nsecond law of motion. While several studies have described the\nreconstruction of impact spatter patterns [10–15], where the area\nof origin of the blood is assumed to be static, there is currently no\navailable method to reconstruct the trajectory of the swinging\nobject that generates a cast-off spatter pattern. Current recon-\nstruction methods for impact spatter patterns are called method of\nstrings or tangent method, assume the blood drops travel in straight\ntrajectories from the impacted blood source to the stain impact\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: scott.thomas.mccleary@gmail.com (S.

Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using\nlarger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can\nobscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).\nBlood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nLaan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can\nhelp pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).\nThe splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical\nS-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in\nFigure 8.\n5.

The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &\nBourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or\nspatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

One\nreconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes\nan automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes.\nClassification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data\nsets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and\nperform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting\nthe stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at dis-\ntances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter pat-\nterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, classification, impact spatters, gunshot spatters, spatter pattern, machine learning,\nimage analysis, random forests, feature engineering\nSee Comment here\nSee Authors’ Response here\nA bloodstain pattern is an ensemble of bloodstains. Stains are\nmarks that can be observed on a solid surface called a target. A\nblood spatter pattern is produced by drops from a blood source\nwhich have traveled through the air before reaching a target surface,\nsuch as a wall or the cardstock used in this study. Bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) has been used in US criminal courts since the sec-\nond half of last century (1–3). BPA interprets the bloodstain patterns\nin a crime scene in order to provide evidence to support the crime\nscene reconstruction (3,4). Typically, BPA uses principles of phy-\nsics, statistics, biology, and mathematics. Example reconstruction\nquestions are as follows: “What is the mechanism causing the\nbloodstain patterns? Where is the origin of the blood source?”\nRegarding the latter question, established methods based on\nthe assumption of straight trajectories are widely used to predict\nthe region of origin of a blood spatter pattern (5,6). Reference\n(7) proposed a method to improve the determination of the blood\nsource location, and Varney et al. (8) introduced a plot-based\nmethod to locate the blood source. Further, Camana et al. (9)\nused a probabilistic approach to identify the horizontal projection\nof the location of the blood source.\nWhile there have been multiple academic efforts to estimate the\nlocation of the blood source, less attention has been given to deter-\nmine the mechanism causing the spatter pattern. A question of\ninterest is whether the spatter patterns were caused by a bullet or\nblunt impact. Classifying the bloodstain patterns helps support\nother evidences such as weapons or bullet marks found on the\ncrime scene. Stain size is used in Ref. (3) to classify spatter pat-\nterns between high-velocity spatter patterns, usually generated\nfrom gunshot, and medium-velocity blood spatter patterns, that is,\ngenerated from blunt impacts of club, axe, hammer, fist, and brick.\nThey observed in their experiment that “many” stains in a med-\nium-velocity spatter pattern exhibit 1/8 inch diameter or smaller,\nwhile “essentially all” stains in a high-velocity spatter pattern have\ndiameters smaller than 1/8 inch. James et al. (10) presents the tra-\nditional method of distinguishing medium- and high-velocity\nimpact spatter patterns based on a hypothetical correlation between\nthe velocity of the generation mechanism and the size of resulting\nbloodstains. They stated that “medium-velocity impact spatters\n(MVIS) are bloodstains created when the source of blood is sub-\njected to a force with a velocity in the range of 5 to 25 ft/sec. The\ndiameters of the resulting stains are in the size range of 1 to 3 mm,\nalthough smaller and larger stains may be present. Stains in this\ncategory were usually associated with beatings and stabbings.” On\nthe other hand, “High velocity impact spatters (HVIS) are blood-\nstains created when the source of blood is subjected to a force with\nvelocity of greater than 100 ft/sec. The diameters of the spatters\nare predominately less than 1 mm, although smaller and larger\nstains are often observed....”\nThere is currently no widely accepted method to discriminate\nbetween\ngunshot\nand\nimpact\npatterns,\nand\nthe\nforensic\n1Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Atanasoff Hall,\n2434 Osborn Dr, Ames, 50011, IA.\n2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, 2025\nBlack Engineering, Ames, 50011, IA.\n3Department of Statistics, Iowa State University, 2438 Osborn Dr, Ames,\n50011, IA.\nCorresponding author: Yu Liu, Ph.D. E-mail: liuyu0jlu@gmail.com\n[Correction added 16 January 2020.

INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁngering of an ink blot or a coffee stain is familiar to everyone. However, despite 140 years\nof study (Worthington 1876), the underlying rapid dynamics of the impact process eluded expla-\nnation until the past 20 years, when high-speed video technology began to allow time-resolved\nobservations of this intriguing phenomenon (Thoroddsen et al. 2008). The increasing pace of sen-\nsor improvements and availability is allowing the study of ever-ﬁner detail and is reinvigorating\nresearch in this area of study, as demonstrated by the large number of very recent references cited\nherein. This imaging technology is now reaching the diffraction limit of spatial resolution and sub-\nmicrosecond interframe times (Li & Thoroddsen 2015, Visser et al. 2015). This is being matched\nby increasing computational power and improved numerical algorithms to allow fully resolved\nsimulations in the axisymmetric conﬁguration (Thoraval et al. 2012), and fully three-dimensional\n(3D) cases, from ﬁrst contact, should soon follow (Agbaglah et al. 2011).\nWe strictly conﬁne our review to impacts on solid surfaces and leave out studies involving\nimpacts on pools or ﬁlms of liquid. Moreover, we emphasize recent works [i.e., appearing after\nthe earlier review by Yarin (2006) in this journal, which dealt with impacts on both solid and\nliquid surfaces].\nStudies of drop impacts are driven by several areas relevant both in nature and in industry.\nIn nature, a drop of water hollows a stone, and splashing produces aerosols, causes erosion, and\nbrings the smell of the earth during rain ( Joung & Buie 2015). In industry, there are spray/wall\ninteractions in coating, cleaning, cooling, and combustion. Inkjet droplets play an increasing role\nin fabrication, from the soldering of electronics to microarrays in biotechnology.\nFigure 1 presents some iconic images of impacting drops, including sketches by Worthington\naround the dawn of photography.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Results\nThe proposed ABPA method was applied to 132 cast-off, 208 impact \nand 132 expirated patterns that were generated in the laboratory as \npreviously described in Section 2, and the outputted results scrutinised \nby a trained BPA analyst.\n4.1. Segmentation\nAll bloodstains that were able to be visually identified by the analyst \nin the outputted image file were annotated by the method. This included \nvery small stains less than 0.5 mm in diameter. However some false \npositives were detected, such as staple holes and shadows at the edge of \nsome images. Any markings from rulers not completely cropped out \nwould also be identified as stains as would any non-circular pins present \nin the image.\n4.2. Comparison with ImageJ\nThree patterns from each class (expirated, cast-off and impact) rep­\nresenting a variety of different stains numbers, sizes and intensities were \nanalysed with both ImageJ (using the auto thresholding function) and \nthe proposed ABPA method and the number of stains identified with \neach were compared. As ImageJ did not have a minimum stain size, a \ncount of stains greater than 4 pixels was calculated for the ImageJ results \nfor comparisons which are noted in Table 2. It is noted that there was a \nbig difference between stain numbers for impact pattern 14 and expi­\nrated pattern 87 between the two methods, with the proposed ABPA \nmethod detecting more stains than ImageJ. When qualitatively \ncomparing the binary output of ImageJ with the pattern overlay output \nof the ABPA method it is apparent that ImageJ is not detecting all of the \nstains in the image.\nFor impact 14 a larger volume of blood was used resulting in larger \nand darker stains within the pattern. As a result, the thresholding for \nImageJ is not detecting the smaller and fainter stains (Fig. 6). Likewise, \nfor the expirated pattern 87, due to the blood substitute being a paler \ncolour and then further diluted with saliva during the spitting action to \ncreate the pattern, many of the stains are pale and these are not all being \ndetected by ImageJ.\nThe propsed ABPA method also coped better with shadows and un­\neven lighting. For expirated pattern 53 (Fig. 7) the shadowing on the \nlower portion of the image was counted as stains in ImageJ, and was \nlargely ignored with the proposed ABPA method. This is represented in \nthe total stain count of 8383 with ImageJ, reducing by nearly half to \n4773 when stains less than 5 pixels are removed. This is much more \ncomparable to the 4613 stains identified with the ABPA method. This \nresult also validates our decision to limit noise by having a minimum \nstain size of 5 pixels for the proposed ABPA method.\n4.3. Comparison with Matlab method\nThe impact pattern analysed with the Matlab method in [18] was \nmade available to the authors and was analysed with our developed \nABPA method. The proposed ABPA method detected 1623 stains of 10 \npixels or greater, much more than the 420 labelled elements identified in \nthe original research paper. The improved segmentation process is likely \nto account for the increase in stains detected, as well as the ability of the \nproposed ABPA method to count and measure all stains not just those \nwith fitted ellipses.\nOverall, the results indicate that the proposed ABPA method has a \nreliable and sensitive stain segmentation method that copes well with \nshadows and uneven lighting, and different intensity stains and is an \nimprovement on both the automated thresholding of ImageJ and the \nprevious Matlab developed methodology.\n4.4. Ellipse fitting and bloodstain metrics\nEllipses were fitted well to well-formed elliptical and spherical \nstains. However, as the method attempted to fit ellipses to all stains there \nwere times when very large ellipses were overlayed onto stains, \nparticularly for ones that had flowed, or were overlapping with other \nstains. Examples are shown in Fig. 8. Currently the only solution to \nremove these is to identify these stains using the user interface and \nTable 2 \nComparison of number of stains identified.\nPattern ID\nClass\nTotal stains \nImageJ\n>4 pixels \nImageJ\nTotal stains ABPA\n16c\ncastoff\n110\n98\n103\n103\ncastoff\n12\n11\n11\n133\ncastoff\n344\n233\n281\n14\nimpact\n2747\n1769\n3315\n13\nimpact\n442\n277\n335\n77\nimpact\n1144\n1090\n1133\n87\nexpirated\n241\n176\n575\n9\nexpirated\n11006\n7843\n7780\n53\nexpirated\n8383\n4773\n4613\nFig. 5.

comparative review highlights the relationships between the disciplines of bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) in forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences. In both the BPA and FD\ncommunities, scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air, or with other\nliquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of\nblood as a ﬂuid; the generation of the drops; their ﬂight in the air; their impact on solid or liquid surfaces;\nand the production of stains. For each of these topics, the relevant literature from the BPA community\nand from the FD community is reviewed. Comments are provided on opportunities for joint BPA and FD\nresearch, and on the development of novel FD-based tools and methods for BPA. Also, the use of\ndimensionless numbers is proposed to inform BPA analyses.\n\u0002 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n* Corresponding author.

    "text_chunk": "3.3. Spitting, or nasal snorting, of instilled blood in the semi-prone\nposture\nThe average total numbers of spots on the overalls for each type\nof manoeuvre are shown in Fig. 8. In all experiments, the great\nmajority of spots were less, or much less, than 1 mm diameter.\nSpots were widely distributed on the overalls, but especially to the\nleft arm and chest in the nasal exhalations; they were biased to the\nhips and thighs and the right leg for the spitting exhalations; this\nprobably reﬂected differences in the primary direction of the\nexhaled stream.\nIn Series A, the bulk of the spots were on the left forearm which\nappeared to shield the remaining body regions and the left chest\ntook a reasonable density of droplet hits, the remainder of the body\nwas relatively balanced between left and right sided hits. In Series\nB, the target was moved down from more the face level to chest\nlevel and it would appear that the heaviest capture density was left\nchest to waist. The target had possibly moved more into the ﬁring\nline of the nasal exhalation, which would be expected to be more in\nthis direction than in Series A. This would also explain the\ngenerally higher total counts overall. In Series C, the mouth spit\nwould have been expected to be more directed to the target than\nwas the case for Series A with nasal exhalations. The distribution\nwas relatively balanced left to right.\nThe deposition distributions in the three series relate reason-\nably to the relative positioning and means of exhalation. The fact\nthat the nearer body parts often had the highest spot counts did not\ndiminish the explicitly recorded observation that signiﬁcant\nnumbers of spots were found on the more distant body regions\nthat were in line with the exhalation and not shielded by other\nparts, more proximal to the source.\n3.4. Use of a simpliﬁed physical nose model\nDrops of blood, placed at the distal tip of the nasal tube (Fig. 1,\nposition 1), tended to be propelled only a short distance on\nexhalation, producing only a small amount of spray. The moment\nthe exhalation was initiated, a small amount of spray was\nproduced, blood predominantly fell out of the tube to the ground\nbelow creating a few splashes several millimetres diameter.\nWhen blood was instilled approx. 1 cm behind the tip (position\n2), a different pattern of elimination was observed. The blood ﬁlm\nsurface was torn by the airﬂow and the expelled droplets\ntransported along with the exhaled air. In all cases, the vertical\ntarget surface intercepted many hundreds of very small droplets,\nproducing spots typically much less than 0.5 mm diameter, many\nbeing less than 0.1 mm dia., along with some larger spots. Some\nspots, mainly larger ones, were also detected on the horizontal\ntarget surface. When the nasal tube was inclined upwards, the\ninterception distance was observed to be greater than 1 m for\nmany droplets, both small and large.\nWhen blood was instilled further back within the cavity\n(position 3), the blood ﬁlm was again torn by the emerging airﬂow\ninto droplets of a range of sizes. However, the larger droplets\ntended to impact on the walls of the cavity upstream of the valve,\nleaving a stream of smaller droplets to emerge as before,\ngenerating a pattern of interception on the vertical target of\nalmost entirely small spots with comparatively few being observed\non the horizontal target.\n3.5. General\nWhilst the diameter of the droplets producing the individual\nspots could not be measured directly, the captured blood wetted\nthe paper surface and thus spread to cover an area larger than the\noriginating droplet; in consequence, the measured spot sizes were\ncertainly larger than the droplet diameter.\nThe typical speed of the exhaled air package varied considerably\nbetween the four studies on the basis of the estimated exhaled\nvolumes and periods.

    "text_chunk": "calculations. In this experiment, the stain selection criteria favored\nlarger stains. With this in mind, the larger droplets within the high-\nspeed images were found to be >0.8 mm diameter and traveling\n<3 m⁄sec. Therefore, ignoring drag is expected to introduce no\nmore than 30% error in predicting the z-coordinate in this experi-\nment. This is quite substantial and highlights that any attempt to\nincorporate projectile motion into AO modeling must take drag into\naccount.\nAO error associated with size and xy-coordinate was calculated\nusing the stain triangulation lines at the point with which they\ncrossed the known x-axis, which runs perpendicular to the spatter\nflight direction. For each spatter pattern, the xy-coordinate was\nmeasured as the average offset between each triangulation line and\nthe known xy-coordinate, while AO size was measured as the 95%\nconfidence interval of this average. These calculations are presented\nin Fig. 12.\nNo statistically significant correlations were found between the\nobserved errors, and blood volumes and velocities tested. XY-coor-\ndinates were found to be quite accurate, with the least accurate\nspatter pattern deviating from the known xy-coordinate by only\n4 mm. On the other hand, the AO size was found to be larger than\nexpected. The known blood droplet diameters tested were 2.7 and\n3.2 mm, while the calculated sizes ranged between 7.8 and\n14.3 mm, representing a two- to fivefold increase. Further analysis\nof these results revealed a number of outliers present within each\ntrial. This was investigated further.\nOne of the 24 spatter patterns was selected randomly for addi-\ntional analysis. The stain selection criteria were lowered to include\nstains that could provide a measure of directionality only. This\nresulted in the selection of 54 stains. For the purpose of this analy-\nsis, instead of starting at each stain and triangulating ‘‘backward,’’\nthe known xy-position was used as the starting point and lines were\ndrawn ‘‘forward’’ out to each stain. Where each line overlapped the\ncorresponding stain, the rotational offset could then be evaluated.\nOf these 54 stains, the rotational offsets of 14 (26%) were signifi-\ncant enough that it was reasonable to assume that any individual\ntasked with fitting an ellipse to a bloodstain was unlikely to have\narrived at the same triangulation line. Four of these representative\nstains are shown in Fig. 13 each with their corresponding triangula-\ntion path originating from the known xy-coordinate. This finding\nclearly demonstrates that a component of AO error is not related to\nanalyst measurement but is instead inherent in the process of blood\ndisplacement and disintegration.\nPostimpact droplet formation is the most likely mechanism for\nthis contribution to AO size error. This ‘‘fork in the road’’ effect\noccurs when a blood volume structure (sheet, filament, or large\ndroplet) has traveled a certain distance from the AO and reaches\nan instability threshold where it disintegrates into smaller volumes.\nSubsequently, trajectory lines for these respective bloodstains will\ntriangulate back to this fork in the road where secondary disintegra-\ntion occurred, instead of back to the true AO. Given that this\nexperiment was designed to reduce the complexity of droplet disin-\ntegration, it is likely that this will be more predominant under\nbloodshed conditions more typically associated with crime scenes.\nConclusion\nSmall volumes of blood were disintegrated through the applica-\ntion of pressurized air. The resulting spatter patterns were used to\nevaluate BPA AO error and investigate the underlying mechanisms.\nUnder these experimental conditions, z-coordinate predictions were\nconsistently overestimated by an average of 50%, while using the\nlowest z-coordinate within a spatter pattern reduced this error to\n8%. However, if this value is to be reported, it should be presented\nas an estimate and not as a maximum height calculation. Incorpora-\ntion of projectile motion into z-coordinate calculations was found\nto underestimate by an average of 28%, while velocity predictions\nwere found to be quite accurate when compared with the high-\nspeed photographs. However, the application of projectile motion is\nlimited at this time as an assumption related to launch angle was\nrequired,\nand\nthe\nimpact\nof\ndrag\ncould\nnot\nbe\nignored.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nvelocity (m/sec)\nerror (%)\nD = 0.2mm\nD = 0.4mm\nD = 0.6mm D = 0.8mm\nD = 1.0mm\nD = 1.2mm\nD = 1.4mm\nD = 1.6mm\nFIG. 11—Effect of drag forces on blood droplets between 0.2 and 1.6 mm\nin diameter, traveling up to 10 m ⁄ sec.

Discussion\nBloodstains serve as crucial physical evidence, often providing sig­\nnificant breakthroughs in challenging cases. They not only verify case \nfacts but also play a pivotal role in reconstructing the crime scene and \nrevealing the truth behind criminal activities. To assist crime scene in­\nvestigators in distinguishing impact spatter from fly spots accurately and \nwithout damaging samples, this study employs a transfer learning model \nbased on ResNet-18 to differentiate the two types of bloodstains. The \nexperimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an overall \naccuracy rate of 93 %. These findings indicate that the application of \nresidual neural network-based image recognition techniques in BPA is \nboth feasible and highly accurate. This study holds significant scientific \nvalue and offers promising applications in BPA. Compared to traditional \nmethods, the AI-based approach minimizes human error and mitigates \nthe risk of misjudgment due to variations in expert experience, thereby \nenhancing the objectivity and reliability of the results. Furthermore, this \ntechnology preserves the integrity of the crime scene by automating the \nanalysis of bloodstain images, eliminating the need for direct contact \nwith the evidence. This innovation not only provides an intelligent so­\nlution for BPA but also transforms the conventional, experience-based \nmodel into a data-driven approach. Moreover, this technology has \nsubstantial practical implications for courtroom forensics. Traditional \nBPA methods often face challenges in terms of accuracy and scientific \nvalidity, particularly when expert testimony conflicts with analytical \nresults, which can lead to uncertainty in legal decisions. In contrast, AI \ntechnology yields consistent, reproducible analysis results, thereby \nenhancing the scientific credibility of bloodstain evidence and \nincreasing its acceptance in court, ultimately contributing to the pursuit \nof justice.\nIn this study, real human and mammalian blood was not selected for \nthe experiment, primarily due to the bloodstain simulation experiment \nwas scheduled in October-November 2022 in the period of COVID-19 \ncontrol. During this time, China’s regulations on livestock and animal \nproducts were further strengthened. According to regional laws and \nregulations, it was challenging for individuals to obtain fresh blood from \nfood animal slaughterhouses, such as those for pigs, cows, and sheep. \nConsidering that the primary objective of this study was to classify and \nidentify the morphology of impact spatters and fly spots using the \nResNet-18 model, Zhou et al. [19] found in their experiment, which \nutilized a convolutional neural network to analyze morphological im­\nages of droplet bloodstains, that the morphological characteristics of \nbloodstains could be accurately simulated using red ink instead of blood \nafter conducting several tests. Singh et al. [28] also used fake blood \nmade from Awlata dye in drop experiments and observed bloodstain \npattern at various heights, confirming the relationship between drop \nheight and the formation of satellite stains and spines. In their study, \nthey suggested that researchers and scientists could use fake blood made \nfrom Awlata dye for experimental purposes in future studies. Mean­\nwhile, Byrd et al. [29] and Wang et al. [30] confirmed that adult flies can \nsurvive on sucrose and milk, making it feasible to use sucrose-enriched \nartificial blood combined with milk to feed flies during the fly spots \nsimulation experiment. Due to the presence of pigments and honey in \nthe fake theatrical blood provided to the flies, they may be unable to \ndigest or regurgitate the fake blood as effectively as they do real blood. \nHowever, our observations confirmed that adult flies could regurgitate \nand excrete simultaneously while feeding. In summary, the results of \nthis simulation experiment, using fake theatrical blood instead of real \nblood, should be sufficient for analysis. Additionally, this study opted to \nstrike blood pools with a blunt object, a scenario more commonly seen in \nhomicide cases, while simulating impact spatters at various distances. \nThis approach more accurately reproduced the distribution and \nmorphological characteristics of the impact spatters.\nIt is important to note that all bloodstain patterns in this study were \nformed under controlled laboratory conditions, and only impact spatters \nand fly spots were modeled. These two types of bloodstains were not \npresent in the same space and did not interact with each other. However, \nin actual crime scenes involving intentional injuries or homicides, the \ncircumstances can be more complex. Not only is the amount of blood \ngreater, but the variety of bloodstain patterns is also more diverse. The \nidentification process becomes significantly more challenging when \ndifferent bloodstains mix or overlap. As the model developed in this \nFig. 7.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used. A \nconsiderably \nhigher percentage of such findings \nwas reported by Fraenckel and"

    "text_chunk": "Research into the dynamics of fluids other than blood offers\nsome insight into this complex interaction (13–15). It begins when\nan object strikes a liquid source, transferring energy through com-\npression and forcing liquid displacement away from the strike\npoint. The amount of transferred energy will correlate with the\ndegree of fluid displacement. As the liquid undergoes displacement,\nthe ratio of surface area to volume increases. To counter this insta-\nbility, the displaced liquid will either recoil through counteracting\nsurface tension forces or disintegrate into smaller fragments where\nthe energy is great enough. Ultimately, aerodynamic forces govern\ndroplet size. The higher the velocity of blood displacement, the\ngreater the instability created at the liquid–gas interface, resulting\nin the generation of smaller droplets. This provides some support\nfor the current correlations made within the BPA community\nbetween bloodstain size and droplet velocity. Liquid displacement\nis quite complex, however, and not all of the liquid will be travel-\ning at the same velocity. This could result in a variety of droplet\nsizes, in addition to the generation of sheets and filaments. As\nblood has a relatively high viscosity when compared to water, this\nincreased resistance to flow will counteract displacement and\nincrease the probability of encountering sheets and filaments, as\nreadily observed in Fig. 1. Unlike droplets, sheets and filaments are\ninherently unstable because of their higher surface area-to-volume\nratio and will either recoil into a single droplet or further disinte-\ngrate into multiple droplets.\nOnce airborne, droplet flight trajectory is governed by the effects\nof gravity and drag (or air resistance). Gravity results in downward\ndroplet acceleration and can be modeled using the following pro-\njectile motion equations:\nyðtÞ ¼ \u0002 1\n2 gt2 þ voyt þ yo\nð2Þ\nvyðtÞ ¼ \u0002gt þ voy\nð3Þ\nayðtÞ ¼ \u0002g\nð4Þ\nvxðtÞ ¼ vox ¼ vo cos ho\nð5Þ\nxðtÞ ¼ vxot þ xo\nð6Þ\naxðtÞ ¼ 0\nð7Þ\ntan h ¼ vy\nvx\nð8Þ\nThe force applied to the body of a droplet in motion by the sur-\nrounding air is called drag and acts in the opposite direction of\ndroplet motion. The value of drag force can be calculated using the\nfollowing equation:\nFDrag ¼ CD\n1\n2 qairV2 p\n4 D2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\nð9Þ\nwhere q is the fluid density, V is the flow velocity, and D is the\ndroplet diameter. CD is the coefficient of drag, which is a function\nof Reynolds number and depends on the shape of the object. The\nReynolds number for a sphere is defined as:\nRe ¼ qDoVo\nl\nð10Þ\nwhere D is the droplet diameter, and l is the fluid viscosity.\nThe aim of this research was to utilize a novel experimental\ndesign to investigate the error associated with the standard calcula-\ntions for AO. Starting with a mock crime scene experimental\napproach, the initial volume of blood was significantly reduced,\nand the disintegration process was propagated through the applica-\ntion of a short burst of pressurized air. These two modifications\nallowed for better resolution of the disintegration process to provide\na window into the underlying mechanisms responsible for AO\nerror.\nMaterials and Methods\nA gas tank filled with pressurized air was connected to a nozzle\nvia stainless steel tubing. A pressure gauge was used to measure\nair pressure, while a solenoid valve with digital pulse generator\nensured a controlled release of air from the nozzle. This apparatus\nwas contained within an aluminum frame structure to allow for ver-\ntical adjustment. Iron plates secured to the structure ensured it\nwould not move during operation. A diagram of this experimental\nsetup is shown in Fig. 2.\nA syringe, mounted within a syringe pump to regulate flow rate,\nwas connected to a stainless steel needle using clear plastic tubing.\nThe syringe and needle were clamped within the apparatus such\nthat a droplet suspended from the needle would be directly within\nthe path of pressurized air released from the nozzle. Pig blood was\nchosen owing to similarities in physical properties with human\nblood. The reader is directed to our previous article for additional\ninformation regarding these properties (10).\nFresh pig blood was obtained from an abattoir (Quality Meat\nPackers, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and stored in test tubes contain-\ning the anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The\nblood was stored at 4\u0003C and was used within 48 h of collection.\nBlood was placed into the syringe pump, which was then utilized\nto deliver a specific volume of blood, resulting in consistent sized\nblood droplets suspended from the needle tip. Droplet diameter was\nmeasured directly from the high-speed images taken immediately\nprior to disintegration, using the needle diameter as a calibration\nreference.

Tulleners a, William D. Ristenpart a,c,*\na Forensic Science Graduate Group, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA\nb Sacramento County Laboratory of Forensic Science, Sacramento, CA 95820, USA\nc Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of California Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA\n1. Introduction\nA correct distinction between bloodstain patterns formed by\n‘‘contact transfer’’ and ‘‘spatter’’ can be essential for the accurate\nreconstruction of events at crime scene where such bloodstain\npatterns are found. The Scientiﬁc Working Group on Bloodstain\nPattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN) deﬁnes a transfer stain as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from contact between a blood-bearing surface\nand another surface’’, whereas spatter stain is deﬁned as ‘‘a\nbloodstain resulting from a blood drop dispersed through the air\ndue to an external force applied to a source of liquid blood’’ [1].\nAlthough these deﬁnitions are clear, the differentiation between\nthem is challenging, especially when the bloodstain is on fabric. As\ncurrently practiced, the interpretations of bloodstain patterns by\nbloodstain pattern analysts are mostly based upon the experience\nlevel of the analysts and the qualitative characteristics of the\nbloodstain patterns. Because of the analysts’ subjective analysis of\nbloodstain patterns found at the crime scene, however, experts\noften provide different interpretations of the same bloodstain\npattern evidence. For example, in Indiana v. Camm [2] the state\ncalled four expert witnesses, all of whom testiﬁed that some of the\nbloodstains on the defendant’s shirt were the result of high-\nvelocity impact spatter. In contrast, the defense called their own\nfour bloodstain analysis expert witnesses, and these four experts\ntestiﬁed that all of the bloodstains on the defendant’s shirt resulted\nfrom contact transfer. A similar example occurred in the Supreme\nCourt of California case People v. McWhorter [3], in which the\nexperts called upon to testify by the prosecution and defense had\ndifferent interpretations of the bloodstains found on a paper towel\ncollected at the crime scene: the defense expert said the stains\nwere ‘‘expectorated’’ (nasal blowing pattern) whereas the prose-\ncutor’s criminalist said the bloodstains were transfer stains.\nSumming matters up, the National Research Council stated in\ntheir recent report that the interpretations of bloodstain pattern\nanalysts ‘‘are more subjective than scientiﬁc’’ [4].\nA key reason for the subjectivity is the lack of quantitative\nmethods for characterizing bloodstains on fabrics.

Current methodologies, however, are qualitative and prone to\ncontext bias. In this work, we demonstrate that microscopic inspection of the stain orientations provides\na quantitative differentiation of bloodstains resulting from spatter versus contact transfer. Speciﬁcally,\ncommon knitted fabrics are comprised of parallel rows of left loop legs, in an upward diagonal orientation\n(/), and right loop legs in a downward diagonal orientation (\\). Our microscopic examination of more than\n65,000 individual stained loop legs shows that spatter stains are approximately evenly distributed\nbetween left and right loop legs, but contact transfer stains are unevenly distributed: depending on the\ntype of surface contacted, as many as 82% of the stains were preferentially located on the left loop legs. We\nfurther show that in these fabrics the left loop legs protrude further out than the right loop legs by\napproximately 50 mm, indicating that the observation of left loop legs preferentially stained over right\nloop legs is associated with the topography of the fabric. These ﬁndings suggest that microscopic\nquantiﬁcation of the relative loop leg stain distributions could provide an objective means of\ndifferentiating contact transfer versus spatter patterns in crime scene reconstruction.\n\u0002 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A\nnumberof recent studies have focused on improving knowledge and\naccuracy for areas including (but not limited to) position determi-\nnation [5], the dynamics of blood release and formation of cast-off\npatterns [11], numerical models for forward blood droplet trajectory\npredictions [12] and back spatter from gunshots [13].\nA common legal argument exists as to whether the blood-\nstaining located on a defendant [4] puts them in close proximity to\nthe victim at the time of the assault. Several crime scene cases\nknown to the authors of this study involved the defense that the\nblood spatter stains located on the suspect’s clothing was the result\nof being some distance from the assault, not through direct\ninvolvement. This has led to the identiﬁcation of a gap in practical\nempirical studies measuring the distance that blood droplets can\ntravel as a result of a blunt impact (excluding gunshots).\nAll recorded results from published peer reviewed studies\nreporting the distances that impacted blood droplets have\ntravelled appear to have been incidental or secondary to the\naim of their research. MacDonnell and Bialousz [14] examined a\nvariety of aspects of bloodstain properties and dynamics, being the\nﬁrst to document the distance that blood travelled from origin\ncaused by medium to high velocity impact forces from a motor\ndriven device. The maximum distance travelled was stated to be\n3380 mm, but unfortunately little further empirical data was\nprovided. Sweet [15] researched the velocity measurements of\nblood droplets from a medium velocity impact source, using a steel\ncylinder, in to a pool of liquid blood. Sweet noted bloodstains\nlocated on paper 820 mm above and 430 mm away from the impact\nsite. Ristenbatt and Shaler [16] reported on the bloodstain pattern\nanalysis in a homicide case study where a victim was beaten about\nthe upper body. This article reported the maximum height the\nblood recorded was 2700 mm and the maximum distance travelled\nhorizontally was 1900 mm, however as a case study the variables\nsurrounding the deposition of the blood were unknown and\ninestimable. Slemko [17] in a project titled “The Effects of Droplet\nVelocity and Fabric Composition” reported that the maximum\ndistance travelled by blood droplets propelled by a high speed fan\nwas recorded to be 3500 mm which was the limit of the test. More\nrecently Attinger et al. [18] show ﬁgures with several bloodstains\nof between 1500 mm and 2000 mm from blood source to target,\nLaan et al. [5] reported creating impact spatters at a distance of\n1000 mm and Kabaliuk et al. [12] reported a ﬂight range of about\n1530 mm.\nThe current practical study aims to investigate the mean and\nmaximum horizontal distances that blood droplets travel follow-\ning a vertical impact into liquid blood, under controlled conditions.\nUtilising a custom designed impact device, the effect of kinetic\nenergy was explored at three different heights to replicate an\nimpact inﬂicted to a person positioned lying on the ground, sitting/\nkneeling or when standing. The casework relevancy of these\nresults would assist in determining the maximum horizontal range\nthat a blood droplet could travel from an impact spatter event,\nallowing an assessment of the likelihood of an individual’s\nproximity to the event. The experimental design was intended\nto replicate a range of situations and variables commonly\nencountered in casework, based on practical constraints and the\nneed to control particular factors. This study was designed to\nachieve experimental results useful to casework, rather than to test\nor generate to theoretical or numerical models.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Device design\nAn apparatus was designed and built to create a range of\ncontrolled strikes to impact liquid blood pools using a length\n(1000 \u0001 90 \u0001 45 mm) of F17 hardwood timber (Fig. 1) rotating\nabout an axle at one end. A timber frame was built around the base\nof a sheet of form ply board (1200 \u0001 600 \u0001 20 mm) using pine\ntimber (90 \u0001 45 mm). A metal bracket and several metal corner\njoiners supported a length of pine timber placed centrally and\nvertically at the end of one of the form ply boards. A quarter circle\nshaped piece of marine ply was placed on the opposite side of the\nmetal bracket with two pieces of pine secured on the upper sides of\nthe form ply to support the threaded metal rod which was inserted\nthrough the hardwood timber “weapon”.\nA length of F17 hardwood timber was used as the “weapon”\narm. This timber was speciﬁcally selected to have an even ﬂat edge,\nhigh strength and high density value. A piece of hard, ﬂat marine\nplywood, with a varnished upper surface, was placed on the base of\nthe form ply board where the distal end of the F17 timber striking\narm was to impact. A hole was drilled horizontally through the\nproximal end of the F17 timber (Fig. 2) through which a threaded\nmetal rod was inserted (at the rotating point) providing a perfectly\nlevel join when the F17 timber arm came together with the impact\nstriking surface. Bearing ﬂanges and bearing washers were utilised\nto allow for a smoother movement of the arm with less friction.\nA metal spring (Century brand\n5\n8\u0001 61\n2 in. extension) was\nconnected to the F17 timber arm via a counter sunk metal eye hook\n(Fig. 2), and attached to another threaded metal rod running\nbeneath the ply form board through a hole cut in the form ply\nboard (Fig. 3). The placement of the spring ensured that at rest, the\nspring was in the neutral position (i.e. no tension applied).\nThe base and legs of the device were made from a second sheet\nof framed form ply, with the same dimensions as the top. Three\nlengths of pine timber (200 mm, 1000 mm and 1800 mm) were\nused as supports to the impacting device (on the upper form ply\nboard) at three different impact surface heights (Fig. 4). Two 20 kg\nbags of sand were placed in the base of the apparatus to maintain\nstability and prevent movement of the device upon impact.\nIncremental slots with shaft bearing ﬂanges were positioned on\nthe semi-circular bracket at various positions to control the\nstarting angle of the F17 timber arm. The F17 timber arm was held\nin place by the stainless steel rod being inserted through the\nbearing ﬂanges. The rod was removed by quickly pulling the\nattached rope releasing the arm and allowing it to travel in a\ndownward arc to impact level with the plywood strike surface\n(Fig. 5).\n2.2.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

It was the aim of this research to\ndetermine the potential maximum distance blood droplets travel horizontally following a vertical impact\ninto liquid blood. A custom apparatus was designed and constructed to replicate a vertical impact of a\ntimber weapon, rotating on a ﬁxed axis at one end, striking a pool of liquid blood. The device was\npositioned at three different levels of elevation to replicate an impact to the head of a person near ground\nlevel, a seated or kneeling height and standing height. Overall, the results indicated that the application of\nkinetic energy of between 1 and 5 J at a height of 1780 mm led to the blood droplets travelling a maximum\nhorizontal distance of 5361 mm (and average maximum distance of 4981 mm). The horizontal distance\nblood droplets may travel upon impact does not appear to follow a linear trend with differing kinetic\nenergy, but is affected by the applied force and release height in a curvilinear relationship.

Bloodstains can\nassist us in indicating who was involved in an assault via DNA\nproﬁling, however bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) may assist in\ndetermining where and how the blood shedding event occurred.\nWith a high proportion of physical assaults that result in death\ncoming from blunt force injuries [1], the physical characteristics of\nbloodstains can be powerful evidence. Bevel and Gardner [2] state\nthat “bloodstain pattern analysis is based on a very simple theory:\nblood as a ﬂuid will react to external forces in a predictable fashion”.\nThis theory sets the premise for BPA, in that the patterns are\nreproducible under similar physical conditions [3] and as such the\nphysical characteristics of the bloodstain patterns can reﬂect the\nnature of events that produced them.\nThe analysis of the size, shape, location, and distribution of\nbloodstains can assist with information on how they were\ndeposited [4] and BPA often plays a role in supporting or refuting\nstatements of the victim, suspect or witness [3]. For example,\ndetermining the volume and impact velocity of small bloodstains\nmay assist determining the position of where they originated [5],\npotentially providing information about whether the blood\nstaining on a suspect’s clothing could have been deposited as a\nresult of rendering ﬁrst aid [6] or being a bystander. In recent times\nthe reliability of BPA methodology has been heavily scrutinised by\nthe courts and the scientiﬁc community. The National Research\nCouncil report in 2009 [7] included the suggestion that an\nunderstanding of the physics of ﬂuid transfer was required for\nbloodstain pattern interpretation and reconstruction and that the\n“uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are\nenormous”. The fundamentals of ﬂuid dynamics relating to BPA\nhave been explored and certain aspects identiﬁed as requiring\nfurther work to increase the understanding in this ﬁeld have been\nidentiﬁed [8,9]. Subsequently, there has been a signiﬁcant increase\nin BPA research to explore the accuracy and reliability including a\ncomparative review of ﬂuid dynamics and BPA [8] that highlight\nthe links between them.\nHistorically much of the research in BPA has focused on\ndetermining the area of origin, deﬁned as “the space in three\ndimensions to which the trajectories of spatter can be utilized to\n* Corresponding author at: Ofﬁce of the Chief Forensic Scientist, Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department, Macleod, Victoria 3085, Australia.\nE-mail address: christopher.ﬂight@police.vic.gov.au (C.

To extract the maximum information from spatter\nstains, the size, velocity and direction of the drop that produces each stain, and forces acting during ﬂight,\nmust be known.\nA numerical scheme for accurate modeling of blood drop ﬂight, in typical crime scene conditions,\nincluding droplet oscillation, deformation and in-ﬂight disintegration, was developed and validated\nagainst analytical and experimental data including passive blood drop oscillations, deformation at\nterminal velocity, cast-off and impact drop deformation and breakup features. 4th order Runge–Kutta\ntimestepping was used with the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model and Pilch and Erdman’s (1987)\nexpression for breakup time. Experimental data for terminal velocities, oscillations, and deformation\nwas obtained via digital high-speed imaging. A single model was found to describe drop behavior\naccurately in passive, cast off and impact scenarios.\nTerminal velocities of typical passive drops falling up to 8 m, distances and times required to reach\nthem were predicted within 5%. Initial oscillations of passive blood drops with diameters of\n1 mm < d < 6 mm falling up to 1.5 m were studied. Predictions of oscillating passive drop aspect ratio\nwere within 1.6% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, the velocity of the drop within the\nﬁrst 1.5 m of fall is affected little by drag, oscillation or deformation.\nBlood drops with diameter 0.4–4 mm and velocity 1–15 m/s cast-off from a rotating disk showed low\ndeformation levels (Weber number < 3). Drops formed by blunt impact 0.1–2 mm in diameter at\nvelocities of 14–25 m/s were highly deformed (aspect ratios down to 0.4) and the larger impact blood\ndrops (\u00021–1.5 mm in diameter) broke up at critical Weber numbers of 12–14. Most break-ups occurred\nwithin 10–20 cm of the impact point. The model predicted deformation levels of cast-off and impact\nblood drops within 5% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, few cast-off drops will break\nup in ﬂight. However some impact-generated drops were seen to break up, some by the vibration, others\nby bag breakup.\nThe validated model can be used to gain deep understanding of the processes leading to spatter stains,\nand can be used to answer questions about proposed scenarios, e.g. how far blood drops may travel, or\nhow stain patterns are affected by winds and draughts.\n\u0002 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion).

They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Despite being similar in basic structure and\nserving equally important physiological functions in all\nmammals, red blood cells differ vastly in their rheological\nproperties in different species. Comparative studies are\ndesigned to give relevant information on the structural and\nfunctional basis of red blood cell rheological behaviour\nitself. Information gathered in comparative studies can\nthus serve as a basis for experimental models investigating\nflow phenomena in different animal species.\nBlood viscosity contributes to endothelial shear stress\n(Barakat, 2001). Shear stress modulates the orientation of\nendothelial cells in the direction of flow and to the\n‘waviness’ of the luminal surface of the vessel (Davies,\n1995). In addition, shear stress influences the arterial\ndiameter (Johnson et al. 1981) through the release of\nendothelial vasoactive factors such as nitric oxide,\nendothelin-1 and prostaglandin I2 (Frangos et al. 1985;\nMoncada et al. 1991; Malek & Izumo, 1992) and affects\narterial remodelling (Langille & O’Donnel, 1986; Sumpio\net al. 1990). However, endothelial shear stress, which is\ninfluenced by fluid viscosity and blood flow, might not be\nuniform between the animal species. In diseases with\nelevated levels of whole blood and plasma viscosity (Linke,\n1996), endothelial shear stress will be even further altered.\nThe available data are so far only of limited use. This is\npartly due to the small number of animals and species\nWhole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and erythrocyte\naggregation in nine mammalian species: reference values and\ncomparison of data\nU.

We used 40 individual adult animals of nine\nmammalian species: horse, pig, dog, cat, rat, cattle, sheep, rabbit and mouse. WBV measurements were carried\nout using a LS30 viscometer, PV was measured using OCR-D and EA was measured using a Myrenne\naggregometer and the LS30 (aggregation index at low shear rate). At low shear rates (0.7 s_1 and 2.4 s_1)\nhaematocrit (Hct)-standardized (40% Hct) samples showed a higher value of WBV and EA in horse, pig, dog\nand cat. In cattle, sheep, rabbit and mouse, EA and WBV were markedly decreased and EA was almost\nundetectable, although the plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher in these animals. Rats showed the\nhighest WBV at low shear rate in native blood and WBV was not different from horse in Hct-standardized\nblood; however, EA was very low in the rat, a result that might be explained by mechanical or geometrical\nproperties of the red blood cell. EA correlated with the plasma protein concentration in each species except dog\nand mouse. In horse, cattle and pig, EA correlated with the plasma fibrinogen concentration. At high shear rate\n(94 s_1), WBV was higher in cattle than cat and rat, and dog had higher values than horse, suggesting specific\ninterspecies differences depending on low shear and high shear values of WBV, as a result of mechanisms that\ninfluence RBC flexibility. PV was highest in cattle and lowest in rabbit and mouse and did not correlate with\nWBV. Haemorheological parameters differed between the species. Each species has its own rheological\nfingerprint. The physiological significance of these variations among mammalian species has not yet been\nestablished. Viscosity contributes to endothelial cell shear stress. While haemorheological parameters differ\nacross the species it may be postulated that factors influencing flow-mediated endothelial cell signal\ntransduction are different among the species.

Case 2\nBased on the analysed well-shaped bloodstains, the groups of\ncentres of origin were determined on two additional locations in\nthe apartment, in the kitchen and in the dinette above a chair.\nGroup 1 in the kitchen consisted of three centres, marked with\ndark and light blue colour (Fig. 9). The centres were sited in the\nmiddle of the kitchen at a height of between 160 and 173 cm, the\ndark-blue centres were closer to the fridge and slightly higher than\nthe light blue centre.\nGroup 2 in the dinette consisted of one centre (green colour),\nwhich was sited 77 cm above the seat of a chair next to the wall\n(Fig. 10). This indicated that the victim sat on the chair whilst being\nbeaten. In fact, because of the low number of blood spatters, and\ntheir small size, it was presumed that the victim suffered a blow to\nthe head at an early stage of the attack.\n4. Discussion\nThe approximate areas of origin are mainly used to deduce\nwhether the victim was standing, sitting or lying down when the\nbloodstain pattern was created. In this case, the height of the blood\nsource locations is of great importance. Using only the classical\nstringing method, in cases of longer distance between the blood\nsource location and the bloodstain, a difference in the vertical\ncomponent between the spatial direction of impact and the\nexpected centre of origin arises because of the curved trajectory of\nthe drop. A principal task of ballistic analysis of the bloodstain\npattern in these cases is to conﬁrm if these bloodstains are also\nfrom the determined blood source locations. Therefore, the\nballistic determination of the curvature of the ﬂight paths of the\nblood drops is of great importance.\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6. In the aerial view of the scene, different coloured spheres represent the\nconvergence areas of the calculated impact directions of the blood spatters (case 1).\nThese areas of trajectory intersections are the centres of origin of corresponding\nbloodstains. Two groups of centres of origin were determined based on up to 150\nanalysed blood spatters. Both groups were sited above the pillow. The group 1 was\nsited between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress, approximately in the middle of the\npillow. This group consisted of three centres, marked by green, yellow and blue\ncolours. The green and yellow centres were very close together, the blue one was\nslightly higher and closer to the wall. The group 2 consisted of two centres, marked\nin red and sea-green colour, which were sited between 25 and 35 cm above the\nmattress on the right-side of the bed, closer to the wall than the group 1.\n[(Fig._7)TD$FIG]\nFig. 7. All analysed bloodstains were located at four or possibly ﬁve centres of origin\n(case 1). The 3D model shows the ballistic determined trajectories and the centres\nof origin.\n[(Fig._8)TD$FIG]\nFig. 8. On account of the overlapping bloodstains (yellow arrows) the group 1 of the centres of origin in the middle of the pillow appeared before the group 2 on the right-side\nof the pillow appeared (case 1).\nU.

Traditional methods of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) rely significantly on the \nexpertise of professional examiners, which can result in limitations including low identification efficiency, high \nmisjudgment rates, and susceptibility to external disturbances. To enhance the accuracy and scientific rigor of \nidentifying impact spatters and fly spots, this study employed artificial intelligence techniques in image recog­\nnition and transfer learning. Two types of bloodstains obtained from simulation experiments were utilized as \ndatasets, and a pre-trained neural network, ResNet-18, was employed for feature extraction. The original fully \nconnected layer was replaced, and a new fully connected layer with a dimensionality of 2 was introduced to fulfil \nthe task requirements. The results demonstrate that the transfer learning network model, based on ResNet-18, \nachieved a maximum accuracy of 93 % in morphologically identifying impact spatters and fly spots. The \nobjective is to assist crime scene investigators and BPA analysts to identify bloodstains at homicide scenes \nconveniently, rapidly and accurately, thereby furnishing scientific evidence for scene reconstruction and \nadvancing BPA toward intelligent practices.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) employs a multi-disciplinary \napproach to discern the nature of activities and mechanisms behind \nbloodstains. BPA draws upon principles from biology, physics, and \nmathematics to scrutinise and analyze the size, shape, and distribution \nof bloodstains [1]. This approach has been demonstrated to be an \neffective tool in the investigation of crime scenes, offering vital clues and \nrobust support for crime scene reconstruction and aiding in case \ndetection during legal proceedings.\nSpatter stains are among the most common types of bloodstains \nfound at violent crime scenes [2]. These stains frequently form at the \nprimary crime scene and include subtypes such as spurt, cast-off, and \nimpact spatter [2]. Impact spatter is a type of bloodstain pattern formed \nby the impact of objects moving at different speeds on blood-stained or \nblood-containing objects, resulting in blood droplets splattering radially \nin all directions, which is of great significance for bloodstain analysts to \nanalyze the specific process of the occurrence of the case [3]. These \nbloodstains are typically circular or elliptical in shape, and their diam­\neter size is inversely proportional to the force of impact, ranging from \n0.01 mm to over 4 mm in diameter [1,3].\nIn certain homicide scenarios, when an assailant repeatedly strikes \nthe victim’s head with a blunt object near a wall, blood droplets may \nsplatter perpendicularly onto the wall, creating overlapping impact \nspatters [2]. The morphology of these overlapping impact spatters, \nresulting from multiple impacts, closely resembles the fly spots formed \nby necrophagous flies regurgitating or defecating onto wall surfaces \nafter licking blood [1,2,4]. On the one hand, fly spots typically have a \ndiameter of 1–2 mm, and exhibit a wide variety of shapes including \ncircular, elliptical, tadpole-like, and teardrop-like shapes [4–6]. These \nstains may occasionally possess a tail ranging from a few millimeters to \nless than 20 millimeters in length [4,5]. On the other hand, fly spots may \ninclude human blood that has not been fully digested, making it difficult \nfor presumptive blood tests such as Hemastix, Sangur, or Luminol, and \nDNA typing to differentiate between fly spots and impact spatter [4]. \nFailure to promptly distinguish between these bloodstain types at a \n* Correspondence to: Criminal Investigation School, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, 301 Baosheng Avenue, Chongqing 401120, China.\nE-mail address: forensicluzhou@hotmail.com (Z.

    "text_chunk": "Aspect ratios of the representative oscillating drops were\nplotted in Fig. 7 for the initial stages of ﬂight where drop\ndeformation by aerodynamic forces is less prominent due to low\nWeber numbers (We << 1). \nThe drops oscillated \naround a\nspherical shape (AR \u0006 1) with viscous damping reducing the\namplitude and the shape tending to spherical over time.\nThe mean error in drop aspect ratio determination from ellipse-\nﬁtting was less than 1%. It should be noted that the ﬁtting error for\nthe ﬁrst ten frames of the strongly deformed satellite droplet\nreached 3%, but reduced for the following images. The uncertainty\nin drop location determination from the high-speed images was\n\n1 mm.\nThe primary drops experienced moderate- to small-amplitude\noscillations with the dimensionless drop distortion y < 0.4 and\nj1 \u0004 ARj \u0007 0.3. The satellite drops oscillated with higher ampli-\ntudes (y \u0007 0.8 and j1 \u0004 ARj \u0007 0.9).\nA comparison of the measured period and frequency of drop\noscillations with theoretical predictions by ([43]; cf. [44]) for\nsmall-amplitude oscillations of a low-viscosity liquid drop in air is\nprovided in Fig. 8. The oscillation frequency and decay time for the\nfundamental harmonic are v ¼ fð64s=rd3\noÞ \u0004 ð20m=rd2\noÞ\n2g\n1=2\nand\ntD ¼ ðrd2\no=20mÞ. Surface tension increases drop oscillation fre-\nquency as s1/2. The effect of an increase in drop density is mainly\ndue to an increase the oscillation decay time and to a decrease in\noscillation frequency proportionally to r\u00041/2. The drop viscosity m\ndecreases the natural oscillation frequency and damps the\noscillations. As blood is a non-Newtonian ﬂuid its viscosity\ndepends on the shear rate of the ﬂow. To deﬁne the apparent\nviscosity of an oscillating blood drop in an air ﬂow, the ﬂow pattern\nand shear rates within the drop must be determined. The latter is a\ncomplex problem and was out of scope of this study.\nLarger drops studied were observed to oscillate with lower\nfrequencies and thus had longer periods. The frequency and period\nof oscillation of the largest drop studied (5.83 mm in diameter,\nfrom the cylinder) was about 134.7 \n 0.4 Hz and 47 \n 3 ms\nrespectively, whereas the needle drops (half as large) had an\noscillation frequency three times higher of 435 \n 1 Hz and a shorter\noscillation period of 14 \n 2 ms. Empirical and theoretical oscillation\nfrequencies (and periods) were in good agreement. This is in\nconcordance with the ﬁndings of [45] that the asymptotic behavior\nof small and moderate low-viscosity drop oscillations can be well\npredicted by the linear theory [44].\nThe \nshift \nin \noscillation \nfrequency \nof \nthe \nsatellite \ndrop\noscillations may be associated with the decrease in oscillation\nfrequency of the fundamental mode with increasing amplitude\n[46,47]. Indeed energy transfer between the fundamental and\nhigher modes (mode coupling) during high-amplitude oscillations\nchanges the energy balance of the fundamental mode. Another\npossible explanation is the error in drop size estimation, which is\ncritical during rapid oscillations.\nAs the velocity of a passive drop increases (We \t 1) with the\ndistance of fall, aerodynamic effects on drop deformation become\nmore pronounced. The equilibrium drop aspect ratio shifts from\nthat of a spherical drop (AR = 1) toward the values for an oblate\nspheroid (AR < 1). This was observed experimentally for the\npassive blood drops. The deformations naturally were more\npronounced for the larger drops which also showed a non-\nelliptical proﬁle with ﬂattening at the bottom surface facing the\nﬂow (Fig. 9). It should be noted that the hose drops still showed\nsome oscillations after 1.5 m of fall.\nA comparison between the experimental and numerical data on\ndrop oscillation from the moment of drop formation is presented in\nFig. 10 for the hose connector drops.\nThe analytical solution for the free drop oscillation around a\nspherical shape [48] AR ¼ ½1 þ Aoe\u0004t=tDsinðvtÞ\u0005\n\u00043 is shown in\nFig. 10. It models passive blood drop oscillation accurately up to\nthe third period. The parameter A0 = 0.08 was used to match\nexperimentally observed drop oscillation data.\nAs the Weber number of drop ﬂight exceeded 0.4 at 0.15 s of fall,\ndrop behavior deviated from that predicted by the free oscillation\ntheory. As the drop velocity increased due to the action of gravity\nthe drop started to deform under the increased aerodynamic\nloading and oscillated around an equilibrium deformed shape.\nWith further gradual rise in the aerodynamic loading the drop\nfurther deformed.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Finally, at the lowest impact\nvelocities stains from perpendicular impact have a smooth circular\nrim. The condition that marks the transition to splash features on\nthe stain may be mathematically deﬁned and is termed the splash\nthreshold [7]. This is based on empirical data which show\ncorrelation with surface roughness measurements so would not\nnecessarily transfer across to other surface characteristics that\nmight suppress splashing such as elasticity.\nThe origin of both spine and scallop features (Fig. 2) has\ngenerally assumed to be due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability in the\nﬂuid ﬂow due to the rapid deceleration of the liquid on hitting the\nlower density air around the stain [8]. This causes wave-like\nundulations around the circumference with a wavelength depen-\ndant on the deceleration, surface tension and density of the liquid.\nHence the number of scallops or spines observed will depend on\nhow many wavelengths ﬁt around the rim of a particular diameter\nof stain. Such arguments were presented [9] to show that these\nmay be predicted using:\nN ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nWeRe1=2\n48\nr\n(5)\nThe form of this equation appears to support – through the\nfactor WeRe1/2 – the much earlier empirical result [7] which\nattempted to predict whether splashing will take place for a\nparticular liquid impacting on a surface under speciﬁc conditions.\nHere the splashing threshold is given by [7]:\nWeRe1=2 > K \n(6)\nwhere K is characteristic of a particular surface and has been\nshown to correlate well with roughness. Note that strictly Ref. [7]\ngives the square of this expression (We2Re) as the threshold and\nindeed some authors have used the square root as the criterion! All\nthese are equivalent though the absolute values of K will differ in\neach case. The combination of these two Eqs. (5) and (6) appears to\nsuggest that for a particular surface there will be a minimum\nnumber of spines observable around any stain. Despite the form of\nEq. (5), it has been shown [10] that better agreement with\nexperimental data is given by:\nN ¼ 1:14We1=2\n(7)\nwhere the factor of 1.14 was empirically derived to produce the\nbest agreement with experimental results. Splash features around\nbloodstains have been shown [4] to follow Eq. (7) to some extent\nwith the factor further modiﬁed to be more or less unity. However\ndeviations from this model could not be identiﬁed as the data were\nnot presented in a linear fashion. In a subsequent publication [11]\nit was shown how measurements on stain size interpreted using\nEq. (3) could be combined with this interpretation of splash\nfeatures (Eq. (7)) to derive estimates for both the impact velocity\nand size of a blood droplet. This provides a potentially powerful\ntool in bloodstain interpretation.\nThe implication of these results is that until the impact\nconditions – principally a sufﬁciently high velocity – satisfy Eq. (6),\ntrue splash will not be observed. However, at lower impact speeds,\nscallops or a smooth edge will be the outcome. Whenever such\nfeatures are observed, their number is best predicted by Eq. (7)\n[10]. More recently [12] it has been suggested that there are two\npossible mechanisms for splash. So-called corona splash is driven\nby the impact on the air around the stain and predominates on\nsmooth surfaces. However, the dependence of this mechanism on\nair pressure throws doubt on the validity of the Rayleigh–Taylor\nmechanism which is driven by the density difference between the\nliquid and the surrounding air, in favour of the Kelvin–Helmholtz\nmechanism which depends on corresponding velocity difference.\nFig. 2.

The\ndesign of a pattern recognition system generally consists of the\nfollowing stages: deﬁning pattern classes, data collection, selecting\nthe distinguishing features (referred to as feature selection),\nspecifying classiﬁcation algorithms and estimating the classiﬁca-\ntion error [14].\nOver the years, pattern recognition systems have evolved to\nbecome valuable tools that are used to organise or retrieve vast\namounts of electronic data [15,16], develop computer-aided diagnosis\nsystems for the detection of disease [17–19] or to identify signature\ncharacteristics of ﬂuids [20]. It has become evident, that forensic\ndisciplinesaremovingawayfrommanualmethodsofanalysistowards\nmore automated computer-based methods of pattern recognition.\nExamples include the comparison of bullets [21], ﬁngerprints [22],\nfacial features [23], speech [24] and handwriting [25]. Indeed, certain\ncomponents of pattern recognition systems (e.g. pre-processing,\nfeature extraction and classiﬁcation) have beensuccessfullyemployed\nin bloodstain pattern studies [2,26–30].\nHowever, there does not yet appear to be a comprehensive\npattern recognition system designed to distinguish different types\nof bloodstain patterns based on measurable pattern properties.\nTherefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the viability\nof developing an automated pattern recognition system capable of\ndistinguishing bloodstain patterns. To develop the proposed\nsystem (see Fig. 1 for an overview), a laboratory-generated\nreference pattern dataset, consisting of two commonly encoun-\ntered bloodstain pattern types, was ﬁrst generated. This included\n30 impact spatter2 and 30 cast off3 bloodstain patterns that were\nspeciﬁcally digitised for the study. An image-processing method-\nology was then used to extract features that were representative of\ncommon \nbloodstain \npattern \nproperties \n[26]. \nFollowing \nthe\nidentiﬁcation of the optimal set of features, a classiﬁer4 was\ntrained and tested with separate groups of patterns from the\nreference pattern dataset. The performance of the classiﬁer was\nﬁnally evaluated with an independent dataset consisting of\nbloodstain patterns that were created on a range of surfaces.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

Pattern creation\nHuman blood from one donor was used immediately upon\ncollection togeneratethebloodstainpatternsused inthisstudy.Atotal\nof60bloodstainpatternsconsistingof30impactspatterand 30 cast-off\nbloodstain patterns were created. As an attempt to represent the\nvariability expected of such patterns, different methods of pattern\ncreation were utilised. For the impact spatter patterns, a modiﬁed\nmousetrap [31] was released onto a pool of 2 ml of blood.\nAlternatively, a similar pool of blood was pipetted onto a wooden\nblock, in the centre of the striking area. A hammer was then used to\nstrike that pool of blood. Cast-off bloodstain patterns were created\nby dipping various objects (ﬁnger, hammer and knife) in blood, and\nswinging them in either an upwards or downwards direction. In\nboth sets of experiments, blood was deposited onto plain white ﬂat\nwalls that were made of Trespa (ﬂat panel based on thermosetting\nresins; Jongeneel, Den Haag, The Netherlands). All bloodstain\npatterns were left to dry for 2 hours prior to photography. A separate\ncollection of bloodstain patterns was also sourced (Table 1). These\npatterns were termed the independent dataset and consisted of 22\nimpact spatterand 20 cast-off bloodstainpatterns that were created\non either a paint or wallpaper surface. The methods used to create\nthese patterns are reported in Laber et. al. [32].\n2.1.2. Digitisation and stitching\nA customised setup was built to enable the acquisition of high\nresolution digital images of all bloodstain patterns that were\nproduced in this study (Fig. 2). This setup consisted of a height-\nadjustable tripod which was secured to a sliding platform. The\nplatform was positioned perpendicular to the Trespa wall at a\ndistance of 210 cm and was able to slide horizontally across the ﬂoor\nat measurable distances. With this setup, a large bloodstain pattern\n(200 \u0001 100 cm with adhesive scale rulers on all four sides of the\npattern) could be captured in the form of four RAW images with 40%\noverlap.

Numerically, the exponent of the power\nlaw in Eq. (15) is about ﬁve. Also, the assumption of Dz is inversely\nproportional to the square of the velocity, which indicates that\nselecting stains generated from faster drops might decrease\nreconstruction uncertainty. Note that in both spatter patterns\nreconstructed in the above ﬁgures, some stains pointing down-\nwards are considered, while these are typically excluded from\nheight reconstruction using traditional reconstruction methods.\nBesides the uncertainty on the determination of the region of\norigin, we can also determine its error. The error in the\ndetermination of the region of origin is deﬁned in the classical\nmanner [37] as the difference between the estimated and the\nknown region of origin of a spatter pattern. Here, it is calculated as\nthe smallest vector between the determined region of origin and\nthe known region of origin. Fig. 7 plots the absolute values of the\nhorizontal (dx) and vertical (dz) components of this error,\nassuming a probability P = 99%, as a function of the horizontal\ndistance between blood source and wall. Typically, dx is negative\n(the source is found closer to the wall), and dz is positive (the\nsource is found higher than it actual location). The error of the\npresent method, at least with the eight spatter patterns studied, is\nalways smaller than 10 cm, and does not grow with the distance\nfrom the wall. Although typically negligible in a crime scene, and\nindependent of the distance from the wall, the error is not always\nzero. This means that with the present method, the known region\nof origin is not always within the determined region of origin.\nPossible reasons for this are: the assumption that ellipticity exactly\ndetermines the impact angle (Eq. (3)), no matter the stain size or\nimpact energy; the equations of motion (Eq. (1)) that neglects\ninteractions between drops; the drag coefﬁcient that neglects\noscillations of drops, while considering their steady deformation;\nand the fact that atomization occurs over a volume rather than a\nspeciﬁc point. From the eight spatter patterns examined, it appears\nthat the present method does not exhibit a systematic bias or error.\nA comparison is made with a systematic study [38] on the sources\nof error in reconstruction using straight trajectories. Since no peer-\nreviewed results could be found for spatter patterns more than one\nmeter away from the wall, additional reconstruction results\nassuming straight trajectories obtained by participants to a\nworkshop given by the ﬁrst author are also plotted in green.\nThe data points obtained while assuming straight trajectories (in\nyellow and green) are averaged from several trials. In comparison,\nthe method of strings shows a systematic error in the determina-\ntion of the height: the determined height is higher than the known\nheight. This bias is well known by BPA researchers and practi-\ntioners [6,39]. Another contribution of the present method is to\nestimate the uncertainty associated with the reconstruction of a\nspeciﬁc spatter pattern.\nShould the above method be used on a crime scene, two\nrecommendations for crime scene documentation should be\nstated. Since the method relies on inspection of the stain\nboundaries, it is important to photograph stains with the highest\npossible resolution. In this study, a resolution of 600 dots per inch\nwas used. Using a macro-lens and a state-of-the-art digital camera,\nresolutions of the same order can been reached by stitching [40]\nmultiple images of small areas (O(10 cm \n 10 cm)). Protocols for\nreliable stitching and for quality illumination in the macro-\nphotography process – where the camera objective is close to the\nobject – would have to be designed. Also, the transitions between\nstain shapes depend on the blood and target material on which\nstains are found, which has implications in documentation and\npreservation of evidence. Until reliable calibration data is provided,\nwe recommend that investigators collect samples of the target\nsurface of interest and hematocrit measurements. Note also that in\na real crime scene, it is not uncommon that the blood source moves\nduring the generation of the blood spatter. That fact will add\nadditional uncertainty in the determination of the region of origin.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this study, we propose a novel method based on sound ﬂuid\ndynamics and a probabilistic approach to determine the region of\norigin of the impact blood spatter patterns associated with\nFig. 6.

Numerous\nproposals have recently been put forth, some of which could be correct. The main focus is\nnow on the levitation of the tip of the lamella as it travels along the substrate (Latka et al.\n2012, Stevens et al. 2014, Riboux & Gordillo 2014, Liu et al. 2015). Improved imaging\nshould pinpoint the most promising explanations for the different impact conditions to\nshow whether a single uniﬁed splashing theory exists.\n2. One uncertainty in this regard is the fuzzy deﬁnition of the splashing boundary, especially\nin the presence of surface roughness. Random roughness will inherently give random\nresults, making it nontrivial to determine the splashing limit (e.g., see the large overlap\nof the splashing and deposition regimes observed in Roisman et al. 2015). High-speed\nmicrosplashing may also have been overlooked by early researchers (Thoroddsen et al.\n2012). Furthermore, drops larger than the capillary length are easily deformed from the\nspherical shape, and air drag in free fall can ﬂatten them. This invariable affects impact\noutcomes (Thoroddsen et al. 2005, Mishra et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2013) but was not\ncharacterized in many earlier studies.\n3.

One\nreconstruction question is whether the blood has been spattered via gunshot or blunt impact such as beating or stabbing. This paper proposes\nan automated framework to classify bloodstain spatter patterns generated under controlled conditions into either gunshot or blunt impact classes.\nClassification is performed using machine learning. The study is performed with 94 blood spatter patterns which are available as public data\nsets, designs a set of features with possible relevance to classification, and uses the random forests method to rank the most useful features and\nperform classification. The study shows that classification accuracy decreases with the increasing distance between the target surface collecting\nthe stains and the blood source. Based on the data set used in this study, the model achieves 99% accuracy in classifying spatter patterns at dis-\ntances of 30 cm, 93% accuracy at distances of 60 cm, and 86% accuracy at distances of 120 cm. Results with 10 additional backspatter pat-\nterns also show that the presence of muzzle gases can reduce classification accuracy.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, classification, impact spatters, gunshot spatters, spatter pattern, machine learning,\nimage analysis, random forests, feature engineering\nSee Comment here\nSee Authors’ Response here\nA bloodstain pattern is an ensemble of bloodstains. Stains are\nmarks that can be observed on a solid surface called a target. A\nblood spatter pattern is produced by drops from a blood source\nwhich have traveled through the air before reaching a target surface,\nsuch as a wall or the cardstock used in this study. Bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) has been used in US criminal courts since the sec-\nond half of last century (1–3). BPA interprets the bloodstain patterns\nin a crime scene in order to provide evidence to support the crime\nscene reconstruction (3,4). Typically, BPA uses principles of phy-\nsics, statistics, biology, and mathematics. Example reconstruction\nquestions are as follows: “What is the mechanism causing the\nbloodstain patterns? Where is the origin of the blood source?”\nRegarding the latter question, established methods based on\nthe assumption of straight trajectories are widely used to predict\nthe region of origin of a blood spatter pattern (5,6). Reference\n(7) proposed a method to improve the determination of the blood\nsource location, and Varney et al. (8) introduced a plot-based\nmethod to locate the blood source. Further, Camana et al. (9)\nused a probabilistic approach to identify the horizontal projection\nof the location of the blood source.\nWhile there have been multiple academic efforts to estimate the\nlocation of the blood source, less attention has been given to deter-\nmine the mechanism causing the spatter pattern. A question of\ninterest is whether the spatter patterns were caused by a bullet or\nblunt impact. Classifying the bloodstain patterns helps support\nother evidences such as weapons or bullet marks found on the\ncrime scene. Stain size is used in Ref. (3) to classify spatter pat-\nterns between high-velocity spatter patterns, usually generated\nfrom gunshot, and medium-velocity blood spatter patterns, that is,\ngenerated from blunt impacts of club, axe, hammer, fist, and brick.\nThey observed in their experiment that “many” stains in a med-\nium-velocity spatter pattern exhibit 1/8 inch diameter or smaller,\nwhile “essentially all” stains in a high-velocity spatter pattern have\ndiameters smaller than 1/8 inch. James et al. (10) presents the tra-\nditional method of distinguishing medium- and high-velocity\nimpact spatter patterns based on a hypothetical correlation between\nthe velocity of the generation mechanism and the size of resulting\nbloodstains. They stated that “medium-velocity impact spatters\n(MVIS) are bloodstains created when the source of blood is sub-\njected to a force with a velocity in the range of 5 to 25 ft/sec. The\ndiameters of the resulting stains are in the size range of 1 to 3 mm,\nalthough smaller and larger stains may be present. Stains in this\ncategory were usually associated with beatings and stabbings.” On\nthe other hand, “High velocity impact spatters (HVIS) are blood-\nstains created when the source of blood is subjected to a force with\nvelocity of greater than 100 ft/sec. The diameters of the spatters\nare predominately less than 1 mm, although smaller and larger\nstains are often observed....”\nThere is currently no widely accepted method to discriminate\nbetween\ngunshot\nand\nimpact\npatterns,\nand\nthe\nforensic\n1Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Atanasoff Hall,\n2434 Osborn Dr, Ames, 50011, IA.\n2Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, 2025\nBlack Engineering, Ames, 50011, IA.\n3Department of Statistics, Iowa State University, 2438 Osborn Dr, Ames,\n50011, IA.\nCorresponding author: Yu Liu, Ph.D. E-mail: liuyu0jlu@gmail.com\n[Correction added 16 January 2020.

In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

This study \naimed to investigate the effects of washing temperature, fabric type, fabric color, and stain age (time from \nstaining to laundering) on the detection and identification of bloodstains on fabrics after washing. \nMaterial and method: A total of 240 fabrics (4 different colors and 5 different types) were stained with blood and \nwashed in 4 different washing temperatures with 3 different lag times. The evaluations of fabric images were \nperformed using the FLS system (Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems®) on a total of \n1200 images using 5 different wavelengths and filter options. The bloodstained areas of the fabric pieces were \nthen excised, and the hemoglobin presence was analyzed using the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test. \nResults: The analyses of laundered samples using the FLS system revealed that the best images were obtained \nfrom velvet, cotton fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics, in that order. Except for polyester fabrics, the SERATEC® \nHemDirect hemoglobin screening test, which was used to detect bloodstains on fabrics, showed positive results \nafter washing at low temperatures (approximately 15 ◦C and 30 ◦C). At higher temperatures (60 ◦C and 90 ◦C), \nthe SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test yielded negative results. \nConclusion: The fabric type and color played a crucial role in stain detection using the FLS system on the \nlaundered fabrics. The FLS system and the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test revealed that stain age had a \nlimited effect on the stain’s detectability.   \n1. Introduction \nDetection of biological stains at the crime scene and DNA extraction \nfrom these samples are critical steps in identifying the offender or victim \nof the incident. Bloodstains are among the most common stains found at \ncrime scenes and have a significant forensic value in terms of criminal \njustice.1–3 Bloodstains can often be found on different fabrics, such as \nclothes, sheets, or blankets, belonging to individuals involved in a \nforensic case. The characteristics of fabrics, including thickness, \nweaving pattern, content, and color, affect the formation of blood­\nstains.4 These factors may influence the visibility and detectability of \nbloodstains at the crime scene. \nEven when blood is visible at the crime scene, the visibility of \nbloodstains may need enhancement if it is present in less quantity, not \nclearly visible on the surface, or has been dragged by objects, such as \nshoes.5 In addition, bloodstained clothing or items may be destroyed or \nwashed after a while to hide the crime.1 \nAlthough there are numerous methods for detecting bloodstains, \nespecially in cases where samples are scarce, important evidence such as \nDNA may be compromised by DNA degradation due to destruction of the \nbloodstained samples.5–7 The most commonly observed body fluid at a \ncrime scene is blood.7 Many crimes, ranging from murder to assault, \ninvolve blood.8 Bloodstains can absorb light at wavelength 415 nm.9 The \nForenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems (FLS) \nsystem readily allows visualization of the location of the stains and \ndocumentation as scientific evidence, which can be then presented to \nthe court.10 The FLS system is a nondestructive and noninvasive method \nbased on the absorptive and photoluminescent properties of the bio­\nlogical stains.10,11 As it permits rapid scanning of large surfaces at the \ncrime scene, using it before advanced verification methods saves time.6 \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: drdilaraoner@gmail.com (D. ¨Oner Kaya), sukriye.karadayi@altinbas.edu.tr (S¸.

Bet: \net al. / Forensic \nScience \nhernational \n76 (1995) \n47-53 \nhead is the most favoured \nsite ( - 80-90%) \nof suicidal \ngunshots \n[2,8,11], the \ncombination \nof a typical \ninjury \npattern on this topographical \nlocation \nand the \nevidence of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a \nstrong (but not unambiguous!) \nsign for suicide. \nOn the other hand, when an investigation \nof the entrance wound cannot be \nperformed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important \nto \ndiscover other morphological \nfeatures which occur typically \nafter contact shots to \nthe head supporting \n- \nbut not proving \n- \nthe diagnosis of a suicide. Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Case 2\nBased on the analysed well-shaped bloodstains, the groups of\ncentres of origin were determined on two additional locations in\nthe apartment, in the kitchen and in the dinette above a chair.\nGroup 1 in the kitchen consisted of three centres, marked with\ndark and light blue colour (Fig. 9). The centres were sited in the\nmiddle of the kitchen at a height of between 160 and 173 cm, the\ndark-blue centres were closer to the fridge and slightly higher than\nthe light blue centre.\nGroup 2 in the dinette consisted of one centre (green colour),\nwhich was sited 77 cm above the seat of a chair next to the wall\n(Fig. 10). This indicated that the victim sat on the chair whilst being\nbeaten. In fact, because of the low number of blood spatters, and\ntheir small size, it was presumed that the victim suffered a blow to\nthe head at an early stage of the attack.\n4. Discussion\nThe approximate areas of origin are mainly used to deduce\nwhether the victim was standing, sitting or lying down when the\nbloodstain pattern was created. In this case, the height of the blood\nsource locations is of great importance. Using only the classical\nstringing method, in cases of longer distance between the blood\nsource location and the bloodstain, a difference in the vertical\ncomponent between the spatial direction of impact and the\nexpected centre of origin arises because of the curved trajectory of\nthe drop. A principal task of ballistic analysis of the bloodstain\npattern in these cases is to conﬁrm if these bloodstains are also\nfrom the determined blood source locations. Therefore, the\nballistic determination of the curvature of the ﬂight paths of the\nblood drops is of great importance.\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6. In the aerial view of the scene, different coloured spheres represent the\nconvergence areas of the calculated impact directions of the blood spatters (case 1).\nThese areas of trajectory intersections are the centres of origin of corresponding\nbloodstains. Two groups of centres of origin were determined based on up to 150\nanalysed blood spatters. Both groups were sited above the pillow. The group 1 was\nsited between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress, approximately in the middle of the\npillow. This group consisted of three centres, marked by green, yellow and blue\ncolours. The green and yellow centres were very close together, the blue one was\nslightly higher and closer to the wall. The group 2 consisted of two centres, marked\nin red and sea-green colour, which were sited between 25 and 35 cm above the\nmattress on the right-side of the bed, closer to the wall than the group 1.\n[(Fig._7)TD$FIG]\nFig. 7. All analysed bloodstains were located at four or possibly ﬁve centres of origin\n(case 1). The 3D model shows the ballistic determined trajectories and the centres\nof origin.\n[(Fig._8)TD$FIG]\nFig. 8. On account of the overlapping bloodstains (yellow arrows) the group 1 of the centres of origin in the middle of the pillow appeared before the group 2 on the right-side\nof the pillow appeared (case 1).\nU.

When the stain\nsize is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the\ncorrelation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-\nsional number against a nondimensional number.\nThe circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-\nmeterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the\nstain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain\ndiameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as\nb (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape\n(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both\nthe stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4. So\nfor the two-dimensional analysis, a new parameter has been devel-\noped during this work, a, given by:\na ¼ ab\nD2\no\nð12Þ\nIn the case of a vertical impact when a spherical stain is pro-\nduced and therefore a = b this reduces to the form:\na ¼ ab\nD2\no\n¼ a2\nD2\no\n¼ b2\nð13Þ\nHence to plot results equivalent to those in Ref.

Upon detaching from the needle, the drop would\nfall onto the target surface, accelerating under the inﬂuence of\ngravity. Impact velocity adjustments U were made by changing the\nheight h at which drops were released.\nThe impact dynamics from a side perspective were captured\nwith a high-speed camera (Photron SA-5) ﬁlming at 10 000 frames\nper second. From these images, the size R and velocity U could be\ncalculated for each individual blood drop at the moment of impact.\nA second high-speed camera (Photron SA-X2) was synchronized to\ntake simultaneous images from a top-down perspective (Fig. 2).\nThe combination of vantage points allowed for a more complete\nmeasurement of the droplet shape as it impacted and spread along\nthe surface, including measurements of processes that might break\nsymmetry. Within a minute after impact, the sample was carefully\nmoved to a back-lit platform, and images were captured every\nminute for three hours with a Nikon DSLR camera (Fig. 2).\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Bloodstains on clean glass\nThe results from the experiments on the clean glass are\npresented and discussed ﬁrst, as bloodstains on these surfaces\nhave been studied in the past [9] and can provide a baseline from\nwhich to evaluate the other surfaces. Blood drops of two sizes\n(R = 1 mm and 2 mm) were released from four heights: h = 10 cm,\n20 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm. The measured impact velocity ranged\nfrom U = 1.5 m s\u00041 to 6.1 m s\u00041, consistent with gravitational\nacceleration resisted by air drag (Fig. 3a). Note that even when\nreleased from 200 cm, the drops are expected to be below their\nterminal velocity Ut when they impact the substrate. Terminal\nvelocity can be estimated by balancing the weight of the drop and\nthe drag force with the coefﬁcient of drag approximated to be 0.47\n(black lines on left-side of Fig. 3a). These terminal velocities are\nsimilar to what has been measured for rain drops [34].\nFig. 3b shows images of the blood stains that result from these\nblood drops after they impact and dry on the glass surface. Each\nbloodstain is circular with a ﬁnal size rf that depend on the initial\nsize R and release height h. More generally, the ﬁnal stain size on a\ngiven surface is considered to depend on the initial drop diameter\n2R, impact velocity U, density r, viscosity m, and surface tension g.\nThrough dimensional analysis, the parameter space can be reduced\nsuch that the spreading factor β = rf/R depends only on two\nvariables, the Reynolds number, Re \u0005 rU(2R)/m and the Weber\nnumber We \u0005 r(2R)U2/g.\nThe results in Fig. 3b are consistent with several existing\nmodels, two of which are directly compared (Fig. 3c). The ﬁrst\nexpression [15] is based on an energy balance and predicts that for\nhorizontal surfaces\nrf\nR ¼ b ¼\nWe þ 12\n3ð1 \u0004 \ncos \nuÞ þ 4We Re\u00041=2\n  \n!1=2\n; \nð1Þ\nwhere u is the equilibrium contact angle. Another expression [16]\nis written in terms of a Padé approximant, an approximation that is\nwritten in terms of a ratio of two power series. These series are\nadvantageous in that they typically converge rapidly relative to\nother standard approximations, and therefore can be more\nFig.1.

Overall, the results indicated that the application of\nkinetic energy of between 1 and 5 J at a height of 1780 mm led to the blood droplets travelling a maximum\nhorizontal distance of 5361 mm (and average maximum distance of 4981 mm).

Bloodstains can\nassist us in indicating who was involved in an assault via DNA\nproﬁling, however bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) may assist in\ndetermining where and how the blood shedding event occurred.\nWith a high proportion of physical assaults that result in death\ncoming from blunt force injuries [1], the physical characteristics of\nbloodstains can be powerful evidence. Bevel and Gardner [2] state\nthat “bloodstain pattern analysis is based on a very simple theory:\nblood as a ﬂuid will react to external forces in a predictable fashion”.\nThis theory sets the premise for BPA, in that the patterns are\nreproducible under similar physical conditions [3] and as such the\nphysical characteristics of the bloodstain patterns can reﬂect the\nnature of events that produced them.\nThe analysis of the size, shape, location, and distribution of\nbloodstains can assist with information on how they were\ndeposited [4] and BPA often plays a role in supporting or refuting\nstatements of the victim, suspect or witness [3]. For example,\ndetermining the volume and impact velocity of small bloodstains\nmay assist determining the position of where they originated [5],\npotentially providing information about whether the blood\nstaining on a suspect’s clothing could have been deposited as a\nresult of rendering ﬁrst aid [6] or being a bystander. In recent times\nthe reliability of BPA methodology has been heavily scrutinised by\nthe courts and the scientiﬁc community. The National Research\nCouncil report in 2009 [7] included the suggestion that an\nunderstanding of the physics of ﬂuid transfer was required for\nbloodstain pattern interpretation and reconstruction and that the\n“uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are\nenormous”. The fundamentals of ﬂuid dynamics relating to BPA\nhave been explored and certain aspects identiﬁed as requiring\nfurther work to increase the understanding in this ﬁeld have been\nidentiﬁed [8,9]. Subsequently, there has been a signiﬁcant increase\nin BPA research to explore the accuracy and reliability including a\ncomparative review of ﬂuid dynamics and BPA [8] that highlight\nthe links between them.\nHistorically much of the research in BPA has focused on\ndetermining the area of origin, deﬁned as “the space in three\ndimensions to which the trajectories of spatter can be utilized to\n* Corresponding author at: Ofﬁce of the Chief Forensic Scientist, Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department, Macleod, Victoria 3085, Australia.\nE-mail address: christopher.ﬂight@police.vic.gov.au (C.

To extract the maximum information from spatter\nstains, the size, velocity and direction of the drop that produces each stain, and forces acting during ﬂight,\nmust be known.\nA numerical scheme for accurate modeling of blood drop ﬂight, in typical crime scene conditions,\nincluding droplet oscillation, deformation and in-ﬂight disintegration, was developed and validated\nagainst analytical and experimental data including passive blood drop oscillations, deformation at\nterminal velocity, cast-off and impact drop deformation and breakup features. 4th order Runge–Kutta\ntimestepping was used with the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model and Pilch and Erdman’s (1987)\nexpression for breakup time. Experimental data for terminal velocities, oscillations, and deformation\nwas obtained via digital high-speed imaging. A single model was found to describe drop behavior\naccurately in passive, cast off and impact scenarios.\nTerminal velocities of typical passive drops falling up to 8 m, distances and times required to reach\nthem were predicted within 5%. Initial oscillations of passive blood drops with diameters of\n1 mm < d < 6 mm falling up to 1.5 m were studied. Predictions of oscillating passive drop aspect ratio\nwere within 1.6% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, the velocity of the drop within the\nﬁrst 1.5 m of fall is affected little by drag, oscillation or deformation.\nBlood drops with diameter 0.4–4 mm and velocity 1–15 m/s cast-off from a rotating disk showed low\ndeformation levels (Weber number < 3). Drops formed by blunt impact 0.1–2 mm in diameter at\nvelocities of 14–25 m/s were highly deformed (aspect ratios down to 0.4) and the larger impact blood\ndrops (\u00021–1.5 mm in diameter) broke up at critical Weber numbers of 12–14. Most break-ups occurred\nwithin 10–20 cm of the impact point. The model predicted deformation levels of cast-off and impact\nblood drops within 5% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, few cast-off drops will break\nup in ﬂight. However some impact-generated drops were seen to break up, some by the vibration, others\nby bag breakup.\nThe validated model can be used to gain deep understanding of the processes leading to spatter stains,\nand can be used to answer questions about proposed scenarios, e.g. how far blood drops may travel, or\nhow stain patterns are affected by winds and draughts.\n\u0002 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The time\nthat the drop resides on the substrate, deﬁned as the residence\ntime tr, is less than 15 ms (Fig. 1C).

Blood spatter patterns were created through the controlled application of pressurized air (20–80 kPa) for 0.1 msec onto sus-\npended blood droplets (2.7–3.2 mm diameter). The resulting disintegration process was captured using high-speed photography. Straight-line triangu-\nlation resulted in a 50% height overestimation, whereas using the lowest calculated height for each spatter pattern reduced this error to 8%.\nIncorporation of projectile motion resulted in a 28% height underestimation. The AO xy-coordinate was found to be very accurate with a maximum\noffset of only 4 mm, while AO size calculations were found to be two- to fivefold greater than expected. Subsequently, reverse triangulation analysis\nrevealed the rotational offset for 26% of stains could not be attributed to measurement error, suggesting that some portion of error is inherent in the\ndisintegration process.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, fluid dynamics, blood\nMeasurements taken from bloodstain spatter patterns at a crime\nscene can be utilized to calculate the associated bloodshed area of\norigin (AO) within a three-dimensional space. Generally, this\ninvolves the resolution of individual spatter patterns, selection of\nsuitable bloodstains within, resolution of impact direction, stain tri-\nangulation to yield a two-dimensional area of convergence, and\nfinally overlaying this with the third dimension, height, by calculat-\ning bloodstain impact angles via the Balthazard formula (1). Once\ndetermined, the AO can prove useful in reconstructing the events\nsurrounding bloodshed. Research examining the accuracy and\nunderlying mechanisms of this methodology is still incomplete.\nWithin the bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) community, varia-\ntion exists in methodologies used for pattern recognition, velocity\ncategorization, stain selection, and stain measurement. Despite this\nvariation, there is a strong scientific foundation for correlations\nbetween certain stain morphology parameters and the AO. These\ninclude impact directionality through the presence of one or more\nspines, triangulation using the long axis (l) of multiple stain ellip-\nses, and the angle of impact using the ratio of the long axis (l) to\nshort axis (w) through application of the Balthazard formula (Eq.\n[1]). By combining all three parameters, the final AO can be estab-\nlished within a three-dimensional space (2).\nsin h ¼ w\nl\nð1Þ\nAs projectile motion has proven difficult to incorporate into AO\nmodeling, straight-line flight paths are assumed with the inherent\nlimitation that the z-coordinate will be consistently overestimated.\nIn response, the BPA community recommends presenting the AO\nz-coordinate as a maximum height calculation (3).\nWith a few exceptions (1,4), research into BPA error rates typi-\ncally utilize a mock crime scene approach, or focus on individual\npassive droplets (5–11). Researchers employing a mock crime\nscene approach are usually attempting to replicate the conditions of\na specific criminal case. This can only provide a rough estimate of\nAO error, because the experiments are highly variable and difficult\nto control. To establish greater control, researchers have turned to\nthe study of passive droplets, which usually involves individual\nblood droplets of a standard size made to fall under the influence\nof gravity alone. However, this approach is limited to investigating\nthe error associated with the AO z-coordinate component, because\ntriangulation of multiple stains within a spatter pattern is required\nto evaluate the AO size and xy-coordinate.\nThis currently limits any complete evaluation of the AO to the\nmock crime scene approach. The consequence of which makes it\nvery difficult to explore the underlying mechanisms related to error.\nTake for example a typical experiment where some force (hand,\nbaseball bat, firearm projectile) is applied to some blood source\n(blood-soaked sponge, pool of blood). Subsequently, AO is triangu-\nlated from the resulting spatter pattern and compared with the\nknown AO. With the exception of z-coordinate overestimation\nresulting from straight-line triangulation, it would be tempting to\nconclude that any observed error must be related to the analyst’s\nmeasurement technique. This overlooks an important variable, high-\nlighted in Fig. 1. Each frame represents a 10-msec interval follow-\ning the impact of a hammer on a pool of blood. This series of\nhigh-speed photographs represents one in a series of disintegration\nevents captured by Taylor et al., available online (http://www.\nameslab.gov/mfrc/rd) (12). It is clear from these images that a num-\nber of complex fluid dynamic events are present. Therefore, it\nseems reasonable to speculate that some degree of AO error might\nbe related to blood displacement and disintegration from an often\ncomplicated and variable collision.\n1Departmental of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of\nToronto, 5 King’s College Road, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G8, Canada.\n2Centre of Forensic Sciences, 25 Grosvenor Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A\n2G8, Canada.\nReceived 18 May 2010; and in revised form 2 Sept. 2010; accepted 11\nSept. 2010.\nJ Forensic Sci, September 2011, Vol. 56, No. 5\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01835.x\nAvailable online at: onlinelibrary.wiley.com\n1136\n\u0002 2011 American Academy of Forensic Sciences"

The lateral spreading W (the minor\naxis of the elliptic stain, perpendicularly to the projection of the\nvelocity vector on the target) is driven not by the whole velocity,\nbut by the velocity component normal to the surface [14]. An\nequation similar to Eq. (8) therefore applies, where Re is deﬁned\nbased on the velocity component normal to the surface. The axial\nspreading, L, along the projection of the impact velocity onto the\ntarget plane is typically larger than W: while the velocity\ncomponent normal to the surface induces axial spreading similarly\nas the longitudinal spreading, the cylindrical path of the droplet\nintercepts the surface at an angle a, and this latter contribution\nmakes L larger than W, so that the stain is elliptical.\nExperiments show that the ratio W/L of the extension in the\nlateral direction over that in the forward direction increases\nmonotonically with an increasing impact angle [42], following a\ntrigonometric relation ﬁrst established in [122]\nW=L ¼ sina: \n(10)\nMeasuring the ellipticity of a stain therefore provides important\ninformation on the impact angle.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8).

The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &\nBourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or\nspatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Recently, several attempts have been\nmade at reconstructing ballistic trajectories backwards, considering the effects of gravity and drag forces.\nHere, we propose a method toreconstructthe regionof origin ofimpact bloodspatterpatternsthat considers\nﬂuid dynamics and statistical uncertainties. The ﬂuid dynamics relies on deﬁning for each stain a range of\nphysically possible trajectories, based on known physics of how drops deform, both in ﬂight and upon\nslanted impact. Statistical uncertainties are estimated and propagated along the calculations, and a\nprobabilistic approach is used to determine the region of origin as a volume most compatible with the\nbackward trajectories. A publicly available data set of impact spatter patterns on a vertical wall with various\nimpactor velocities and distances to target is used to test the model and evaluate its robustness, precision,\nand accuracy. Results show that the proposed method allows reconstruction of bloodletting events with\ndistances between thewall andblood source largerthan \u00011 m. The uncertaintyof themethod is determined,\nand its dependency on the distance between the blood source and the wall is characterized. Causes of error\nand uncertainty are discussed. The proposed method allows the consideration of stains indicating impact\nvelocities that point downwards, which are typically not used for determining the height of the origin. Based\non the proposed method, two practical recommendations on crime scene documentation are drawn.\n© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is one of many techniques of\nforensic science and crime scene investigation [1,2]. Besides the\ndetermination of the mechanisms causing speciﬁc collections of\nstains (patterns), BPA also aims at reconstructing blood spatter\npatterns — patterns generated by impact of airborne drops on a\ntarget surface. For spatter patterns, the determination of the 3D\nlocation of the spatter producing event \u0003 the region of origin \u0003 is\nrelevant to criminal cases. Note that the term region of origin used\nthroughout the manuscript departs from current standards [3] in\nBPA, which recommend area of origin. We ﬁnd that term confusing\nbecause of its 2D technical meaning, while the origin of a spatter is\nclearly a 3D region of space which the work in this manuscript\nidentiﬁes and measure as a volume. As translated from the 1939\nextensive and seminal BPA study of Balthazard et al., “The problem\nof reconstructing curved trajectories is very difﬁcult to solve” [4].\nIndeed, proper backward reconstruction of the trajectory of a\nsingle drop relies on the determination of the three impact velocity\ncomponents, as well as the drop volume, the latter necessary for\nthe consideration of drag forces along the trajectory.\nBackward trajectory reconstruction typically involves the\nfollowing steps: (1) the inspection of the roughness, cleanliness\nand wickability of the target surface, the surface where the stains\nare located; (2) the selection of a sufﬁcient and tractable number of\nstains out of many (sometimes more than 10,000 [5]) blood stains\nat the target surface; (3) the measurement of size, shape and\norientation of those stains; (4) the inference of impact conditions\nbased on measurements in (3); and (5) the backward reconstruc-\ntion of drop trajectories compatible with the stains and impact\nconditions; and (6) the identiﬁcation of a region of origin in 3D\nspace. Current trajectory reconstruction methods [6] are called the\nmethod of strings or the tangent method, and assume that blood\ndrops travel in straight trajectories from the area of origin to the\ntarget surface. Software based on same method and assumptions is\navailable and used in crime scenes [7,8].\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: attinger@iastate.edu (D.

The prediction from the numerical\nsimulations in Fig. 7 that A50 reaches a maximum at an\nintermediate distance between blood source and vertical target\nspatter was tested against a series of gunshot backspatter\nexperiments from Ref. [46]. As Fig. 8 shows, both experiments\nand numerical simulations show a comparable maximum for A50 at\na distance of about 75–90 cm. This agreement between experi-\nments and numerical simulations is a sign that the developed\nmodel captures the relevant ﬂuid dynamics. Moreover, it opens a\npath towards quantitative crime scene reconstruction of the\nrelative position of the blood source and the spatter based on a\nstatistical examination of the stains.\nThe A50 value for each vertical deposition distance acts as a\nborder between the small and large droplets. The geometric\ncentroids, CY, of those less than or equal to this value as compared\nto those larger than A50, can help facilitate a qualitative analysis\nperformed by BPA experts on the distance to the vertical impact\nsubstrate by comparing to the quantitative analysis below. Plotting\nthe lowest bounded centroid (from droplets > A50) and the highest\nbounded centroid (from droplets \b A50) as a function of the\nvertical deposition distance is seen in Fig. 9.\nNote that CY becomes the same and equal to approximately\n60 cm for both bullet types after a certain distance. The best ﬁt\nlines of Fig. 8 were found based off of the average of the two\ncentroids and a good ﬁt was found with a simple exponential decay\nfunction,\nCY ¼ C0 þ Fe\u0006GZ; \nð8Þ\nwhere the parameters are shown in Table 3.\n4. Conclusion\nA series of experiments were conducted by the present group\nand the resultant experimental images with the raw data\ndeposited in Ref. [46]. Four of those sets of experimental data\nwere chosen and compared with the physically based models for\nsharp [41], and blunt bullets [42]. These models predict that the\nRayleigh–Taylor \ninstability \nis \nresponsible \nfor \nblood \ndroplet\nformation in backward spatter and their initial size distribution.\nThe velocity and acceleration distribution in blood in the target are\nfound solving the corresponding ﬂuid mechanical problem, thus\nallowing for the prediction of the resulting trajectories of the\ndroplets accounting for gravity, air drag and droplet-droplet\naerodynamic interactions. The number of stains, the average stain\narea, and the average impact angle on the cardstock target\npredicted by the physical models of Refs. [41,42] were compared\nwith experimental data and revealed reasonably good agreement.\nAlso, the models were used to provide a further insight into the\nphenomena of backward spattered blood by predicting the\nlocations of the stain area corresponding to a 50% cumulative\ndistribution and the geometric centroid of the spatter pattern. It\nshould be emphasized that the proposed empirical formulae of\nEqs. (7) and (8) have not been extensively tested against a variety of\ngunshot spatter patterns. However, they have originated from the\nexperiments and predictions mentioned in this work which\nprovides an initial step on the path towards quantitative crime\nscene reconstruction.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was ﬁnancially supported by the United States\nNational Institute of Justice (award NIJ 2014-DN-BX-K036 and NIJ\n2017-DN-BX-0171).

In all experiments, the great\nmajority of spots were less, or much less, than 1 mm diameter.\nSpots were widely distributed on the overalls, but especially to the\nleft arm and chest in the nasal exhalations; they were biased to the\nhips and thighs and the right leg for the spitting exhalations; this\nprobably reﬂected differences in the primary direction of the\nexhaled stream.\nIn Series A, the bulk of the spots were on the left forearm which\nappeared to shield the remaining body regions and the left chest\ntook a reasonable density of droplet hits, the remainder of the body\nwas relatively balanced between left and right sided hits. In Series\nB, the target was moved down from more the face level to chest\nlevel and it would appear that the heaviest capture density was left\nchest to waist. The target had possibly moved more into the ﬁring\nline of the nasal exhalation, which would be expected to be more in\nthis direction than in Series A. This would also explain the\ngenerally higher total counts overall. In Series C, the mouth spit\nwould have been expected to be more directed to the target than\nwas the case for Series A with nasal exhalations. The distribution\nwas relatively balanced left to right.\nThe deposition distributions in the three series relate reason-\nably to the relative positioning and means of exhalation. The fact\nthat the nearer body parts often had the highest spot counts did not\ndiminish the explicitly recorded observation that signiﬁcant\nnumbers of spots were found on the more distant body regions\nthat were in line with the exhalation and not shielded by other\nparts, more proximal to the source.\n3.4. Use of a simpliﬁed physical nose model\nDrops of blood, placed at the distal tip of the nasal tube (Fig. 1,\nposition 1), tended to be propelled only a short distance on\nexhalation, producing only a small amount of spray. The moment\nthe exhalation was initiated, a small amount of spray was\nproduced, blood predominantly fell out of the tube to the ground\nbelow creating a few splashes several millimetres diameter.\nWhen blood was instilled approx. 1 cm behind the tip (position\n2), a different pattern of elimination was observed. The blood ﬁlm\nsurface was torn by the airﬂow and the expelled droplets\ntransported along with the exhaled air. In all cases, the vertical\ntarget surface intercepted many hundreds of very small droplets,\nproducing spots typically much less than 0.5 mm diameter, many\nbeing less than 0.1 mm dia., along with some larger spots. Some\nspots, mainly larger ones, were also detected on the horizontal\ntarget surface. When the nasal tube was inclined upwards, the\ninterception distance was observed to be greater than 1 m for\nmany droplets, both small and large.\nWhen blood was instilled further back within the cavity\n(position 3), the blood ﬁlm was again torn by the emerging airﬂow\ninto droplets of a range of sizes. However, the larger droplets\ntended to impact on the walls of the cavity upstream of the valve,\nleaving a stream of smaller droplets to emerge as before,\ngenerating a pattern of interception on the vertical target of\nalmost entirely small spots with comparatively few being observed\non the horizontal target.\n3.5. General\nWhilst the diameter of the droplets producing the individual\nspots could not be measured directly, the captured blood wetted\nthe paper surface and thus spread to cover an area larger than the\noriginating droplet; in consequence, the measured spot sizes were\ncertainly larger than the droplet diameter.\nThe typical speed of the exhaled air package varied considerably\nbetween the four studies on the basis of the estimated exhaled\nvolumes and periods. The transient maximum air speed in the\nmodel studies could have been as high as 20 m s\u00021. This may be\ncompared with an estimated speed of around 3.5 m s\u00021 in the\nstraw pufﬁng study or about 2 m s\u00021 in the upright spitting and\nprone mouth exhalations, assuming a pursed lip and teeth\nconﬁguration providing an oriﬁce of about 3 cm \u0003 0.1 cm. The\nprone nasal study, assuming an oriﬁce similar to the straws, would\ngenerate a typical exhaled air speed nearer 2 m s\u00021.\nIn a separate unpublished study, we ﬁlmed initial blood droplet\nejection speeds produced by aggressive hitting of a hand-held\nheavy metal bar on a bloody surface designed to model the human\nskull. The study design and choice of weapon were determined by\nthe wish to replicate a possible alternative scenario causing the\n[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]\nFig. 6.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

This concludes the desiccation of the drop and no\nfurther changes are observed.\nAll patterns observed with dried drops of blood present similar characteristics: the\ncentral part of the drop, the wide mobile plaques of the corona with wide white cracks,\nand the ﬁne periphery (ﬁgure 2). Whereas the central part of the drop and the ﬁne\nperiphery stick onto the glass plate due to the absence of RBCs, the corona is where\nmobile deposits form and these do not adhere to the substrate. The explanation of\nthis wetting phenomenon lies in the proteins which exist on the RBCs (glycoproteins).\nThe function of these proteins is to avoid wettability with a wall and, in particular,\nthe internal wall of organs, veins.\nAt the beginning of drop evaporation, the ﬂuid is homogeneous in colloids, this is\nwhy a thin periphery can dry on the glass plate. However, since Marangoni convection\nis occurring, the RBCs (and other heavy colloids) accumulate at the drop triple line,\nwhich is receding. The RBCs accumulate by Marangoni convection to form a solid\ndeposit which will be called hereafter ‘the corona’. The remaining ﬂuid, which consists\nmainly of serum without heavy colloids, leads to typical small-sized patterns adhering\nto the glass substrate after its evaporation.\n3.2.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁngering of an ink blot or a coffee stain is familiar to everyone. However, despite 140 years\nof study (Worthington 1876), the underlying rapid dynamics of the impact process eluded expla-\nnation until the past 20 years, when high-speed video technology began to allow time-resolved\nobservations of this intriguing phenomenon (Thoroddsen et al. 2008). The increasing pace of sen-\nsor improvements and availability is allowing the study of ever-ﬁner detail and is reinvigorating\nresearch in this area of study, as demonstrated by the large number of very recent references cited\nherein. This imaging technology is now reaching the diffraction limit of spatial resolution and sub-\nmicrosecond interframe times (Li & Thoroddsen 2015, Visser et al. 2015). This is being matched\nby increasing computational power and improved numerical algorithms to allow fully resolved\nsimulations in the axisymmetric conﬁguration (Thoraval et al. 2012), and fully three-dimensional\n(3D) cases, from ﬁrst contact, should soon follow (Agbaglah et al. 2011).\nWe strictly conﬁne our review to impacts on solid surfaces and leave out studies involving\nimpacts on pools or ﬁlms of liquid. Moreover, we emphasize recent works [i.e., appearing after\nthe earlier review by Yarin (2006) in this journal, which dealt with impacts on both solid and\nliquid surfaces].\nStudies of drop impacts are driven by several areas relevant both in nature and in industry.\nIn nature, a drop of water hollows a stone, and splashing produces aerosols, causes erosion, and\nbrings the smell of the earth during rain ( Joung & Buie 2015). In industry, there are spray/wall\ninteractions in coating, cleaning, cooling, and combustion. Inkjet droplets play an increasing role\nin fabrication, from the soldering of electronics to microarrays in biotechnology.\nFigure 1 presents some iconic images of impacting drops, including sketches by Worthington\naround the dawn of photography.

The bloodstain metrics for the 11 stains in cast-off \npattern 103 are displayed in Table 3.\n4.5. Pattern metrics\nThe pattern metric outputs for the three different patterns (impact \n14, cast-off 103 and expirated 9) are displayed in Table 4.\nFor the linearity, the centroids of the stains were plotted and a 2- \ndegree polynomial was fitted to the points (see Fig. 10). The measure \nof how well the points fitted to the curve were represented by the \ncalculated R2 value. The R2 values for both the impact and expirated \npatterns were very low indicating the centroid points did not fit well to a \ncurved line. The R2 value for the cast-off pattern was higher which is \nexpected as this pattern type is more linear than the other two which are \nradiating patterns. As not all cast-off patterns produced stains in a \nstrongly linear distribution a large range of R2 values (ranging from 0.1 \nto 0.99) were noted for these types of patterns.\nLikewise, both density measurements (ratio of the stain number to \npattern area and ratio of stain area to pattern area) is lowest for cast-off \nwhich is expected as this pattern has a smaller number of stains.

    "text_chunk": "experiments, there are some uncontrolled factors which result in\ntwo very different outcomes. Upon careful inspection of the high-\nspeed videos, it seems that the silicone-encased sponge in\nexperiment 7Db2 held more blood. Even more critically, the\nblood seems to have pooled to the backside of the target where\nbackward \nspatter \nwould \nform. \nTherefore, \nthe \npresence \nof\nbackward spatter in only one of these trials could simply be\nexplained by the undocumented blood ﬁlling process of the\nsilicone-encased sponge, or by gravity-driven transport of blood.\nRegardless of this deﬁciency, Fig. 3b still reveals the important\nresult of a faster average blood velocity for forward spattered\ndroplets versus backward spattered droplets.\nIt should be emphasized that the PIV results shown in Figs. 1–3\ndo not contain data with the initial velocities of the droplets. All\ndata points were taken starting at 0.4 ms after the bullet impacted\nthe target (except for experiment 7Db1 where data started at\n0.5 ms due to the inability to accurately resolve the droplets at an\nearlier moment of time – the early frames are completely blurry).\nThe analysis was only conducted for the time interval when the\ndroplets became clear enough to get accurate results. Droplets\nwere formed before 0.4 ms, but with the current high-speed\nvideos, PIV cannot be utilized to measure their velocity. The high-\nspeed videos seem to show at least two regimes of the expulsion of\ndroplets, the ﬁrst of which has not been measured by PIV here. The\nﬁrst regime is a very fast moving spray which occurs almost\ninstantaneously after the impact. After about 0.4 ms, the second\nregime begins to take place where the web of blood issued\nfrom the target consists of recognizable droplets moving at a\nmuch slower pace. An example of these two regimes can be seen in\nFig. 4 which is a frame taken from the high-speed video of\nexperiment 7Aa1.\nAs described in Section 2, the number of droplets was counted\nwith the particle analysis toolset of ImageJ within a region of\ninterest replicating the one used in the PIV analysis. The results for\nthe number of droplets in each experiment are shown in Fig. 5.\nFor the three experiments which contained both forward and\nbackward spattered droplets, there were always more forward\nspattered droplets. In comparing experiments 7Aa1 and 7Ab1,\nwhich differ only in the caliber of the bullet, experiment 7Ab1,\ncorresponding to the larger caliber, produced more droplets in\nboth forward and backward spatter. It also seems as if the\nexperiments with an open-faced bare sponge produce more\ndroplets overall when accounting for the experimental incon-\nsistencies of 7Db1 and 7Db2.\nUsing the particle analysis toolset of ImageJ, the side view area\nof each individual droplet can also be determined. An average of all\nthese values in each experiment is shown in Fig. 6\nFor \nthe \nexperiments \nwhich \nrevealed \nboth \nforward \nand\nbackward spattered droplets, there is an insigniﬁcant difference\nbetween the average side view area of droplets in the case of a\nbare sponge. The silicone-covered sponge in experiment of\n7Db2 resulted in much larger backward spattered droplets, albeit\nFig. 3. Droplet velocities for experiment 7Db1 shown in panel (a), and 7Db2 shown in panel (b).

The authors found correlations for experi-\nmental data for a variety of liquids against Reynolds numbers\nof up to 25,000 and Weber numbers of up to 4000 for ReI\nagainst the number of spines and the ratio of stain size to drop\nsize. This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation\nnow (mis)printed as\nReI / ðRe1=2We1=4Þ0:75\nð11Þ\nhereafter referred to as ReIM.\nHowever, the above work only considered the vertical impact of\nblood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-\nface. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the\nvertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little\nwork on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either\nonto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45\u0002\nto validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the\nflow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).\nBy looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper\nthis paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine\nthe impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for\nwhich the vertical impact is simply a special case.\nExperimental Technique\nAs in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has\nbeen shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood\nwas mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.\nBlood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood\nto be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37\u0002C and removed\nonly when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were\ncarried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in\na fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at\nthe end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),\nviscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)\nfor pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).\nThe blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at\nheights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,\nresulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-\nette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-\nferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–\n5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting\nof blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically\nto impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give\nimpact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90\u0002 to the hori-\nzontal. For the 22.7\u0002 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used\nand for the small pipette at 90\u0002 to the horizontal, extra heights of\n20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-\nard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,\nand surface slope was repeated six times.\nThe last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-\ntom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at\n1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured\nusing the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera\nsoftware version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly\nusing the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the\ndroplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that\nif inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it\nwas taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size\nwas measured and the number of spines around the entire stain\n(360\u0002) was counted by hand. For each angle and height, the results\nwere averaged over the six replicates. The stain size and number of\nspines were then plotted against a number of variables to obtain a\ncorrelation coefficient.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the effect of impact angle on the number of\nspines obtained and the stain size and shape. As shown in previous\nwork (1), as the impact angle increases, i.e., becomes closer to a\nvertical impact, the stain becomes shorter, until for a vertical\nimpact a circular stain is generated (Fig. 1a). What has not been\ndiscussed before is that the number of spines also alters as the\nimpact angle alters. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the number of\nspines increases as the impact angle increases. As the drop size or\nimpact velocity increase the stain size and number of spines also\nincreases for an angled impact, Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, as pre-\nviously demonstrated in Ref. (17) for a vertical impact.\nVertical Impact\nTo compare the results against work by previous authors, at first\nonly vertical impacts were considered with the correlation coeffi-\ncients, R2, given in Table 1 for stain size and Table 2 for number\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFIG. 1—Blood stains falling from 100 cm for a medium sized pipette at\nangles of (a) 90\u0002, (b) 78.8\u0002, (c) 61.6\u0002, (d) 43.5\u0002, and (e) 33.7\u0002 to the vertical.\nKNOCK AND DAVISON\n• POSITION OF THE SOURCE OF BLOOD STAINS\n1045\n 15564029, 2007, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00505.x by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using\nlarger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can\nobscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).\nBlood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nLaan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can\nhelp pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).\nThe splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical\nS-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in\nFigure 8.\n5. THE EFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE PROPERTIES\nAbove we focus on impacts on ﬂat dry surfaces. Allowing modiﬁcation of the substrate opens\nup uncountable variants. The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &\nBourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or\nspatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Determination of the directions and angles of impact and the centres of origin\nThe direction of impact and the vertical ﬂight path plane in the room can be\ndetermined by using the angle of impact and the directionality of the bloodstain. The\nangle of impact of the blood drop, which is formed between the direction of the blood\ndrop and the ﬂatsurfacethat is struck, is calculated basedon the relationship between\nthe length of the major and minor axes of the elliptical bloodstain. In addition, the\ndirectionality of the bloodstain is ascertained from the longitudinal axis of the ellipse\nand the direction in which the spin points (Fig. 5). In this manner, the directionality\nandlength of the major and minoraxes of the ellipseof all well-deﬁned bloodstains on\nwalls, ceilings and on furniture that has not been removed are accurately measured.\nBased on these measurements, the assumed straight line for the ﬂight path of the\nbloodstains is calculated and drawn in the 3D model of the crime scene using CAD\nsoftware. To reduce errors in determinating impact angles, only bloodstains with low\nimpact angles have been considered in the analysis [13–15].\nIn a top view of the impact directions of the bloodstains, convergence areas are\nshown in groups of straight lines in high concentration, which intersect one\nanother.\nThese\nconvergence\nareas\nare\npossible\ncentres\nof\norigin\nfor\nthe\ncorresponding bloodstains. In a side view, the height of the centres of origin is\ndetermined by ﬁnding the average intersections of only the straight lines of the\nbloodstains which occur at a short distance from the blood source location.\nThe photogrammetry software Elcovision 10 in combination with the AutoCAD\nsoftware performs an automatic calculation of all measured ellipses and draws the\ncalculated straight lines of the directions of impact of the bloodstains in the 3D\nmodel of the crime scene. Then the centres of origin are determined automatically\nby software, or manually, based on the produced 3D model.\n2.6. Ballistic determination of the trajectory of the blood spatter\nFor the determination of the blood source location, the trajectories of\nbloodstains, which are of a short distance from the blood drop origin, can be\nassumed as straight lines.\nIn cases of longer distance, a difference in the vertical component between the\nspatial direction of impact (in the vertical plane) and the expected centre of origin\narises, because of the curved trajectory of the drop. In these cases a ballistic\ndetermination of the trajectory of a blood drop is performed in order to show\nwhether these bloodstains arise from the determined centre of origin or from a\ndifferent origin.\n[(Fig._2)TD$FIG]\nFig. 2. 3D documentation of the crime scene.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

    "text_chunk": "suggesting that the results merit further investigation and\nreﬁnement of the image analysis technique.\nFurthermore, the results presented here raise several fascinat-\ning and pertinent questions. First, how does the disparity in stained\nleft versus right loop legs vary with height asymmetry? Here we\nexamined only two fabrics, so a more comprehensive survey of\nmany fabric types would be helpful to develop a quantitative\ncorrelation. Second, we performed the contact transfer as soon as\npossible after spraying the blood onto the donor surface (glass or\nleather), but if the blood is left to evaporate for some time then its\nphysical properties (e.g., viscosity and interfacial tension) will\nchange. ‘‘Drier’’ blood will likely also yield discrepancy between\nstained left and right loop legs, but quantitative corroboration is\nnecessary. Third, we performed all contact transfer in this study\nsimply by pressing the fabric onto the donor surface by hand, using\n(to the best of our ability) the same applied force each time. Given\nour proposed mechanism, a possibility worth investigating is that\nthe pressure exerted during the contact transfer could alter the\nmicroscopic distribution of stained loop legs. For example one\npossible hypothesis is that a low application of force (i.e., a ‘light\npush’) yields a higher discrepancy between left and right loop legs\nbecause the recessed legs fail to reach the drops, whereas a high\napplication of force (i.e., a ‘heavy push’) minimizes the discrepancy\nby bringing the recessed loop legs in closer contact with the drops.\nLikewise, this study restricted attention to contact transfer\nperformed by applying pressure to the fabric normally (orthogo-\nnally) to the donor surface; the effect of shearing motions (i.e.,\n‘brushing or swiping’) tangential to the donor surface remain to be\nexamined. The present study will serve as a framework to address\nthese more complicated questions, and help put bloodstain pattern\nanalysis on a more quantitative footing.\nAcknowledgments\nSupport for this research was provided by the National Institute\nof Justice (Award No. 2010-DN-BX-K039).

Overall, the stain sizes\nand shapes do not appear to substantially change during the drying\nprocess. An exception occurs on the ﬁngerprint-coated glass, as\nthere appears to be a stick-slip dynamic between the images taken\nat 30 and 60 min. Speciﬁcally, the contact line for this drop\nsuddenly retracts as the drop dries, leaving behind a faint ring of\ndried blood (Fig. 6, second row).\nThe drying dynamics on the clean glass is similar to what has\nbeen previously documented [38]. Within 10 min of being on the\nsurface, the drop changes color as it solidiﬁes and appears to form a\nthicker rim region. Within 30 min, the drop has completely dried,\nand cracks have formed along the rim. On the coated surfaces, the\ndrop takes longer to completely dry, perhaps because it is thicker,\nas indicated by the darker color when backlit (Fig. 6).\nTaken together, the short and long-time dynamics indicate\nthat \nstain \nsize \non \nthese \nmicroscopic \ncoatings \n(Fig. \n4) \nis\npredominantly set within the ﬁrst tenth of a second. The early-\ntime spreading and retraction can be quantiﬁed by measuring the\ncontact radius r over time t. Fig. 7a plots this contact radius,\nnormalized by the initial drop radius, for the drops illustrated in\nFig. 5. Note that during the spreading phase, the dynamics are\nindistinguishable and the differences in the stain size appear to\nbe related to the speed at which the extended droplet retracts. The\nﬁnal spreading factor β is also included for comparison. The\nretraction speed and timescale are consistent with a mechanism in\nwhich the contact lines recede to lower the surface energy while\nbeing resisted by the liquid inertia [39,40]. This mechanism\nindicates that the contact angle u of the coating is likely an\nimportant parameter when predicting the ﬁnal stain size. Recall\nFig. 6. Time series of the drying process for the blood drops depicted in Fig. 5. All drops were in their ﬁnal conﬁguration after 2 h. Note that the line visible in the half clean-half\nﬁngerprint binary coating is on the opposite side of the glass slide and used to identify the edge of the coating. The scalebar of 5 mm applies to all images.\nFig. 7. Plot of the contact radius r(t) and ﬁnal spreading factor β for the blood\ndrops depicted in Figs. 5 and 6 . (a) The normalized contact radius r(t)/R spreads to a\nmaximum value rmax/R ms after impact. Subsequently, the drop can recede and\neventually reaches a ﬁnal spreading factor β. (b) The ﬁnal spreading factor rf/R = β\ndepends on the measured contact angle u of the coating (closed symbols) and is\nplotted along with the prediction from current theories (Eq.

Blood\nAnticoagulants are necessary to prevent the onset of coagula-\ntion that better represents the physical properties of blood at the\ntime of the assault [3] and as such have been used in many\nbloodstain pattern research studies. There are a number of\ndifferent anticoagulants that have been used in BPA studies\nincluding ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), which has\nbeen reported as being suitable to prevent coagulation [19].\nThe physical properties of porcine blood, including hematocrit\nrange and shear viscosity of whole blood and plasma, closely\nresemble that of human blood [18–20]. Its use up to two weeks old\nhas been shown to be similar to the behaviour of freshly spilt\nhuman blood providing it had been collected directly into EDTA\nanti-coagulant bottles and incubated at 4 \u0003C for that period [21]. It\nis however recommended to use the porcine blood as soon as\npossible after its collection to limit the possibility of change within\nthe blood properties [22].\nTwo litres of fresh pig blood was sourced directly into a 2 l\nplastic container with 3.0 g of EDTA. The blood was transported\ndirectly to the laboratory in a thermally insulated case and\nplaced into a water bath maintained at \u000437 \u0003C [20]. The water\nbath was set to shake to keep the blood moving to prevent\nseparation and settling of erythrocytes [22]. Care was taken not\nto deviate from ideal circumstances by controlling the temper-\nature of the blood, reducing the time the blood was exposed to\nthe air, indoor testing to reduce air currents and using a well-\ndeﬁned quantity of blood.\n2.5.

For violent crimes\ninvolving gunshots, standard practice in police departments worldwide have some physical limitations.\nFor instance, the effect of gravity and air drag on trajectories of blood droplets are neglected using current\nreconstruction methods, which results in a well-known overestimation of the height of the source of\nblood. As a consequence, more sophisticated models for blood spatter trajectory reconstruction are being\ndeveloped, two of which are highlighted in the present work. They allow the prediction of bloodstain\npatterns produced from backward spattered blood droplets from blunt and sharp bullets. Our recent\nmodels attribute the splashing of blood to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability which arises when blood is\naccelerated towards lighter air. This physically-based description comes with the powerful predictive\ncapability to correlate features of bloodstain patterns with the speciﬁc bullet and gun that produced\nthem, as well as with the body position. The results of the numerical models were compared with four\nexperiments simulating blood spatter deposition on a vertical wall through the number of stains\nproduced, average stain area, and average impact angle at the surface, and the agreement found is fairly\ngood. Moreover, further insight is obtained by probing and explaining the inﬂuence of observable\nparameters on the resulting spatter pattern, with the goal of aiding BPA experts evaluating a crime scene.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the inspection of blood\nspatter patterns which were produced due to violent crimes [1].\nThe goal of BPA is to provide answers to questions arising from the\nscene of a violent crime such as what caused these patterns.\nDetermination of the region of origin of the blood spatter is\nexpected from the BPA community [2], however, current techni-\nques lack a fundamental basis in ﬂuid mechanics [3]. Namely, the\nmethod of strings, or the trigonometric method, which has been in\nuse since as early as the 1950s [4] and is implemented in widely\ndistributed software [5–9], neglects physical realities such as\ngravity and air drag [2]. Understandably, this results in signiﬁcant\nwell-established errors [10,11], for example, there can be a 50%\noverestimation of the height of the region of origin [12]. Moreover,\nthe widely used formula for the determination of the impact angle\nof a blood droplet, sin α = W/L [13], where W is the width of the\nstain and L is the length, has major ﬂaws since the values of sine of\nthe impact angle are practically indistinguishable between 75\u0001 and\n90\u0001. Namely, they vary from 0.97 for 75\u0001 and 1 for 90\u0001, and is the\nreason that standard BPA practice encourages stains with impact\nangles less than 60\u0001 be used for reconstruction [1].\nAdding to the difﬁculty of an accurate reconstruction model of\nblood spatter patterns is the rheological complexity of blood. Blood\nis a non-Newtonian, shear thinning [14–16] complex aqueous\nsolution containing various cells and proteins in plasma, and\nbegins to coagulate as soon as it is outside of the human body\n[17,18]. Moreover, \nits rheological behavior depends on \nthe\nhematocrit [14,19], it exhibits viscoelasticity [16,19–21] and\npossesses a yield stress [22]. This rheological behavior is important\nin crime scene reconstruction because it can affect the atomization\nprocess [23–26], which is diminished in liquids which exhibit\nviscoelastic properties [26–28]. Resultant droplet sizes are also\ninﬂuenced by these effects [29–34] as well as their ﬁnal impact on\nsurfaces [31,35,36]. Additionally, blood droplets are spattered at\nbody temperature and often are subject in ﬂight to air at a different\ntemperature, the effects of which have been investigated [37], but\nnever in the context of BPA.\nWith some of these challenges in mind, several models have\nbeen developed to attempt to better recreate crime scenes.\nIncluding the effect of drag via a probabilistic approach was\nproposed in Refs. [38,39]. Further still, in Ref. [40], both gravity and\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: ayarin@uic.edu (A.L.

The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

Blood spatter patterns were created through the controlled application of pressurized air (20–80 kPa) for 0.1 msec onto sus-\npended blood droplets (2.7–3.2 mm diameter). The resulting disintegration process was captured using high-speed photography. Straight-line triangu-\nlation resulted in a 50% height overestimation, whereas using the lowest calculated height for each spatter pattern reduced this error to 8%.\nIncorporation of projectile motion resulted in a 28% height underestimation. The AO xy-coordinate was found to be very accurate with a maximum\noffset of only 4 mm, while AO size calculations were found to be two- to fivefold greater than expected. Subsequently, reverse triangulation analysis\nrevealed the rotational offset for 26% of stains could not be attributed to measurement error, suggesting that some portion of error is inherent in the\ndisintegration process.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, fluid dynamics, blood\nMeasurements taken from bloodstain spatter patterns at a crime\nscene can be utilized to calculate the associated bloodshed area of\norigin (AO) within a three-dimensional space. Generally, this\ninvolves the resolution of individual spatter patterns, selection of\nsuitable bloodstains within, resolution of impact direction, stain tri-\nangulation to yield a two-dimensional area of convergence, and\nfinally overlaying this with the third dimension, height, by calculat-\ning bloodstain impact angles via the Balthazard formula (1). Once\ndetermined, the AO can prove useful in reconstructing the events\nsurrounding bloodshed. Research examining the accuracy and\nunderlying mechanisms of this methodology is still incomplete.\nWithin the bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) community, varia-\ntion exists in methodologies used for pattern recognition, velocity\ncategorization, stain selection, and stain measurement. Despite this\nvariation, there is a strong scientific foundation for correlations\nbetween certain stain morphology parameters and the AO. These\ninclude impact directionality through the presence of one or more\nspines, triangulation using the long axis (l) of multiple stain ellip-\nses, and the angle of impact using the ratio of the long axis (l) to\nshort axis (w) through application of the Balthazard formula (Eq.\n[1]). By combining all three parameters, the final AO can be estab-\nlished within a three-dimensional space (2).\nsin h ¼ w\nl\nð1Þ\nAs projectile motion has proven difficult to incorporate into AO\nmodeling, straight-line flight paths are assumed with the inherent\nlimitation that the z-coordinate will be consistently overestimated.\nIn response, the BPA community recommends presenting the AO\nz-coordinate as a maximum height calculation (3).\nWith a few exceptions (1,4), research into BPA error rates typi-\ncally utilize a mock crime scene approach, or focus on individual\npassive droplets (5–11). Researchers employing a mock crime\nscene approach are usually attempting to replicate the conditions of\na specific criminal case. This can only provide a rough estimate of\nAO error, because the experiments are highly variable and difficult\nto control. To establish greater control, researchers have turned to\nthe study of passive droplets, which usually involves individual\nblood droplets of a standard size made to fall under the influence\nof gravity alone. However, this approach is limited to investigating\nthe error associated with the AO z-coordinate component, because\ntriangulation of multiple stains within a spatter pattern is required\nto evaluate the AO size and xy-coordinate.\nThis currently limits any complete evaluation of the AO to the\nmock crime scene approach. The consequence of which makes it\nvery difficult to explore the underlying mechanisms related to error.\nTake for example a typical experiment where some force (hand,\nbaseball bat, firearm projectile) is applied to some blood source\n(blood-soaked sponge, pool of blood). Subsequently, AO is triangu-\nlated from the resulting spatter pattern and compared with the\nknown AO. With the exception of z-coordinate overestimation\nresulting from straight-line triangulation, it would be tempting to\nconclude that any observed error must be related to the analyst’s\nmeasurement technique. This overlooks an important variable, high-\nlighted in Fig. 1. Each frame represents a 10-msec interval follow-\ning the impact of a hammer on a pool of blood. This series of\nhigh-speed photographs represents one in a series of disintegration\nevents captured by Taylor et al., available online (http://www.\nameslab.gov/mfrc/rd) (12). It is clear from these images that a num-\nber of complex fluid dynamic events are present. Therefore, it\nseems reasonable to speculate that some degree of AO error might\nbe related to blood displacement and disintegration from an often\ncomplicated and variable collision.\n1Departmental of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of\nToronto, 5 King’s College Road, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G8, Canada.\n2Centre of Forensic Sciences, 25 Grosvenor Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A\n2G8, Canada.\nReceived 18 May 2010; and in revised form 2 Sept. 2010; accepted 11\nSept. 2010.\nJ Forensic Sci, September 2011, Vol. 56, No. 5\ndoi: 10.1111/j.1556-4029.2011.01835.x\nAvailable online at: onlinelibrary.wiley.com\n1136\n\u0002 2011 American Academy of Forensic Sciences"

[20], the LR has been used in evaluations \nby forensic experts of various fields to evaluate the relations \nbetween the evidence and a source, either an individual source \nsuch as a person of interest in a crime or a set of sources \nsharing common identities such as a brand and model, such \nas pens or cameras.\nThese evaluations are made either for analysis obtained from \nrecovered material traces, where the observations are some \nphysicochemical or biological part of the source left at the \nscene, or for pattern or signal evidence, which is an impression \nleft either on a physical surface or in a numerical form by \nthe source, where the observations will be some geometrical, \nstructural, or signal characteristics.\nFor material traces, source-­based evaluations have been made \nbased on chemicals or biological analyses of material traces \nsuch as ink [21]; gasoline [22] or inflammable liquid [23]; drugs \n[24]; glass fragments [25], and, of course, DNA [26]. All these \nsource-­based evaluations relied on statistically assessing the \nimportance of similar (or dissimilar) features between the ob-\nservations and reference data [23].\nFor pattern evidence, source-­based evaluations have been de-\nveloped, for example, in the areas of fingermarks [27], facial \nimages [28], and voice recordings [29] (not a pattern per se \nbut an analogue or digital trace).\nMost of these source-­based evaluations involve a process where \nfeatures of the recovered specimens are compared with features \nor outputs of a known source, such as handwriting compared \nwith the writing of an individual [30], fake identity documents \n(compared with elements from fake document factory [31]), \nor digital images associated with a given camera sensor [32].\nSome of the above evaluations involve a mathematical process, \nwhich quantifies the correspondence of features between ev-\nidence and source, and also rely on databases to determine \nhow rare the corresponding features are.\nThe availability of databases is critical to the assignment of \nprobabilities to the observations. Indeed, [23] mentions that the \nperformance of an LR evaluation depends on several factors, \nincluding the scarcity of the databases used as populations; the \nmismatch in the conditions of the materials in the population \ndatabases and in the specimens; and the degraded quality or \nquantity of the materials. Also, approaches based on LRs need \nto be validated, via performance assessments, measurements \nof discriminative power, and calibration [16,23,33]. There are \ntwo main components that will impact the LR at source level: \nthe within-­source variability and the between-­sources variabil-\nity. DNA evidence is among the fields where assignments of \nLRs at source level are the most advanced. The within-­source \nvariability is almost null (the DNA profile is stable over the \nlifetime), and the availability of a biological model, coupled with \nknown allele frequency data, makes the LR calculation well \nunderstood, standardized, and widely accepted [34]. For some \nareas (such as glass fragments, fibers, or footwear marks), the \nknowledge associated within-­ and between-­sources variability \nis informed by structured data and documented knowledge.\nAt this point, it is important to stress that we are discussing \nthe likelihood ratio approach as an overarching method useful \nto help the interpretation of forensic observations. It invites \nthe forensic practitioner to assess the probabilities of the ob-\nservations given one or the other propositions, but we do \nnot want to be prescriptive as to how these probabilities (or \nlikelihood ratios) should be conveyed. These could either be \nexpressed numerically (as advised by the ENFSI guideline [2]) \nor according to the more flexible approach suggested by the \nlatest FSR document [4], where only computed likelihood ratio \nbased on adequate (or limited) data is reported numerically, \nand a verbal scale is used for qualitative assessments without \ndata, solely based on experience.\nAt times, experts will thus rely more on informed judgement \nthan structured datasets, for example, to assess how a feature \nmay evolve over time due to the wear of a shoe. By “informed \njudgement,” we mean that the expert relies partly on their \nmental database (examples they have come across in their \npractice, to the extent that they can remember).\nThe above leads us to suggest a hierarchy of methods and \nknowledge used by forensic scientists to assess their find-\nings. This hierarchy is reported in Figure 1, which may help \ncompare the methods and scope of BPA with those of other \nforensic disciplines.\nThe horizontal axis of Figure 1 is linked to the number of \nvariables, nature of data, and expertise required. On the left \nside of the horizontal axis, we have knowledge derived from \nstudies, ideally published, and peer-­reviewed, where the rele-\nvant features have been systematically measured and studied \nstatistically, together with knowledge from models based on \nsciences such as physics, chemistry, or biology. On the right \nside of the horizontal axis, specialists will rely on knowledge \nderived from personal experience, that is, the expert's training \nand professional experience in the forensic technique, up to \nmere opinion (on the extreme right of the axis). The more \nspecialists base their assignments of probability on relevant, \npeer-­reviewed, publicly available, and robust data, the greater \nis the trustworthiness of those assignments. The more they \nbase their assignments on their recalled experience and knowl-\nedge and on their intuition, the more these assignments will \nbe open to justified challenge.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Here, we explored accuracy and contextual inﬂuence in bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation,\nand how these variables might relate to analyst characteristics. Thirty-nine bloodstain pattern analysts with vary-\ning degrees of experience each completed measures of compliance, decision-making style, and need for closure.\nAnalysts then examined a bloodstain pattern without any additional contextual information, and allocated votes\nto listed pattern types according to favoured and less favoured classiﬁcations. Next, if they believed it would assist\nwith their classiﬁcation, analysts could request items of contextual information – from commonly encountered\nsources of information in bloodstain pattern analysis – and update their vote allocation. We calculated a shift\nscore for each item of contextual information based on vote reallocation. Almost all forms of contextual informa-\ntion inﬂuenced decision-making, with medical ﬁndings leading to the highest shift scores. Although there was a\nsmall positive association between shift scores and the degree to which analysts displayed an intuitive decision-\nmaking style, shift scores did not vary meaningfully as a function of experience or the other characteristics\nmeasured. Almost all of the erroneous classiﬁcations were made by novice analysts.\n© 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction\nForensic science is currently at a crossroads. The reliability of conclu-\nsions about forensic evidence, and the methods used to reach those con-\nclusions, are ﬁrmly under the microscope. This juncture is largely due to\nthe much talked about National Research Council (NRC) report [1] into\nthe state of forensic science. This report highlighted the need for known\nerror rates in forensic science, and recommended that forensic disci-\nplines acknowledge the role of the examiner in the interpretation pro-\ncess. In particular, the report recognised the need for research into the\neffect of contextual information on the interpretation process [1]. Con-\ntext effects in forensic science are commonly referred to as contextual\nbias—a term that typically describes the unconscious inﬂuence of irrel-\nevant information on judgements.\nPrior to the publication of the NRC report [1], research into the\nperformance of forensic experts was sparse and had primarily focussed\non ﬁngerprint evidence [2,3]. This research highlighted a high degree of\nsubjectivity in ﬁngerprint interpretation, showing that ﬁngerprint\ndecisions are vulnerable to bias. Now, many other forensic disciplines\nhave faced the same scrutiny, with investigations into contextual bias\nbeing carried out in forensic odontology [4,5], handwriting examination\n[6], forensic anthropology [7], shoeprint examination [8], bullet com-\nparison [9], DNA interpretation [10], and bloodstain pattern analysis\n[11,12]. The general consensus from this research is that forensic inter-\npretations are vulnerable to contextual bias—a ﬁnding that is not sur-\nprising to psychological scientists, who have long investigated these\nbasic human decision-making processes [e.g.,13,14].\nIn response to this growing body of literature, forensic laboratories\naround the world are developing ways to minimise the potential for\ncontextual bias [6,15,16]. In Australia, for example, the Victoria Police\nForensic Services Department has introduced a system of contextual\ninformation management for handwriting examinations [6]. Here, a\ndesignated context manager removes all irrelevant contextual details\nbefore passing the document on to be examined. Consequently, there\nis minimal chance for irrelevant contextual details to cloud judgement.\nImplementing this type of bias-minimising procedure would also be\nrelatively uncomplicated for many other forensic disciplines, such as\nﬁngerprint interpretation, shoeprint examination, and DNA interpreta-\ntion. The interpretation of such evidence requires minimal to no\nadditional contextual information, and most or all contextual details\ncan be removed.\nNot all forensic disciplines, however, are presented with such a\nstraightforward solution to eliminating the negative effects of context.\nScience and Justice 56 (2016) 123–128\n⁎ Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: nosborne@psy.otago.ac.nz (N.K.P.

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

The videos used in this analysis were focused on a variety of\ntargets hit by a bullet which caused either forward, backward, or both types of blood spatter. The analysis\nprocess utilized particle image velocimetry (PIV) and particle analysis software to measure drop\nvelocities as well as the distributions of the number of droplets and their respective side view area. The\nresults of this analysis revealed that the maximal velocity in the forward spatter can be about 47 \u0001 5 m/s\nand for the backward spatter – about 24 \u0001 8 m/s. Moreover, our measurements indicate that the number\nof droplets produced is larger in forward spatter than it is in backward spatter. In the forward and\nbackward spatter the droplet area in the side-view images is approximately the same. The upper angles of\nthe close-to-cone domain in which droplets are issued in forward and backward spatter are, 27 \u0001 9\u0003 and\n57 \u0001 7\u0003, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-cone domain are 28 \u0001 12\u0003 and 30 \u0001 18\u0003,\nrespectively. The inclination angle of the bullet as it penetrates the target is seen to play a large role in the\ndirectional preference of the spattered blood. Also, muzzle gases, bullet impact angle, as well as the\naerodynamic wake of the bullet are seen to greatly inﬂuence the ﬂight of the droplets. The intent of this\ninvestigation is to provide a quantitative basis for current and future research on bloodstain pattern\nanalysis (BPA) of either forward or backward blood spatter due to a gunshot.\nPublished by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\n1. Introduction\nWorking for project No. 06-S-02 for the Midwest Forensics\nResource Center (MFRC), T.L. Laber, B.P. Epstein, and M.C. Taylor\ntook \na \nseries \nof \nover \n500 \nhigh-speed \nvideos \nof \ncommon\nbloodletting mechanisms [2]. The set of videos includes blood\nspatter formation due to a gunshot, blood spatter due to a blunt\nobject such as a hammer, or blood drop formation from a single\ndroplet and is located on the MFRC website [1]. In literature, the\nvideos have been referred to before [3–5], and are routinely used in\nbloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) presentation and training classes.\nHowever, a quantitative analysis of this dataset is still unavailable,\nespecially for the scenario of blood spatter due to a gunshot.\nAccordingly, the aim of the present work is in quantitative analysis\nof blood spatter induced by a gunshot to facilitate the BPA\ncommunity tools for scientiﬁc analysis of a crime scene event.\nBlood is a complex non-Newtonian ﬂuid which is shear-\nthinning [6–8], exhibits viscoelastic behavior [8–11] and possesses\na yield stress [12]. It is an aqueous suspension which contains\nplasma and particles such as white and red blood cells, and\nplatelets. Blood starts to coagulate when it leaves the body or\nunder conditions of increased shear stress [13]. The rheology of\nblood could affect the atomization process [14–16] which is of\nfundamental importance for BPA because it determines the\ndistribution of drop sizes and velocities [17], thus the resulting\nblood spatter. The atomization is diminished by the effects of\nviscoelasticity [18–20], and the resulting size of the impacting\ndroplets can be heavily inﬂuenced by viscosity and elasticity of\nliquid [21–26]. Therefore, an accurate crime scene reconstruction\nfrom any crime involving blood spatter must account for the\nrheological behavior of blood.\nThe uncertainties of different BPA techniques can be signiﬁcant,\nup to a 50% overestimation of the height of the origin of a blood\nspatter [5]. A better understanding of the mechanisms of\nblood droplet formation and ﬂight is required. The ﬁrst theoretical\nsteps in this direction are already available [27].

Figure courtesy of Jiaming Zhang & Erqiang Li.\nFUTURE ISSUES\n1. Following the seminal discovery of Xu et al. (2005) that splashing is suppressed by re-\nduced air pressure, many groups have tried to ﬁnd the underlying mechanism. Numerous\nproposals have recently been put forth, some of which could be correct. The main focus is\nnow on the levitation of the tip of the lamella as it travels along the substrate (Latka et al.\n2012, Stevens et al. 2014, Riboux & Gordillo 2014, Liu et al. 2015). Improved imaging\nshould pinpoint the most promising explanations for the different impact conditions to\nshow whether a single uniﬁed splashing theory exists.\n2. One uncertainty in this regard is the fuzzy deﬁnition of the splashing boundary, especially\nin the presence of surface roughness. Random roughness will inherently give random\nresults, making it nontrivial to determine the splashing limit (e.g., see the large overlap\nof the splashing and deposition regimes observed in Roisman et al. 2015). High-speed\nmicrosplashing may also have been overlooked by early researchers (Thoroddsen et al.\n2012). Furthermore, drops larger than the capillary length are easily deformed from the\nspherical shape, and air drag in free fall can ﬂatten them. This invariable affects impact\noutcomes (Thoroddsen et al. 2005, Mishra et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2013) but was not\ncharacterized in many earlier studies.\n3. Finding and predicting the splashing threshold are worthwhile quests in and of them-\nselves. However, of greater practical importance will be to fully characterize the resulting\nsplash. The size and number of the ﬁnest droplets are important, for example, for the gen-\neration of aerosols. Trajectories of droplets are important for the uniformity of coatings,\ncontamination, or rain erosion.\n384\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

The impact pushes through regular\nmicrodroplets with sizes similar to the individual hole size (Figure 9a).

(2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

This was owing to the amount of time it\nwould take to fully wet the high linear density yarns of the medium\nand heavy calico as the blood was only soaking through from the\ntechnical face of the fabric. When investigating spatter bloodstains\non three 100% cotton knitted fabrics with different yarn linear\ndensities, as with the current work on calico, it was found the\nsmallest bloodstains were on the fabric with the greatest yarn\nlinear density [28]. The greater the yarn linear density, the more air\nspaces there are between the ﬁbres, therefore the more blood\nwhich is required to fully wet the yarns, before wicking can occur.\nThe blood remaining on the surface of the fabric would dry before\nmuch wicking along the yarns was able to occur. 1.7 ms\u00011 is the\nonly velocity where the heavy calico specimens had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area (Fig. 3). As the predominant method by\nwhich the bloodstains are being created on the medium and heavy\ncalico at this velocity is wicking vertically into the fabric under\ngravity, the greater yarn linear density of the heavy than either the\nmedium or light calico would reduce the ability of the blood to\nwick into the heavy calico.\nOn all three fabrics for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts the blood which\nremained on the surface of the fabric dried in the manner of the\ncoffee ring effect (Fig. 8a–c, marked ‘B’) [29,30]. The coffee ring\neffect occurs in many colloidal ﬂuids when the solutes move to the\npinned edge of the liquid drop to compensate for evaporative\nlosses [31]. This results in a higher concentration of particulates at\nthe edge of the drop than the centre, and is evidenced by a ring of\ndense blood surrounding the parent bloodstain.\nAs a larger volume of blood remained on the surface of the\nmedium and heavy calicos than the light calico, the coffee ring\neffect was more pronounced. The coffee ring effect occurred more\nextensively for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts as blood pooled on the surface of\nall fabrics following impact and dried before wicking occurred.\nFig. 2.

Introduction \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal and homicidal \ngunshots is mainly based on \nthe entrance wound \nmorphology \nand the detection of gunshot residues on the \nshooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, \nthe appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the \nweapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute \nsubstantially \nto the \nreconstruction \nof the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular \nat autopsy, \nthe naked-eye \ndetection of biological \ntraces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great \nimportance \nfor a preliminary \ndiagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of \ncases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without \nextensive analysis, \nthe present study was performed. \nAnother \naspect of the study was to provide \ninformation \non the frequency of conjunctival \npetechiae in head shot fatalities and \nto investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot \nwounds to the head in cases in which an examination \nof the entrance injury cannot \nbe performed. \n2. Material \nand methods \nIn the period January \n1991 -November \n1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 \nhomicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction \nwere autopsied at \nthe Department \nof Legal Medicine, \nMunich, \nGermany. The individual \nage ranged \nbetween 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by \nfemales, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence \nof visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and \nof petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwas recorded in contact or distant \nshot wounds. \nDifferentiation \nwas made between the localization \nof the injuries \n(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol \nrifle/shotgun). \n3. Results \nIn 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the \nhead (right \nor left temple, frontal, \nnose, cheek-bone, mouth, \nchin, submental, \noccipital) \nor the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in \nnone of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) \nwere blood spatters found on the hands. \nIn 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 \ncases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining \n11 fatalities the type \nof the gun was not recorded in the investigation \nfiles. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot \nsuicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection \n(revolvers \n33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns \n27% and 27% of the fatalities \nwith \nunknown \nweapons). Visible \npowder \nsoilings were additionally \ndetected in two \nfurther suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but \nno blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand.

Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

The reason for this is that the timescale of\nimpact phenomena with a bullet is very short, regardless of the\nbullet type.\nFor the initial moments of penetration of a sharp bullet, the\ninitial velocity and acceleration of the blood at the target surface\nare respectively,\nv ¼ u2V0h\nr\n; \nð3Þ\nA ¼ u2V2\n0\nr\n; \nð4Þ\nwhere u is the semi-angle of the bullet generatrix, and h is the\ndepth of bullet penetration which is a function of the time since\nimpact, t. Note that the depth of bullet penetration h can be\npredicted as a function of time t, for example, using Eqs. (17) and\n(18) from Ref. [41].\nEqs. (2) and (4) describe the acceleration of denser blood at the\nfree surface towards lighter air. Such a situation is inherently\nunstable and results in the Rayleigh–Taylor instability [43]. This\ninstability results in the characteristic droplet sizes, l\u0007, issued\nbackward from the free surface, which is given by the following\nexpression,\nl\u0007 ¼\n2p\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nrA=ð3sÞ\np\nw; \nð5Þ\nwhere r is the density of the blood (1060 kg/m3 [16]), s is its\nsurface tension (60.45 mN/m [16]), and w is a dimensionless factor.\nA possible variation of the density and surface tension with\ntemperature is not included in the models discussed here, because\nfor liquids, surface tension variation in a reasonable temperature\ninterval is not large, and, moreover, surface tension s enters Eq. (5)\nas\nﬃﬃﬃs\np , which minimizes the effect of temperature even further. The\ndensity variation with temperature is practically insigniﬁcant.\nThe Rayleigh–Taylor instability links the ﬂow ﬁeld of blood in\nthe target splashed backward by a gunshot to the generation of\nindividual droplets, a link which common BPA techniques such as\nthe method of strings, do not contain. This makes the aforemen-\ntioned models [41,42] physical in nature, i.e. linking the blood\nspatter pattern to the bullet shape and the gunshot parameters.\nNote also that in Ref. [42], the spray angle of blood droplets from\nthe target with respect to the axis of the bullet was predicted to be\n13\u0001 using the hydrodynamic theory of turbulent submerged jets.\nThe splashed blood droplet trajectories are predicted by models\n[41,42] using momentum balance equations accounting for the\neffects of gravity and air drag affected by droplet-droplet\naerodynamic interactions (the latter being a collective effect).\nThis collective effect stems from the entrainment of air by the\nleading droplets, the aerodynamic wake of which diminishes air\ndrag on the subsequent droplets and can even accelerate them, as\nshown in Ref. [52] and highlighted in Fig. 3. This is similar to a ﬂock\nof geese ﬂying in V-formation where the leading goose experiences\nlarger air drag than those behind it and thus essentially pulls the\nothers. Eventually, the leading goose will be switched to a position\nin the back of the formation and this results in a ﬂock which can ﬂy\nfurther [53]. The bullet used to create the velocity history plot of\nFig. 3 closely resembles a sharp one and as such can help further\nvalidate the framework of the models. The range of initial velocities\npredicted with Eq. (3) is superimposed on Fig. 3 and shows that the\ncalculated values are appropriate. Furthermore, the data used in\nFig. 3 allows for an average 2D area to be found from the droplets\nwhich experimentally was 0.084 mm2, whereas assuming a\ncircular area with the diameter calculated in Eq. (5), the theory\npredicts an average droplet area of 0.079 mm2.\nFor the simulation of the backward spatter of blood on a vertical\nwall (cf. Fig. 1), the cardstock target was discretized into 10 even\nrings spanning the minimum and maximum radial distances from\nthe bullet penetration hole. The median distance of each ring from\nthe center of the hole is R. For the number of stains, the stains in\neach ring were added together, for the stain area and impact angle,\nthey were averaged in each ring. Comparisons of the predicted and\nFig. 2.

Droplets were produced from a series of conical nozzles,\nmanufactured with a range of cone angles and including a set of un-bored conical tips, under conditions\nwhere the tip was either non-wetted or pre-wetted with blood. For the former, radius-limited case,\ndetached droplet volumes were found to agree well with the predictions of both the pendent drop weight\nand drop shape models. For pre-wetted tips, droplet volumes were found to increase with increasing\ncone angle and to be independent of whether the blood ﬂow was through an oriﬁce at the tip or across the\ntip surface itself for un-bored tips. Such angle-limited, detached droplet volumes were predicted well by\napplying the same contact angle correction factor as for a ﬂat surface. The maximum droplet volume,\nformed from a horizontal ﬂat surface, was found to be around 150 mL for horse blood. Similar theoretical\napproaches were then extended to droplets released under centrifugal force appropriate to swing cast-off\nactivity and evaluated using previously published experimental data. Order of magnitude agreement for\ndroplet diameters was fairly good but, more importantly, these were found to be proportional to the\ninverse of the tangential velocity thereby supporting a model where the blood droplet is released directly\nfrom a blood mass itself, such as a ligament, rather than from being pinned to some surface feature or\noriﬁce on the weapon. This work provides a sound theoretical and experimental understanding of blood\ndroplet release under these conditions that can underpin both future research and the interpretation of\nblood evidence in case-work.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\nOver recent years there have been many published studies\nexploring the science underpinning bloodstain pattern analysis.\nAmongst this literature, many of these [1–9] have focused on the\ndynamics of blood droplets, surface impact and stain formation,\nincluding impact angle and surface texture effects, whilst others\nhave investigated \npattern \nformation \nitself, \nfor \nexample \nby\nanalysing droplet trajectories and the methodologies used in\ncase-work examination and interpretation [10–15]. In contrast,\nthere are fewer examples where the initial formation of the blood\ndroplets themselves has been studied, for example on weapon tips,\nand speciﬁcally the factors which govern the volume of the droplet\nreleased whether under passive (drip from a static source) or active\n(for example, from swing cast-off) conditions [16–18]. Studies of\nthese factors, for the most part, have focused on experimental\ninvestigations rather than exploration of the theoretical basis for\ndroplet formation and the veriﬁcation of such mathematical\nmodels against those experimental data.\nThis present work was designed to ﬁll this gap in the literature\nby reviewing and developing current understanding of the\nmechanisms underpinning the formation and adhesion of blood\ndroplets at oriﬁces and on surfaces – the pendent drop – and the\nconditions under which droplets are released, either under gravity\nalone or under the centrifugal force generated during swing cast-\noff. To test and evaluate such a quantitative, theoretical approach, a\nseries of experiments was carried out to obtain data on the\nrelationship between the size, shape and properties of the oriﬁce\nor surface and the volume of blood droplets formed on passive\nrelease. This was achieved by using bored and un-bored conical\nbrass tips machined at a variety of angles as models for weapon tips\nof differing sharpness. In this study particular attention was paid to\nthe degree of wetting of the surface by the blood and the\nconsequent size of the detached droplet. In addition, quantitative\ndata already published, from model swing cast-off studies [12,16],\nhas been used in a similar fashion to evaluate mathematical\nmodels for the active release of blood droplets.\nE-mail address: c.d.adam@keele.ac.uk (C.D.

RBCs accumulate at the edge of the drop. When\nthe desiccation phenomenon occurs on the glass substrate, a decrease in volume is\nobserved due to the large amount of water required.

Furthermore, the RBCs present at their surface\nproteins induce a hydrophobic behaviour with all materials. This is observed with\nglass.

This enables a cracking phenomenon linked with\nthe diameter of the drop, and consequently with the perimeter of the corona. For\nsmall drop perimeters, the stress inside the RBCs solid deposit is small compared\nwith large drop diameters.\n5. Concluding remarks\nObservations of the Marangoni ﬂow motion inside a drop of blood using a digital\ncamera at a good resolution (about 2.3 µm) enable us to show that the motion of\nRBCs at the edge of the drop is the main mechanism of blood drop evaporation and\ndeposition. The mechanisms involved in the blood drop evaporation are conﬁrmed\nthrough the evaporation mass ﬂux which is measured to be in agreement with a\npure water drop evaporation. Other biological elements (white blood cells, proteins)\nare transported to the edge of the drop with the RBCs and contribute to the\npattern formation through the deposit wettability with the substrate and mechanical\nproperties. The blood evaporation dynamic can be predicted by a comparison with\nthe pure ﬂuid evaporation case corrected by the mass concentration in colloids.\nTotally diﬀerent patterns are formed according to whether the person is healthy or\nsuﬀers from anaemia or hyperlipidaemia.

Introduction\nBloodstain pattern analysis has several applications in crime\nscene reconstruction, informing on the sequence and timing of the\nevents, their mode of operation, and the location of blood sources.\nThe latter application is known as the determination of the region of\norigin and involves the inspection of bloodstains and the backward\nreconstruction of trajectories. Current methodologies for predicting\nthe origin of a bloodletting event rely on assuming that blood drops\ntravel in straight lines [1]. While simple, the technique involves\nintrinsic inaccuracies since the effect of drag and gravity on drop\nﬂight are unaccounted. These inaccuracies become signiﬁcant as the\ndistance between the origin of the event and the spatter increases, or\nin speciﬁc cases of downward projecting drops [2]. Several extensive\nstudies have also explored the uncertainty associated with an\narbitrary selection of stains or the values of impact angles [3–5].\nTo reconstruct the trajectories backward and account for drag\nand gravity, knowledge of droplet size and impact velocity is\nrequired [6]. These can be estimated from the morphology of the\nbloodstains, by e.g. analyzing their size, volume and number of\nspines [7–9]. In this regard, there is signiﬁcant literature proposing\ncorrelations between stain diameters, droplet sizes, and impact\nvelocities [7,10,11]. A few studies have also demonstrated backward\nreconstruction of trajectories [7,11], albeit without quantifying the\ninﬂuence of speciﬁc target properties and blood hematocrit. Blood is\nindeed a highly complex, shear-thinning, non-Newtonian ﬂuid,\nwhose ﬂow behavior depends on several factors such as: shear rate\n(or the impact velocity), temperature, hematocrit and humidity\n[12–14]. Hematocrit values in human blood of healthy individuals\nvary between values of about 40 to 45% [1,15,16].\nThis manuscript highlights the effect of varying target conditions\nin predicting the trajectories of blood drops.

Similarly, a few impact studies measure the viscosity of the blood\nused in impact experiments. In this work, the impact of blood drops is investigated on targets with a range\nof surface roughness and surface material. The maximum spreading is characterized using a spreading\ncorrelation, which relates the ratio of stain diameter to drop diameter with the non-dimensional numbers\nReynolds number and Ohnesorge number. The process for obtaining individual spreading correlations for\neach of the target substrates and for measuring the viscosity of the respective blood samples is described\nextensively. The error in estimating the drop release height, associated with using an impact correlation\nunspeciﬁc to the target of interest, is estimated analytically and numerically using experimental data.

The purpose of this study is to determine the \napproximate location of the blood source, i.e. the victim, at the crime scene by using an image processing and \nnumerical modeling approach. To achieve this, an experimental setup is designed with cardstocks and a cow \nblood-soaked sponge. In total, twenty forward spatter patterns are obtained onto cardstocks after successful \nshootings. In the post-processing phase, ellipses on the cardstocks are detected by processing the forward spatters \nin MATLAB. To achieve this, ellipse properties are identified for calculating the impact angles. The impact angles \nare then utilized as inputs to the tangent method within the program to estimate the Area of Origin (AOx). For \nvisualization, 2D and 3D images are generated. In conclusion, it is observed that the program works the best in \ndetermining the AOx, for the scenarios where the real AOx distances (blood source to target distances) are 35 cm, \n50 cm, and 100 cm respectively. The program’s weakness while determining AOx for the source distance of 5 cm \nis also reported. It is necessary to improve the program for short blood source-to-target distances and long \nshooting distances. It can be concluded that image quality is also a key factor for post-processing as it might \nmislead the results with visible ellipses.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstains are one of the most significant types of physical evidence \nand can greatly help to establish the connection between the culprit, the \nvictim, and the crime scene. The formation of the stains depends on \nphysical, environmental, and biological factors and can appear in \nvarious sizes and forms [1]. Patterns resulting from a force applied \ndirectly to the source of blood are referred to as impact spatter. Such \nspatters may be caused by firearms, blunt objects, stabbing, electrical \ndevices, or explosions [1]. The size of bloodstains is typically less than \n1 mm or larger, and the velocity of the applied force can start at 30 m/s. \nHowever, there is no direct correlation between stain size and the ve­\nlocity of the applied force [2]. By analyzing the spatter bloodstains, the \nfollowing questions can be answered regarding the crime scene: \n• Possible location and position of the culprit, the victim, and other \nobjects at the scene\n• Chronological order of events\n• Verification or refutation of statements made by the victim, wit­\nnesses, or culprit\nThere are a variety of software and algorithms developed in the \nliterature for the location of the blood source, i.e. Area of Origin (AO) \nestimation in bloodstain pattern analysis [3]. The aim of these methods \nis to estimate AO based on the size, shape and directionality of blood­\nstains. The string method is a well-known traditional method that uses \nphysical strings to determine the AO. This method is time-consuming, \nand its accuracy depends on the performer. Modern approaches use \nprimarily image processing and numerical modeling. The currently \navailable and most used programs include HemoSpat, Sherlock, Back­\nTrack, HemoVision, FARO Scene [3].

The method \ngenerates metrics relating to the individual stains as well as the overall pattern, including bloodstain pattern \nspecific metrics such as the gamma angle, circularity, solidity, area of convergence, stain density and pattern \nlinearity. This method provides an objective approach to the analysis of bloodstains and bloodstain patterns and \ncan generate a wealth of quantitative data that is currently not obtainable using manual techniques or other \nimage-based programs currently utilised in the discipline. This method will be useful to analysts and researchers \ninvestigating the application of quantitative methods to bloodstain pattern analysis.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is a discipline of forensic science \nthat is concerned with the study of the size, shape and distribution of \nbloodstains deposited onto surfaces at bloodletting events, particularly \ncrime scenes. With knowledge of the underlying principles of fluid \nmechanics, the physical characteristics of the stains can be analysed and \nused to assist with the reconstruction of the events that led to the \nbloodshed [1–3]. One of the key tasks in BPA is the classification of \nspatter patterns. Spatter patterns are groups of small circular and \nelliptical shaped bloodstains that have been formed as the result of some \nexternal force being applied to a source of liquid blood [4]. The current \nterminology of the different classes of spatter patterns in BPA relate to \nthe mechanism of the force that caused them. Common types of spatter \npatterns present at crime scenes include impact (caused by an object \nstriking liquid blood), swing cast-off (caused by blood released from a \nbloodstained object due to its swinging motion), and expirated (caused \nby the generation of droplets due to the force involved with the expul­\nsion of blood from the mouth, nose or lungs) [4]. The application of \nthese forces on the liquid blood results in its breakup into smaller \ndroplets that travel through the air away from the blood source. When \nthese predominately spherical droplets land onto nearby surfaces they \ncollapse and spread on the target forming circular and elliptical shaped \nbloodstains.\nBPA can be a valuable tool in investigations; however, the subjec­\ntivity of the discipline has been criticised [5,6] and disagreements be­\ntween trained analysts have been documented in some high-profile cases \n[7,8]. A lack of empirical data and scientific foundations was cited as \nareas needed for improvement [5]. These criticisms have raised doubt \nover the reliability of the evidence that is often delivered in courtrooms. \nIn response, reliability and black box studies have been undertaken to \ninvestigate the accuracy and reliability of bloodstain pattern classifica­\ntion. These studies have shown that some spatter patterns can have high \nerror rates for classification [9–11]. This is not unsurprising as the me­\nchanical process involved in the formation of spatter stains is the same \nregardless of the initial force applied. As a result, there are overlapping \ncharacteristics between different types of spatter patterns (for example, \nthe range of stain sizes in a pattern) which can lead to ambiguity or \nmisclassification. Studies have also shown some analysts are not always \nconsistent with their classifications, classifying the same pattern \ndifferently when unknowingly presented with it a second time [12]. The \ninference being that there is a subjective approach to the classification \nprocess. There have been calls for more systematic guidelines within the \ndiscipline to assist with the classification task, but currently there is still \nno agreed criteria about what features are required to make a classifi­\ncation and the decision is left to the analyst based on their training, \nexperience and level of confidence.\nTo reduce the subjectivity, quantitative methods have been \n* Correspondence to: 27 Creyke Road, Ilam, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: rosalyn.rough@esr.cri.nz (R.

The difference is\napparent from the ﬁrst data point of the analysis at a time from\nthe bullet impact in the 0.4–0.5 ms range, all the way to the end of\nthe experiment. For either caliber, the forward spattered velocity\nis larger than that of the backward spattered velocity, even\nthough in Fig. 1a, the velocity gap is only noticeable starting at the\n0.8–0.9 ms mark from the bullet impact time, which may be due\nto a large number of droplets difﬁcult to resolve. A larger forward\nspatter velocity makes physical sense due to the entraining effect\nof the bullet traveling in the direction of the blood spatter. It is\nalso interesting to note that as the time from the bullet impact\nincreases, the standard deviation of the data, as indicated by the\nerror bars, decreases due to a more uniform ﬂow ﬁeld in the\ncorresponding part of the region of interest. The trend of the steep\ngradient upward and steady decrease in average velocity (cf.\nFig. 1) indicates that at the onset of the analysis which was at\n0.4 ms after the bullet impact, the blood droplets are accelerated.\nThis means (from the second law of Newton applied to an\nindividual droplet) that droplets analyzed at the onset of the PIV\nanalysis practically do not experience air drag but on the contrary,\nare pulled forward by the aerodynamic wake of the fast moving,\nsmall-sized, preceding droplets from the initial splash. This is\nsimilar to the aerodynamic interaction of birds ﬂying in V\nformation [43]. After about 0.6–0.9 ms, the blood droplets ﬁnally\nbegin to slow down due air drag, since at the later stage droplets\nhave already sufﬁciently separated and their mutual aerodynamic\ninteraction has been diminished. It should be emphasized that\nnot only in forward spatter droplets are initially accelerated but\nalso \nin \nthe \nbackward \nspatter \n(cf. \nFig. 1). \nTherefore, \nthis\nacceleration cannot be attributed to the aerodynamic effect of\nbullet preceding droplets in forward spatter but to the mutual\nentrainment of droplets described above.\nThe tape-covered sponge of experiment 7Cb3 only produced\nforward spattered droplets and the results from the PIV analysis\nare shown in Fig. 2. Since the same bullet caliber and shooting\ndistance as in experiment 7Ab1 were used, the results in Fig. 2 can\nbe directly compared to the forward spatter case of Fig. 1b.\nCovering the sponge with tape prevents the onset of backward\nspatter. Due to the spread of the error bars, an accelerated droplet\nmotion due to the aerodynamic wake of the preceding droplets is\nstill plausible, however, it is not directly seen in Fig. 2. The\nmagnitude of the average velocity is approximately that of the\nforward spattered case shown in Fig. 1b. The trend of a decrease in\nthe error bar spread at longer time is still seen, albeit to a lesser\nextent.\nThe two experiments with silicone-covered sponges, 7Db1 and\n7Db2, were conducted using the same caliber of bullet and the\nsame \nshooting \ndistance. \nThe \nresults \nfor \nthe \n7Db1 \nand\n7Db2 experiments are presented in Fig. 3.\nEven though experiments 7Db1 and 7Db2 were conducted under\nexactly the same conditions as indicated in Table 1, 7Db1 only\nresultedin forward spatter, whereas7Db2 revealedbothforwardand\nbackward spatter. This sheds light on the complexity of performing\nrepeatable BPA experiments: it means that for this set of\nFig. 1. PIV results for experiment 7Aa1 are shown in panel (a), and for experiment 7Ab1 in panel (b). The red dashed line with circular data points represents the results from\nforward spatter, and the solid blue line with square data points is for backward spatter.

Meyer\nIFFB Gerichtsmedizin und Forensische Neuropsychiatrie, Paris-Lodron Universita¨t Salzburg, O¨sterreich, Austria\nIn cases of unclear circumstances, the deposition of bloodstains,\nespecially backspatter on a ﬁrearm or a shooter, can considerably\nassist in the reconstruction of shooting incidents. In shots to the\nhead, biological material (such as blood and brain tissue) is ejected\nback towards the weapon. This phenomenon can lead to the\ndeposition of bloodstains on the trigger, trigger guard, weapon and\nsupporting hand and thus can be used to determine whether and in\nwhich position a person has ﬁred a weapon. [1–4] However, in\ncertain cases a peculiar distribution of bloodstains on the hand of a\nvictim can cause confusion. In this case, atypical bloodstain pattern\ncould be seen on the hands of a probable suicide victim. Due to the\nexcessive bloodstains on the right side of the body, the position of\nthe gun on the left side of the body and no motive, an autopsy was\nperformed.\n1. Case background\nA 90-year-old man was discovered dead in his house. He was\nfound sitting in an upright position, leaning back against a folded\ndeck chair (Fig. 1). The right side of his body was profusely covered\nin blood. A blood pool could also be seen on the ground next to him,\noriented towards his right elbow. In the right temporal region,\nthere was a circular wound, which was covered with blood. On the\nleft side of the body, a pistol was detected (Fig. 2). The left arm\nrested on his left thigh. According to family members, the deceased\ndid not mention any suicidal intentions, and there was no history\nof mental or physical illness. A suicide note was not found.\n2. Weapon\nThe weapon used was a ‘Walter PPK 7.65’, a blowback-operated\nsemi-automatic pistol with a traditional double-action trigger\nmechanism and a single-column magazine, calibre 7.65 mm (Fig.\n3). The pistol was in the lawful possession of the deceased.\nUncharacteristic bloodstains were found on the ﬁrearm. The\ndistribution of blood showed no preferential site. Inconsistent\ndroplets were widely spread over the weapon. An angle of\nincidence could not be calculated. Projected patterns were mainly\nfound on the right outer side of the slide. Individual stains were\neven detected on the rear side of the grip. No bloodstains could be\nseen in the lower region of the grip.\n3.

Apart from the location of the entrance wound, wound path trajectory\nand gunshot residue, blood stain pattern analysis of gunshot-related backspatter on the hands of the\nvictim can be an essential tool not only to determine which hand was holding the ﬁrearm, but also to\nreconstruct the position from which a weapon was ﬁred. We present a case of a 90-year-old man, who\nwas found dead in his house. Because of unclear circumstances and an unusual position of the deceased\nwith a gunshot entrance wound to the right temporal region and a ﬁrearm found on the left side of his\nbody, an autopsy was performed. Due to the unusual bloodspatter stains on the hands and the ﬁrearm, it\nwas possible to deduce the position and orientation of the hands and the ﬁrearm of the deceased. We\ncould reconstruct that the man held the weapon in his right hand, using the left hand to stabilise the\nﬁrearm and the right thumb to pull the trigger.

Image processing algorithm & analysis\nThe MATLAB code for this study is based on the numerical calcula­\ntion of the AO of a bloodstain pattern on a flat and light-colored surface \nat the crime scene by processing an image containing bloodstains. The \ncode initially receives a bloodstain pattern image from the user. In the \ncase of a colored image, the code converts it to black-and-white for \nbetter identification of the stains. Later, it converts the image to binary \nformat so that the bloodstains appear as white on a black background. \nWith the ‘regionprops’ function, the code analyzes each of the ellipses in \nthe image and calculates their major and minor axis lengths, eccen­\ntricities, centroids, and areas. Using these features, it selects bloodstains \nthat are small, elliptical, and within a certain size range (the minimum \narea for selected ellipses is 5-pixel, whereas the maximum area for \nselected ellipses is 500-pixel) so that only the appropriate stains are \nutilized in the analysis.\nBy utilizing the discussed methodology, a set of cardstocks that are \nthe outcome of the experiment which are the combination of different \nreal AOx distances and different shooting distances are analyzed. The \nreal AOx distances are 5 cm, 35 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm while the \nFig. 1.

Splashing arises\nfrom the breakup of a ﬁne liquid sheet that is ejected radially along the sub-\nstrate. Bouncing and deposition depend crucially on the wetting properties\nof the substrate. In this review, we focus on recent experimental and theoret-\nical studies, which aim at unraveling the underlying physics, characterized\nby the delicate interplay of not only liquid inertia, viscosity, and surface ten-\nsion, but also the surrounding gas. The gas cushions the initial contact; it\nis entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the\nso-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid. Particular\nattention is paid to the inﬂuence of surface roughness, natural or engineered\nto enhance repellency, relevant in many applications.\n365\nClick here to view this article's\nonline features:\n \n• Download ﬁgures as PPT slides\n• Navigate linked references\n• Download citations\n• Explore related articles\n• Search keywords\nANNUAL \nREVIEWS\n \nFurther"

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis.

This concludes the desiccation of the drop and no\nfurther changes are observed.\nAll patterns observed with dried drops of blood present similar characteristics: the\ncentral part of the drop, the wide mobile plaques of the corona with wide white cracks,\nand the ﬁne periphery (ﬁgure 2). Whereas the central part of the drop and the ﬁne\nperiphery stick onto the glass plate due to the absence of RBCs, the corona is where\nmobile deposits form and these do not adhere to the substrate. The explanation of\nthis wetting phenomenon lies in the proteins which exist on the RBCs (glycoproteins).\nThe function of these proteins is to avoid wettability with a wall and, in particular,\nthe internal wall of organs, veins.\nAt the beginning of drop evaporation, the ﬂuid is homogeneous in colloids, this is\nwhy a thin periphery can dry on the glass plate. However, since Marangoni convection\nis occurring, the RBCs (and other heavy colloids) accumulate at the drop triple line,\nwhich is receding. The RBCs accumulate by Marangoni convection to form a solid\ndeposit which will be called hereafter ‘the corona’. The remaining ﬂuid, which consists\nmainly of serum without heavy colloids, leads to typical small-sized patterns adhering\nto the glass substrate after its evaporation.\n3.2.

    "text_chunk": "calculations. In this experiment, the stain selection criteria favored\nlarger stains. With this in mind, the larger droplets within the high-\nspeed images were found to be >0.8 mm diameter and traveling\n<3 m⁄sec. Therefore, ignoring drag is expected to introduce no\nmore than 30% error in predicting the z-coordinate in this experi-\nment. This is quite substantial and highlights that any attempt to\nincorporate projectile motion into AO modeling must take drag into\naccount.\nAO error associated with size and xy-coordinate was calculated\nusing the stain triangulation lines at the point with which they\ncrossed the known x-axis, which runs perpendicular to the spatter\nflight direction. For each spatter pattern, the xy-coordinate was\nmeasured as the average offset between each triangulation line and\nthe known xy-coordinate, while AO size was measured as the 95%\nconfidence interval of this average. These calculations are presented\nin Fig. 12.\nNo statistically significant correlations were found between the\nobserved errors, and blood volumes and velocities tested. XY-coor-\ndinates were found to be quite accurate, with the least accurate\nspatter pattern deviating from the known xy-coordinate by only\n4 mm. On the other hand, the AO size was found to be larger than\nexpected. The known blood droplet diameters tested were 2.7 and\n3.2 mm, while the calculated sizes ranged between 7.8 and\n14.3 mm, representing a two- to fivefold increase. Further analysis\nof these results revealed a number of outliers present within each\ntrial. This was investigated further.\nOne of the 24 spatter patterns was selected randomly for addi-\ntional analysis. The stain selection criteria were lowered to include\nstains that could provide a measure of directionality only. This\nresulted in the selection of 54 stains. For the purpose of this analy-\nsis, instead of starting at each stain and triangulating ‘‘backward,’’\nthe known xy-position was used as the starting point and lines were\ndrawn ‘‘forward’’ out to each stain. Where each line overlapped the\ncorresponding stain, the rotational offset could then be evaluated.\nOf these 54 stains, the rotational offsets of 14 (26%) were signifi-\ncant enough that it was reasonable to assume that any individual\ntasked with fitting an ellipse to a bloodstain was unlikely to have\narrived at the same triangulation line. Four of these representative\nstains are shown in Fig. 13 each with their corresponding triangula-\ntion path originating from the known xy-coordinate. This finding\nclearly demonstrates that a component of AO error is not related to\nanalyst measurement but is instead inherent in the process of blood\ndisplacement and disintegration.\nPostimpact droplet formation is the most likely mechanism for\nthis contribution to AO size error. This ‘‘fork in the road’’ effect\noccurs when a blood volume structure (sheet, filament, or large\ndroplet) has traveled a certain distance from the AO and reaches\nan instability threshold where it disintegrates into smaller volumes.\nSubsequently, trajectory lines for these respective bloodstains will\ntriangulate back to this fork in the road where secondary disintegra-\ntion occurred, instead of back to the true AO. Given that this\nexperiment was designed to reduce the complexity of droplet disin-\ntegration, it is likely that this will be more predominant under\nbloodshed conditions more typically associated with crime scenes.\nConclusion\nSmall volumes of blood were disintegrated through the applica-\ntion of pressurized air. The resulting spatter patterns were used to\nevaluate BPA AO error and investigate the underlying mechanisms.\nUnder these experimental conditions, z-coordinate predictions were\nconsistently overestimated by an average of 50%, while using the\nlowest z-coordinate within a spatter pattern reduced this error to\n8%. However, if this value is to be reported, it should be presented\nas an estimate and not as a maximum height calculation. Incorpora-\ntion of projectile motion into z-coordinate calculations was found\nto underestimate by an average of 28%, while velocity predictions\nwere found to be quite accurate when compared with the high-\nspeed photographs. However, the application of projectile motion is\nlimited at this time as an assumption related to launch angle was\nrequired,\nand\nthe\nimpact\nof\ndrag\ncould\nnot\nbe\nignored.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nvelocity (m/sec)\nerror (%)\nD = 0.2mm\nD = 0.4mm\nD = 0.6mm D = 0.8mm\nD = 1.0mm\nD = 1.2mm\nD = 1.4mm\nD = 1.6mm\nFIG. 11—Effect of drag forces on blood droplets between 0.2 and 1.6 mm\nin diameter, traveling up to 10 m ⁄ sec.

Factors inﬂuencing the use of luminol\nWhile luminol preparation and application is rather simple,\ninterpretation of results is more challenging. Interpretation of\nluminol chemiluminescence characteristics and patterns at the\ncrime scene should take into consideration the physical struc-\nture of the substrate upon which the bloodstains are found, the\nchemical composition of the substrate possessing the stains and\nany other substances present on the substrate.\n3.2.1. Physical nature of substrate\nThe ﬁrst issue confronting the forensic practitioner when\nusing the luminol test at a crime scene is a consideration of the\nphysicalnatureofthesubstratespossessingthestains[51,63,73].\nSubstrates can be divided roughly into two groups: absorbent\nmaterials and non-absorbent materials.\nAbsorbent materials encompass substrates with irregular\nporous surfaces such as wood-ﬁnish panelling, walls, and inter-\nstitial spaces between tiles or wood objects which, due to the\ngrooves or cracks onto the surface, show superﬁcial absorbent\nproperties and are able to keep blood remains, even after vig-\norous scrubbing, for a long time [63,73]. In this group can be\nincluded also substrates with much greater absorbing properties\nsuch as carpeting, leather clothes, fabric clothes, roof-linings,\nblankets, etc.\nAbsorbent materials represent fairly easy surfaces to ana-\nlyze because they often can retain signiﬁcant amounts of blood,\nmaintaining it in relatively undegraded form even for many\nyears, thus giving intense reaction with the luminol test. This\nis primarily due to rapid drying of blood, especially in domes-\ntic or covered environments, thus preventing its degradation by\nenvironmental biological agents such as bacterial hydrolytic\nenzymes. Moreover, these substrates can protect blood from\nphysical or chemical environmental agents such as solar rays,\nmoisture and water, or cleaning attempts after the crime has been\ncommitted [63,73].\nDue to the structure and to the relatively large quantity of\nblood that may be absorbed, absorbent materials are resistant\nto cleaning with bleach and/or soapy water. It is also possible\nto spray multiple applications of the luminol reagent with-\nout the risk of excessively diluting the stains in order to best\nvisualize and to successfully photograph the bloodstain pattern\n[63,73].\nNon-absorbent substrates such as non-textured linoleum,\nvinyl, tile, glass, metal and many others, present more difﬁculties\nboth in the reagent application and in the quality of chemilu-\nminescence. These substrate surfaces are unable to effectively\nretain and store blood and, moreover, cannot prevent its degra-\ndation especially by physical and chemical agents. As clearly\ndemonstrated by Lytle and Hedgecock [73], these surfaces are\nfairly easy to completely clean and a mild washing attempt by\nwater and soap lead to the removal of the bloodstains yielding\nalmost non-existent reaction with luminol.\nA further complication is that the application of luminol solu-\ntions to non-absorbent surfaces can lead to the bloodstain pattern\nrunning, due to the limited retention of the resulting solution\nby the smooth surface. This can lead to complete loss of the\nbloodstain pattern [63]. Particular care should therefore be used\nwhen dealing with these substrates, particularly when they are\nnon-horizontal, in order to avoid the loss of the stains. Investi-\ngators should ﬁrst use a minimum amount of luminol solution\nby rapidly spraying, preferably with a nebulizer, the suspected\narea, and avoiding further applications, quickly photograph the\nemission [51,63,73].\n3.2.2. Inﬂuence of interfering substances\nThere is a wide range of environmental and pharmaceuti-\ncal, domestic and industrial substances which are able to affect\nluminol blood-induced chemiluminescence. This may be due to\ncatalytic activity, their redox properties, or their chemical reac-\ntivity with the luminol mixture or with iron in the bloodstains.\nExamples of such chemicals are the components of several com-\nmonly occurring materials such as soils, detergents, bleaches,\ncarpet, metal objects, tools, plastic panels, wood, and vegetable\ncompounds.\nCompounds which may suppress luminol chemilumines-\ncence are summarised in Fig. 12. Ligands with an high\nafﬁnity/reactivity for a speciﬁc oxidation state of iron such\nas sulﬁde (ferryl ion ligand) or cyanide (ferric ion ligand) or\ncompounds acting as anti-oxidising species (standard reduc-\ntion potential, E0′ < E0′ luminol) such as ascorbate, phenolics,\nanilines and thiols [84], may act as molecular traps subtract-\ning either the catalyst (iron ions) or the reductant (luminol),\nFig. 12.

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13].

This seminal discovery has triggered a renewed decade-long search for the underlying\nphysics, in particular trying to pin down the role of air and the surface roughness (Tsai et al. 2009,\n2010, 2011). As discussed below, many proposals have appeared, but consensus has yet to emerge.\nThe interplay between the surface roughness and gas pressure complicates the interpretation of\nthe two splashing types. Xu et al. (2007) devised an ingenious way to study the size distribution of\nthe ejected droplets by simply surrounding the impact with a circular sheet of paper. The resulting\nsplatters showed different signatures for the two splashing types, with a thin horizontal line of\nspots for the prompt splash and a more vertically spread random distribution for the corona splash.\nHowever, this technique captured only forward-moving droplets and was limited to droplets larger\nthan 100 µm. Direct imaging of the splashed droplets in the prompt splash regime showed that\nthe earliest droplets are the smallest and emerge at the highest velocities, with early 5-µm droplets\nemerging at close to 90 m/s, or 104 times their terminal velocity (Thoroddsen et al. 2012) (see\nSupplemental Video 1). They are therefore rapidly decelerated by air drag and can easily become\nairborne. These observed droplet sizes support viscous growth of the thickness of the early lamella.\nXu et al. (2007) proposed that the prompt splash is produced by the surface roughness, whereas\nthe corona splash is created by the air drag at the front of the lamella. This cannot be the whole\nstory, as prompt microsplashing has been observed by Thoroddsen et al. (2012) for an impact\non a smooth glass surface. Latka et al. (2012) proposed that perhaps a single mechanism is at\nplay, simply appearing at different spreading locations. They removed the inﬂuence of the corona\nsplash by conducting the experiments in a low-pressure helium atmosphere, clearly showing that\na random surface roughness can reduce splashing by reducing the levitated ﬁlm at the edge of the\nexpanding lamella, while increasing prompt splashing.\nStevens et al. (2014) found an empirical scaling for the splashing boundary on a smooth surface\nusing low-viscosity liquids over a range of gas pressures. The scaling highlights the importance of\nthe mean-free path of the gas molecules.\nA few studies have looked at splashing on inclined surfaces (Stow & Hadﬁeld 1981) or rapidly\ntranslating surfaces. Chou et al. (2009) showed strong asymmetry and splashing even in the low–\nWeber number deposition regime, when the impact angle to the vertical direction exceeds 85◦.\nBird et al. (2009) additionally showed that the corona splash can be suppressed on the lamellar\nstretching side for a very large translational velocity of the substrate.\n4.3. Levitated Lamella\nThe drop viscosity dramatically changes the splashing dynamics. For more viscous liquids, the\nlamella lifts away from the substrate (Driscoll et al. 2010, Schroll et al. 2010) and starts gliding\non a thin sheet of air (Figure 6a). The forces responsible for the levitation of the sheet must arise\nfrom the dynamics around the rapidly moving contact line. Lubrication in the air under the sheet\nrequires a large advancing contact angle, whereas suction in the airﬂow over the top is an inertial\nprocess. Bischofberger et al. (2013) introduced glycerin vapor into the air, forming spectacular\nSchlieren images (Figure 6c), to identify vortices forming above the leading edge of the lamella.\nThoroddsen et al. (2010) showed that this levitated lamella can become unstable and can touch\nthe solid surface ahead of the contact line, thus not only entrapping a myriad of air bubbles\nwhen these localized contacts meet the expanding contact line (Figure 6d ), but also rupturing\nthe levitated lamella, producing a powerful capillary-driven splash. This bubble entrapment was\nstudied in more detail by Driscoll et al. (2010) and Palacios et al. (2012), who observed multiple\nrings of microbubbles. The earliest breakup of the lamellar edge may be assisted by capillary\ninstability in the cusp in the neck at which the lamella connects to the drop (Figure 6b and\nSupplemental Video 2) or by sawtooth instability at the contact line (Rein & Delplanque 2008).\nwww.annualreviews.org • Drop Impact\n377\nSupplemental Material"

Readers are also referred to\nSupplemental Videos 7–10.\nStevens et al. (2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using\nlarger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can\nobscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).\nBlood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nLaan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can\nhelp pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).\nThe splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability\nof the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,\nthe easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical\nS-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in\nFigure 8.\n5. THE EFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE PROPERTIES\nAbove we focus on impacts on ﬂat dry surfaces. Allowing modiﬁcation of the substrate opens\nup uncountable variants. The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &\nBourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or\nspatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the\nmyriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during\nspray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new\nmicro- and nanofabrication techniques.\n380\nJosserand· Thoroddsen"

Results presented in this\nstudy have thus been obtained with a spatial resolution r = 5 cm,\nunless otherwise speciﬁed. Computing time varied linearly with\nthe volume of the space investigated, and was proportional to r\u00055.\nTypical reconstruction simulation times on a recent laptop (Intel I7\n2.4 GHz processor) took 20 min with r = 5 cm, and 25 s with r = 20\ncm. The latter resolution is adequate for investigative work,\nsuggesting that the method is suitable for real-time crime scene\nprocessing.\nTo further assess the capabilities of the reconstruction method,\narbitrary spatter patterns have been numerically generated using\ngeometrical intersections between the tangents to prescribed\ncircles and the walls of a room. The prescribed swings (in black)\nand the corresponding reconstruction are in Fig. 11. It appears that\nthe reconstruction method can help distinguishing multiple\nswings from each other, such as circular swings in parallel planes\n(a) or in intersecting planes (b); The method is also able to\nreconstruct cast-off patterns where \nthe swing \nhas \nvarious\norientations with respect to the vertical plane (b).\n6. Implications for crime scene reconstruction\nThis work provides a new tool to process crime scenes involving\nlinear spatter patterns characteristic of cast-off events. The\nproposed tool can handle stains located on four perpendicular\nsurfaces such as the walls of a room. The reconstruction results are\nprovided with an uncertainty that is speciﬁc to the spatter pattern\nat hand. Best reconstruction results are produced using all the\navailable stains, independently of size or ellipticity (see section\n3.2). While round stains are usually avoided for area of origin\ndeterminations, since they imply large directional uncertainty\n[12], the proposed method automatically associates less weight to\nreconstructed arcs associated with round stains. According to the\ntrade-off between uncertainty and error presented in Fig. 9,\nlikelihood values ranging from 60 \n L < 90% are recommended for\ninvestigative work. Spatial resolution of r = 20 cm or less and\npictures with less than 0.1 mm uncertainty on stain size are\nrecommended for investigative work.\nWhile the current model can be applied to investigative work on\ncurrent and historical forensic cases, there is room for future work.\nFirst, the presented method assumes straight-line trajectories of the\ndrops. While this assumption can cause signiﬁcant errors in the\nreconstruction of impact spatter patterns (which can be generated by\ndrops with wide range of sizes and initial velocities), it is not clear at\npresent how much errorin cast-off reconstruction occurs byassuming\nstraight trajectories. Possibly, the generation mechanism of cast-off is\ndifferent than impact spatter patterns and may produce different\ndistributions of drops sizes and velocities, that may be less subject to\ndeviation by drag and gravity. This hypothesis, as well as any\nmodiﬁcation of the method to address the curvature of the trajectories\nby gravity is however a topic of further studies. What is currently\nknown is that reconstruction uncertainties associated with drag and\ngravity strongly depend on the distance between wall and origin,\nincreasingwithapowerofaboutﬁveof thatdistance[18].Forexample,\none reviewerwhotested the accompanying software mentioned large\nerrors (more than two meters) for a case where a set of stains made on\ntwo opposite walls, 5 m apart, were used to reconstruct a cast-off\npattern. Thus, analysts should be wary of reconstruction results where\nthe reconstructed swing or area of origin are not close to the wall, a\nﬁnding supported by experiments in [14]. This recommendation is\nespecially important for evaluative statements made during court\ntestimony. Furtherstudies mayalsoextendthesoftwarecapabilitiesto\nhandle stains on walls of arbitrary orientations, which will require\nmodiﬁcations to the data structure of the software. Handling stains on\nwalls of different materials may also require to have individual\nmeasurement errors for each stain. It is also the ﬁrst time that the\nauthors propose a new reconstruction method as an open-source\nsoftware, with the hope that forensic researchers will use it and\nprovide feedback and input for future development.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this manuscript, a method to reconstruct the motion, or\nswing, of a weapon generating cast-off stains has been proposed,\nbased on stain inspection and Euclidean geometry. Agreement\nbetween measured and reconstructed swings is characterized in\nterms of error and uncertainty. For a series of six human-created\ncast-off patterns, a trade-off is identiﬁed between the amount of\nuncertainty and the magnitude of the error, which can be\ncontrolled by selecting the likelihood value. Error was found to\nbe zero for likelihood values 60% or smaller. The reconstruction\nFig. 11. Ability of the algorithm to reconstruct spatter patterns produced by more than one cast-off swing event.

Bonn*,†\n†Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute, Institute of Physics, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH Amsterdam,\nNetherlands\n‡Netherlands Forensic Institute, Laan van Ypenburg 6, 2497 GB The Hague, Netherlands\nABSTRACT: We investigate the impact velocity beyond which the ejection\nof smaller droplets from the main droplet (splashing) occurs for droplets of\ndiﬀerent liquids impacting diﬀerent smooth surfaces. We examine its\ndependence on the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension.\nWe show that the splashing velocity is independent of the wetting properties\nof the surface but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of\nthe liquid. A preexisting splashing model and simpliﬁcation are considered\nthat predict the splashing velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. Both the splashing model and simpliﬁcation give a good\nprediction of the splashing velocity for each surface and liquid, demonstrating the robustness of the splashing model. We also\nshow that the splashing model can also predict the splashing velocity of blood, a shear-thinning ﬂuid.\n■INTRODUCTION\nWhen impacting a dry, smooth surface, a droplet either spreads\nover the surface (for low-impact velocities) or disintegrates\ninto smaller droplets (for high-impact velocities). This so-\ncalled splashing phenomenon has been the subject of\nnumerous studies over the last several decades and is of\nrelevance for a wide range of practical applications such as crop\nspraying,1,2 rain drops impacting porous stones,3,4 and forensic\nresearch.5−7 The splashing velocity vsp is deﬁned as the critical\nvalue of the impact velocity of the droplet beyond which\nsplashing occurs (Figure 1). Many studies have tried to ﬁnd an\nempirical relation between the splashing velocity and ﬂuid\nparameters8−13 and between the splashing velocity and surface\nproperties.14−17 In addition, Xu et al.18 showed that the\natmospheric conditions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on droplet\nsplashing,13,17,19 implying that the air viscosity is also an\nimportant parameter. To include the air viscosity, Riboux and\nGordillo recently proposed a theoretical model for impact and\nsplashing on smooth surfaces.20 They postulated that splashing\noccurs because of the breakup of a small liquid ﬁlm that lifts oﬀ\nthe surface just after the impact due to the lift force generated\nby the surrounding air. In the model, the ﬂuid and substrate\nproperties govern the splashing as well as the air viscosity; in\nref 20, a quantitative agreement was found between the model\nand experiments on a single substrate.\nNumerous experimental studies have investigated splash-\ning;8−19 however, the inﬂuence of the wetting properties of the\nsurface on splashing has not been considered in detail. It has\nrecently been shown that the wetting properties of the surface\naﬀect droplet spreading at low-impact velocities.21,22 In the\nmodel of Riboux and Gordillo, the splashing velocity also\ndepends on the surface properties.20 The surface tension and\nthe wetting properties of the surface are closely linked through\nYoung’s law.23 Therefore, the dependence of the splashing\nvelocity on surface tension should also be taken into account\nfor a droplet of a given size. Furthermore, the splashing model\nhas not yet been tested for more complex ﬂuids such as, for\nexample, blood. In forensics, being able to determine when\nblood splashes could help in distinguishing between the stains\nthat are formed from the droplet impact (impact stain) or the\nstains formed by absorbing blood during contact with a blood\nsource (transfer stain).7,24 Blood is a shear-thinning ﬂuid, but\nstudies have shown that blood can be approximated as a\nNewtonian ﬂuid when it is subjected to high shear rates.25−27\nLaan et al. showed in 2014 that the spreading of blood is\nsimilar to the spreading of Newtonian ﬂuids, which was\nattributed to the high shear rate inside the droplet during\nspreading.21 As splashing occurs during spreading (Figure 1b),\nthe questions are whether blood can also be approximated as a\nNewtonian ﬂuid during splashing and whether the splashing\nvelocity of blood can also be predicted using the splashing\nmodel for Newtonian ﬂuids of ref 20.\nIn this paper, we systematically investigate the eﬀect of\nsurface tension of the liquid and the wetting properties of the\nsurface on the splashing velocity of the droplet.

    "text_chunk": "(Fig. 4B). The theoretical model is able to predict not only the\nscaling trend in the data, but also the prefactor; both exper-\niment and model indicate that ∼1% of the available heat is\nexchanged during the bounce of a millimeter-sized water drop\non a superhydrophobic-coated glass substrate. Additionally, as\nthe spreading factor rm/R is increased, holding the other param-\neters constant, the amount of heat transferred increases as well,\nas predicted in the model.\nReturning to the two potential models proposed earlier, the\ndirect-contact model depends on the substrate thermal proper-\nties, whereas the air-cushion model does not. Speciﬁcally, the\nmodel predicts that less heat would be exchanged by the bounc-\ning water drop if the glass substrate were replaced by more insu-\nlating materials, such as synthetic rubber (M = 2.6) or natural\nwood (M = 4.2). To test this prediction, we repeat the experi-\nmental procedure with neoprene rubber and pine wood instead\nof glass. The measured thermal properties of these materials are\nprovided in Table S1. A thin superhydrophobic layer of soot is\ncoated on the rubber and wood substrates following the same pro-\ncedure used for the glass substrate. Thus, the superhydrophobic\nsurfaces in all samples were identical, whereas the underlying sub-\nstrates differed. Experimental data for heated water drops bounc-\ning on the rubber (square symbols) and wood (circle symbols) are\nplotted along with the theoretical predictions (Fig. 4B). The\nresults conﬁrm that the substrate material—even under a layer\nof soot—affects the amount of heat exchanged Q during the drop\nbounce, providing evidence for the direct-contact model.\nAn interesting feature of the direct-contact model is that,\ncounterintuitively, a smaller drop can transfer a larger fraction\nof its potential heat than a larger drop even though the smaller\ndrop is in contact with the surface for less time (Fig. 4B). This\nresult is a consequence of the self-similar conductive heat trans-\nfer into the drop and substrate. Indeed, the opposite trend—\nlarger drops transferring a larger fraction of potential heat—\nwould be expected if the heat transfer was regulated by a layer of\ntrapped gas with a ﬁxed depth. These trends are further compli-\ncated if the spreading factor rm/R also varies. Nevertheless, our\nﬁndings taken at a constant spreading factor (Fig. 4B) illustrate\nan important concept: Smaller drops may contact the surface for\na shorter time than larger drops, yet during this time, the smaller\ndrop encounters a larger average heat ﬂux from the self-similar\nconduction.\nCooling from Multiple Drops. Although the focus of this paper has\nbeen on the heat exchange of individual drops, most applications\ninvolve multiple drops. For example, many birds have feathers\nthat are superhydrophobic (7, 21); however, exposure to cold rain\ncan adversely cool a bird (34, 35) and in extreme cases has been\nlinked to hypothermia and death (36, 37).\nOur results measuring the small fraction of potential heat\nexchanged with a drop on a superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 4)\nsuggest that a solid body would be noticeably warmer throughout\na cold shower if drops rapidly bounced off the surface rather than\nbecoming stuck. Additionally, these results suggest that at the\nsame ﬂow rate, the bouncing of smaller drops would exchange\nmore heat than that of larger drops, provided that the spreading\nfactor for the smaller drops was similar to or greater than that of\nthe larger drops.\nTo evaluate these predictions, we measure the temperature T\non the underside of a suspended duck feather on top of which a\nsteady stream of drops impacts. These feathers (Fig. 5A) have\na barb and barbule microtexture (Fig. 5B) that enables their\nnatural superhydrophobicity. We compare identical experiments\non a feather that is superhydrophobic and a feather that has\nbeen made superhydrophilic through plasma irradiation (38) and\nindeed ﬁnd that the undersides of feathers are warmer when cold\ndroplets bounce rather than stick (Fig. S3).\nA superhydrophobic feather can also be used to explore\nthe extent that drop size might affect the amount of heat\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFig. 5.\nCooling from different-sized drops impacting at ambient tempera-\nture onto a warmed feather. (A) A photograph of a gray duck pennaceous\nfeather used in the experiments. (B) A scanning electron microscope image\nreveals the interlocking barb and barbule microtexture that is responsible\nfor the natural superhydrophobicity of the feather. (C) High-speed images\nshow the two different-sized streams of water drops at identical ﬂow rates\nbounce off of the top surface of the feather. (D) A heat map illustrates the\ntemperature underneath the warmed feather averaged over a 100-s period.\nDuring this period, the two streams of ambient-temperature water drops\nthat bounce on the top side of the feather lead, on the bottom side, to local\ncooling. The circles denote the location of the stream of large drops (left),\nthe stream of small drops (right), and a midpoint in which there are no drops\n(center). (E) The temperature within each of these circled regions is plotted\nfor 10 s before the start of the experiment, as well as 2 min during which\nthe drops steadily drip on the top side of the feather. Insets highlight the\nperiodicity of the temperature response on the side of the feather opposite\nto where the drops impact. Here the time between each falling water drop\nis 2 s for the large drops and 0.3 s for the small drops.\ntransferred. To explore this possibility, two streams of drops\nwere released simultaneously, one larger (R ≈2 mm) and\none smaller (R ≈1.1 mm), with identical ﬂow rates 1 mL/min\nand similar spreading factors rm/R ≈1.3 and 1.7, respec-\ntively (Fig. 5C). Here the drops were at the ambient lab-\noratory temperature 26 ◦C, whereas the feather was heated\nto 40 ◦C, the approximate body temperature of a bird (39)\n(Fig. S4).\nA time-averaged thermal image from below the feather (Fig.\n5D) reveals that the regions under which the large and small\ndrops fall are indeed cooler than the surrounding regions, even\nthough the drops are the same temperature as the ambient air\non the top side of the feather. The locations under which the\ndrops fall, as well the midpoint between these two locations,\nare denoted with black circles in Fig. 5D. The average temper-\nature within these circled regions varies with time (Fig. 5E).\nBefore the experiment begins (t < 0), the temperature within\nthese three regions is indistinguishable. As drops bounce off the\nfeather, the midpoint temperature remains steady whereas the\ntemperature on the opposite side from where the drops fall cools.\nThese temperatures ﬂuctuate, with the region associated with the\nsmaller drop having a lower average temperature than that of the\nlarger drop.\n6934\n|\nwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1700197114\nShiri and Bird\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 92.30.172.63 on June 24, 2025 from IP address 92.30.172.63."

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used. A \nconsiderably \nhigher percentage of such findings \nwas reported by Fraenckel and"

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

When the stain\nsize is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the\ncorrelation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-\nsional number against a nondimensional number.\nThe circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-\nmeterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the\nstain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain\ndiameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as\nb (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape\n(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both\nthe stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4.

The gas cushions the initial contact; it\nis entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the\nso-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid.

Iron binding molecules in blood: (Panel A) heme molecular structure in oxyhemoglobin with iron in reduced form (Fe2+) coordinated by O2 in the sixth\ncoordination position (deoxyhemoglobin has no ligands in this position), and by a histidine on the globin for the ﬁfth coordination position; (Panel B) hematin\nmolecular structure with iron in oxidised form (Fe3+) bonding a hydroxide ion (with the histidine and, more generally, the entire globinic portion usually lost).\nresponsible for the red colour of blood. Mammalian hemoglobin\nis a tetrameric hemoprotein composed of four protein portions,\nnamed globins each enclosing a prosthetic heme group, consist-\ning of a protoporphyrin IX–Fe2+ coordination complex (Fig. 6,\nPanel A) [49]. The ferrous ion is bound in the middle of the\nprotoporphyrin IX ring by the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms. Of\nthe remaining two axial coordination sites, above and below the\nplanar ring of the porphyrin, one is occupied by a histidine on\nthe globin (ﬁfth coordination position) while the second axial\nposition (sixth coordination position) is available for an exoge-\nnous ligand which, in the case of oxyhemoglobin is O2 (while\nno ligand is present in this position in deoxyhemoglobin).\nWithin the body human hemoglobin is protected against\ndenaturation by encapsulation in red blood cells and iron ions\nare kept in the ferrous state by several mechanisms, both\nnon-enzymatic (globin envelope prevents Fe2+ oxidation and\nerythrocytes reduced glutathione reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+) and\nenzymatic (mainly NADPH-MetHb reductase and NADH cyt b5\nreductase of the erythrocytes catalyze Fe3+ reduction to Fe2+)\nso that methemoglobin (MetHb) formation is hampered [50].\nHence, the valence of iron is kept the same upon bonding with\noxygen (oxygenation) or losing oxygen (deoxygenation).\nOnce outside the organism and deposited on a substrate,\nblood is subjected to a series of degradation processes [10]\nin which most erythrocytes undergo hemolysis and biological\nmolecules are involved in hydrolytic and/or oxidoreductive reac-\ntions primarily catalyzed from their own intracellular enzymes\n(e.g. aseptic autolysis due to catepsins released from dead cells\nlysosomes), or from enzymes of microorganisms populating the\nexternal environment. Degradation of the polypeptidic portion\nof hemoglobin takes place, the histidine coordinating the iron ion\nis generally lost, and spontaneous oxidation of the Fe2+ ion con-\ntained in the tetrapyrrolic ring of heme prosthetic group to Fe3+\nion rapidly occurs since, in this condition, cellular iron reduction\nprocesses lack [16,51–53]. If alkaline conditions are present, the\nFe3+ is coordinatinated by a hydroxyl group ( OH−). The heme\nprosthetic group containing ferric rather than ferrous iron, with\nthe O2 being replaced by the hydroxyl group, is named hematin\n(ferric protoporphyrin hydroxide) (Fig. 6, Panel B) and, corre-\nspondingly, the bloodstain shows a chromatic change from a\ntypically red colour to a tawny-brown [49,53]. The processes of\nloss of the polypeptidic shells of hemoglobin and conversion of\nheme prosthetic group into hematin are increased when a lumi-\nnol preparation is sprayed onto the bloodstain due to both the\npresence of an oxidant and the alkaline environment.\nWhen a luminol formulation is applied on a bloodstain, fer-\nric heme groups are able to catalyze both the decomposition\nreaction of peroxide and the oxidation of luminol and other\nsubstrates by peroxide [54–57]. These reactions are thought\nto be allowed by the ability of the hydroxy-ferric-porphyrin\n(OH-Fe3+-P) hematin group to undergo a two-electron oxidation\nto a hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin radical (OH-Fe4+-P•) (analogous\nto Compound I in enzymes peroxidases, although the radi-\ncal centre can then translocate to the globin), which can then\nreturn to the ferric porphyrin hematin state in two one-electron\nreduction steps via the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin (OH-Fe4+-P)\nhematin group (analogous to Compound II in enzymes peroxi-\ndases) (Fig. 7) [13,19,57–59]. The catalytic process thus cycles\nbetween these three oxidation states of the hemoglobin, with the\nstable resting state being the ferric hematin. Alternative catalytic\ncycles and oxidising species have been proposed (e.g. see Thorn-\nton and Maloney [13]), but the above cycle is now accepted by\nthe majority of researchers [57,60].\nAs these ferric heme derivatives show the same catalytic\nproperties and capability of participating in two-electron redox\ncycles as a group of enzymes called peroxidases widely dis-\ntributed especially in vegetables, their activity is termed a\npseudo-peroxidase or peroxidase-like. This activity is com-"

The method \ngenerates metrics relating to the individual stains as well as the overall pattern, including bloodstain pattern \nspecific metrics such as the gamma angle, circularity, solidity, area of convergence, stain density and pattern \nlinearity. This method provides an objective approach to the analysis of bloodstains and bloodstain patterns and \ncan generate a wealth of quantitative data that is currently not obtainable using manual techniques or other \nimage-based programs currently utilised in the discipline. This method will be useful to analysts and researchers \ninvestigating the application of quantitative methods to bloodstain pattern analysis.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is a discipline of forensic science \nthat is concerned with the study of the size, shape and distribution of \nbloodstains deposited onto surfaces at bloodletting events, particularly \ncrime scenes. With knowledge of the underlying principles of fluid \nmechanics, the physical characteristics of the stains can be analysed and \nused to assist with the reconstruction of the events that led to the \nbloodshed [1–3]. One of the key tasks in BPA is the classification of \nspatter patterns. Spatter patterns are groups of small circular and \nelliptical shaped bloodstains that have been formed as the result of some \nexternal force being applied to a source of liquid blood [4]. The current \nterminology of the different classes of spatter patterns in BPA relate to \nthe mechanism of the force that caused them. Common types of spatter \npatterns present at crime scenes include impact (caused by an object \nstriking liquid blood), swing cast-off (caused by blood released from a \nbloodstained object due to its swinging motion), and expirated (caused \nby the generation of droplets due to the force involved with the expul­\nsion of blood from the mouth, nose or lungs) [4]. The application of \nthese forces on the liquid blood results in its breakup into smaller \ndroplets that travel through the air away from the blood source. When \nthese predominately spherical droplets land onto nearby surfaces they \ncollapse and spread on the target forming circular and elliptical shaped \nbloodstains.\nBPA can be a valuable tool in investigations; however, the subjec­\ntivity of the discipline has been criticised [5,6] and disagreements be­\ntween trained analysts have been documented in some high-profile cases \n[7,8]. A lack of empirical data and scientific foundations was cited as \nareas needed for improvement [5]. These criticisms have raised doubt \nover the reliability of the evidence that is often delivered in courtrooms. \nIn response, reliability and black box studies have been undertaken to \ninvestigate the accuracy and reliability of bloodstain pattern classifica­\ntion. These studies have shown that some spatter patterns can have high \nerror rates for classification [9–11]. This is not unsurprising as the me­\nchanical process involved in the formation of spatter stains is the same \nregardless of the initial force applied. As a result, there are overlapping \ncharacteristics between different types of spatter patterns (for example, \nthe range of stain sizes in a pattern) which can lead to ambiguity or \nmisclassification. Studies have also shown some analysts are not always \nconsistent with their classifications, classifying the same pattern \ndifferently when unknowingly presented with it a second time [12]. The \ninference being that there is a subjective approach to the classification \nprocess. There have been calls for more systematic guidelines within the \ndiscipline to assist with the classification task, but currently there is still \nno agreed criteria about what features are required to make a classifi­\ncation and the decision is left to the analyst based on their training, \nexperience and level of confidence.\nTo reduce the subjectivity, quantitative methods have been \n* Correspondence to: 27 Creyke Road, Ilam, Christchurch 8041, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: rosalyn.rough@esr.cri.nz (R.

The number of spots in each run, thus\nranked for sound level, is given in Fig. 4.\n3.2. Mouthing sounds and words in the upright seated posture\nthrough a bloody mouth\nThe number of spots of blood captured on the target for each\nrun is shown in Table 1. On average, each ‘P’ produced 271\ncaptured spots of which 2 were more than 1 mm dia.; each ‘S’\nproduced 313 captured spots of which 4 were more than 1 mm dia.\nFor the 10 ‘P’ runs, a total of 2060 spots were recorded including 16\nlarge spots – that is 1 large spot per 128 small spots. For the ‘S’ runs,\nthere were 43 large spots in a total of 3196 – that is 1 large spot per\n73 small spots.\nNote that the quiet ‘P’ sounds, used in the experiments with\nblood, were associated with rapidly developed peak pressures\n(Fig. 5) of less than 15 mm Hg; moderate sounds involved peak\npressures of around 25 mm Hg and the loudest ones were\nassociated with peak pressures of less than 35 mm Hg. In all cases\nthe manoeuvre was effectively impulsive, lasting for approx. 1 s,\nand pressure fell rapidly at the end.\nThe pressure recordings for an ‘S’ were of a different shape\n(Fig. 6), with an initial rapid rise to the peak value followed by a\nprogressive fall through the remainder of the manoeuvre as the\nsound was released and sustained.

Dependency of the number of cracks in the corona on the external diameter of\nthe drop (blood coming from the same tube taken from a healthy subject; microscope glass\nsubstrate; room temperature, 22◦C; humidity, 47 %).\nthrough RBC motion is noticeable. RBCs accumulate at the edge of the drop. When\nthe desiccation phenomenon occurs on the glass substrate, a decrease in volume is\nobserved due to the large amount of water required. During the desiccation process,\nstress inside the solid deposit of desiccated blood built up and induced surface cracks\nperiodically releasing the stress. Furthermore, the RBCs present at their surface\nproteins induce a hydrophobic behaviour with all materials. This is observed with\nglass. The dried RBCs at this position in the drop do not wet the substrate and\nreveal an hydrophobic behaviour. This enables a cracking phenomenon linked with\nthe diameter of the drop, and consequently with the perimeter of the corona. For\nsmall drop perimeters, the stress inside the RBCs solid deposit is small compared\nwith large drop diameters.\n5. Concluding remarks\nObservations of the Marangoni ﬂow motion inside a drop of blood using a digital\ncamera at a good resolution (about 2.3 µm) enable us to show that the motion of\nRBCs at the edge of the drop is the main mechanism of blood drop evaporation and\ndeposition. The mechanisms involved in the blood drop evaporation are conﬁrmed\nthrough the evaporation mass ﬂux which is measured to be in agreement with a\npure water drop evaporation. Other biological elements (white blood cells, proteins)\nare transported to the edge of the drop with the RBCs and contribute to the\npattern formation through the deposit wettability with the substrate and mechanical\nproperties. The blood evaporation dynamic can be predicted by a comparison with\nthe pure ﬂuid evaporation case corrected by the mass concentration in colloids.\nTotally diﬀerent patterns are formed according to whether the person is healthy or\nsuﬀers from anaemia or hyperlipidaemia. This is leading our research to correlate the\npattern formation with blood diseases.

(2006b).\nspreading dynamics are an important aspect in many applications, for instance, for inkjet printing\nin microelectronics (Minemawari et al. 2011) or in forensic science (Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,\nAttinger et al. 2013, Laan et al. 2014). In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

Readers are also referred to\nSupplemental Videos 7–10.\nStevens et al. (2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the\ntip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed\nthis time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance\nof the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip\nfrom the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence\nof the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low\nviscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately\nat a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel\net al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).\n4.4. Recent Theories\nRiboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for\nan impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized\nwetted area as r =\n√\n3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =\n\t\n3/t. They proposed that the\nliftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact\nline (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow\nover the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on\nthe contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical\nmodels involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner\n378\nJosserand· Thoroddsen\nSupplemental Material"

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

The latter devices work by the action of high pressure on\nthe rear of the projectile acting to accelerate it, pushing it along the\ntube without signiﬁcant leakage of the propellant gas or air around\nthe sides of the projectile. The acceleration is continually high\nthroughout the length of the barrel, not diminishing signiﬁcantly\nas the projectile increases speed.\n4.4. The ﬂight characteristics of spherical drops ﬁred into still air\nA droplet or particle allowed to fall in still air will speed up from\nrest in its downward motion due to the force of gravity causing it to\naccelerate. However, as the droplet moves through the surround-\ning air, it will experience viscous drag forces acting to slow it down\nin the manner described by Stokes’ Law. Ultimately, it will reach a\nmathematically predictable constant vertical terminal settling\nvelocity when the drag and gravitational forces balance.\nVery small droplets (0.01 mm diameter, typical of a water\nfog)\nhave\nan\nexceedingly\nsmall\nterminal\nsettling\nvelocity\n(3 \u0003 10\u00023 m s\u00021). For progressively larger droplets of increasing\nmass to surface area ratio, the terminal velocity increases rapidly\nwith size. Droplets of 0.1 mm dia. (typical of a mist), whilst still\nstrongly dominated by the viscous effects of the air, have a settling\nvelocity of the order of 0.3 m s\u00021. 1.0 mm drops (small rain drops)\nhave a far higher settling velocity of around 30 m s\u00021; their\naerodynamic behaviour is somewhat different from the smaller\nones and they are less vulnerable to any environmental airﬂow\ndisturbances.\nThe ﬂight characteristics of spherical drops ﬁred impulsively\ninto still air, rather than simply dropped, also may be calculated\nusing well established mathematical ballistic descriptions of their\nbehaviour. The ﬂight behaviour of spherical, unit density, droplets\nof a range of size ﬁred into still air at an initial velocity of 5 m s\u00021 at\nangles of 08, 308 or 458 to the horizontal, assuming the viscous drag\nforce to be described by the classical Stokes’ Law are illustrated in\nFig. 10a and b. The initial trajectory of 458 was chosen as this is very\nclose to the ideal angle to achieve the maximum horizontal ﬂight\ndistance of a large drop; greater or lesser angles produce ﬂight\npaths of shorter range measured along the horizontal at the level of\nﬁring.\n1.0 mm dia. droplets follow a near parabolic trajectory (Fig. 10a)\nbecause their motion is dominated by the effects of gravity; they\ncan cover signiﬁcant horizontal ranges and also reach signiﬁcant\nheights. Their behaviour is near to that of the traditional cricket\nball ﬂight.\nDroplets less than approx. 0.5 mm dia. behave very differently\nfrom larger ones. Their ﬂight is progressively attenuated because of\nthe dominant viscous effects and they travel only very small\ndistances from the point of ejection. As these droplets reach the\nlimit of their forward motion, they settle out reaching their\nterminal velocity in due course. The horizontal distance reached by\n0.1 mm drops, when ﬁred at 5 m s\u00021, is around 10–12 cm whilst\nthe vertical travel is less than 8 cm (Fig. 10b). Furthermore,\napparently paradoxically, small droplets ﬁred upwards at 308\ntravel further horizontally than those at 458; this is because they\nare not being slowed down as much by drag due to their vertical\nmotion.\nThe level of drag exerted on a spherical particle with increasing\nvelocity appropriately scaled as the Reynolds number (Re) is very\nwell known (see for example Ref. [17]). Stokes’ Law adequately\ndeﬁnes the viscous drag on spherical drops or particles travelling at\nspeeds where the appropriate velocity scaling, or Re, is less than\napprox. 1. As Re increases, so the drag law changes through the\nintermediate region (for Re in the range of approx. 1–103) to\nNewton’s Law for Re in the range 103–105 and the drag is more\nthan would be expected on the basis of Stokes’ Law, with the\ndroplet being slowed down more quickly and in a shorter distance\nthan indicated in the trajectories in Fig. 10a. In the circumstances\nof present interest, drops may be travelling at speeds governed by\ndiffering laws at various stages of their ﬂight (thus, for 1.0 mm\ndrops projected at an initial velocity of 5 m s\u00021, the initial\nRe = \u0004350; at the same ejection speed, 0.1 mm drops would have\n[(Fig._9)TD$FIG]\nFig. 9.

This resulted in complete separation of the blood\ndroplet from the needle and subsequent disintegration into smaller\ndroplets. A FastCam-Ultima 1024 high-speed video camera (Pho-\ntron, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture the disintegration of drop-\nlets from the syringe needle at 1000 frames per second. The\ncamera was positioned 0.5 m from the droplet such that it could\ncapture disintegration from a side view. A light source was placed\n1.5 m from the droplet on the opposite side to optimize image con-\ntrast. The camera was connected to the pulse generator to synchro-\nnize image capture with air release from the nozzle.\nThe initial velocity of projected droplets was obtained by mea-\nsuring the distance traveled by individual droplets between each\nframe of the high-speed camera images. The known needle diame-\nter was used for calibration. The resulting blood spatter pattern was\ncaptured on standard white printing paper positioned 86 mm below\nthe nozzle. The AO xy-coordinate was marked on the paper prior\nto each experimental run by releasing a single droplet from the\nneedle and allowing it to impact on the paper. Bloodstains were\nallowed to dry prior to digital conversion via a high-resolution\nscanner. All digital measurements were conducted using either the\nImageJ (U.S. National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Adobe\nIllustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA) imaging software.\nThe experiment was conducted using two different needle sizes\n(to vary droplet diameter) and four different air pressures (to vary\nimpact velocity). Each experiment was replicated three times,\nresulting in the generation of 24 blood spatter patterns. Where\napplicable, data comparison was undertaken using Neyman–Pearson\nstatistical testing with a 95% confidence interval.\nResults and Discussion\nFigures 3 and 4 show a side-by-side comparison of two blood\ndroplets undergoing disintegration. The two columns represent dif-\nferent applied air pressures (20 and 40 kPa). Droplet diameter was\nkept constant at 3.2 mm. The images show the process of disinte-\ngration over 25 msec following the application of pressurized air\nonto the droplet for 0.1 msec.\nAt time zero, the droplets can be seen adhering to the needle tip,\nrepresenting the known AO. At 3 msec, the pressurized air has\nalready been applied and sheets, filaments, and individual droplets\ncan be seen radiating from the AO. At 5 msec, small droplets\nc. 0.5 mm in diameter are moving away from the AO at\nc. 6 m⁄sec. These are byproducts of the initial pressurized air\nflowing over the liquid surface, causing sufficient instability to pro-\nduce droplets of this size.\nAt 10 msec, the 40 kPa air pressure is associated with the gener-\nation of more droplets than the 20 kPa air pressure. At both pres-\nsures, a substantial volume of blood can still be observed close to\nthe AO. By 20 msec, this volume of blood has begun to stabilize\ninto droplets c. 1–1.5 mm in diameter traveling away from the AO\nat a relatively low velocity of c. 1 m⁄sec. By 25 msec, only larger\ndroplets and a few filaments remain.\nThe resulting 24 spatter patterns exhibited similar characteristics.\nFigure 5 represents a 0.2 · 0.2 m portion of one spatter pattern.\nEach spatter pattern was comprised of c. 200 stains covering an\narea of about 1.1 · 0.2 m.

As mentioned previously, as\nthe time scale of the spreading process is extremely small, droplet\nspreading is associated with high shear rates. Consequently, it is\nacceptable to employ the viscosity of blood at high shear rates[7];\nhere, the viscosity value at 2000 s\u00031 is used, as mentioned in\nTable 3. The corresponding correlations for the different targets are\nplotted in Fig. 5 and tabulated in Table 3.\nInspection of Fig. 5 reveals ﬁrst how much larger the spreading\nis on the glass target. At low impact velocities, the spread factor on\nglass is on average 25% larger than on the other targets. This might\nbe due to enhanced wetting on the glass, which has a signiﬁcantly\nlower contact angle than other targets, as shown in tabulated in\nTable 3. As the Ohnesorge number increases, i.e. as the ratio of\nimpact energy versus the work of resistance forces increases, the\nspread factor on the glass target becomes comparable with that on\nother targets, owing to the decreased inﬂuence of wetting forces on\nspreading[10].\nFig. 5 also demonstrates how spreading is inﬂuenced by the\nroughness, for a given surface. The spreading factor for the\nroughened aluminum and polycarbonate targets are lower than for\ntheir respective unaltered counterparts. These observations are\ncoherent with the observations in Patil et al. [28] and Hulse-Smith\net al. [7], where an increase in the surface roughness reduces\nspreading upon drop impact. The associated formation of spines\nobserved in [7] is attributed to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,\nwhich is encountered when a liquid-air interface is subjected to a\nsudden acceleration[7,29]. One question that arises is if the\nspreading factor as calculated by equation (10) remains constant\nbetween a few seconds after impact and the hours or days that\nseparate a crime from a thorough bloodstain pattern analysis.\nIndeed, Brutin et al. [14] recently reported a slow spreading of\nsessile blood drops on glass due to evaporation, until equilibrium is\nreached. However, such a spreading is not observed in our\nexperiments of impacting drops. For glass, the dried stain diameter\nmeasured 24 h after impact is approximately 2% smaller than the\ndiameter of the blood drop after 20 ms of impact. A similar\nvariation is observed for the other targets, where the dried stain\ndiameter is approximately 2–3% smaller than the blood drop\ndiameter after 20 ms of impact. This difference in spreading\nbehavior, between the observation of Brutin’s group, who used\nsessile drops spreading slowly, and our experiments, can be\nattributed to the enhanced inertial spreading of the drop on impact\nin our study, where the inertia of the impacting drops completely\noverpowers the surface forces and causes the drops to reach a\nmaximum spread within just 20 ms after impact. The spreading\ninduced by evaporative ﬂux observed in [14] is effective on a much\nlarger time scale (in the order of 1 s), hence, its effects are not\nobserved.\nBased on the data in Fig. 5, a question of high relevance to\nforensic arises as follows. For the purpose of trajectory reconstruction\nfrom inspection of stains, can we use a single spreading correlation\nindependently of the target material and conditions? Let us ﬁrst\nquantify the uncertainty on trajectory reconstruction induced by\nusing a one-size ﬁt all correlation, versus correlations speciﬁc to a\ngiven target. A way to study these effects is by analytical inspection\nof equation (11). For a given correlation (i.e., known values of a and\nb) and a known b (from known stain size and drop volume), the\nheight from which the drop is released can be predicted using\nequation (11). Assuming that drag does not affect the droplet\ntrajectory, the impact velocity of the drop can be given as:\nVi ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n2gh\np\n;\n(14)\nwhere, g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the predicted\ndrop release height. Using equation (14), equation (11) is\ntransformed into:\nb ¼ a 2ghr2d2\ni\nm2 Oh\n \n!b\n;\n(15)\nfrom which the drop release height h can be expressed as\nh ¼\nm\nﬃﬃﬃs\np\n2gp1:5d1:5\ni\nb\na\n\u0002 \u00031\nb\n:\n(16)\nTo ascertain the variation in the drop release height prediction\noriginating from variations in a and b, Dh can be written as:\nDh ¼ @h\n@a Da þ @h\n@b Db:\n(17)\nThe corresponding partial derivatives of equation (16) give:\nDh\nh ¼ \u0003Da\nab þ ln\na\nb\n\u0002 \u0003Db\nb2 :\n(18)\nTable 3\nExperimental correlations for different targets plotted in Fig.5.\nTarget\nContact\nangle (o)\nSurface\nroughness,\nRa(mm)\nCorrelation\nGlass\n16.1\n–\nb ¼ 0:8474ðRe2OhÞ\n0:1334\nAluminum mirror\n87.1\n0.32\nb ¼ 0:4285ðRe2OhÞ\n0:1934\nAluminum P600 grit\n62.2\n0.4\nb ¼ 0:3914ðRe2OhÞ\n0:1965\nCardstock\n96.8\n1.09\nb ¼ 0:4019ðRe2OhÞ\n0:1921\nPolycarbonate bare\n86.9\n0.22\nb ¼ 0:3428ðRe2OhÞ\n0:2118\nPolycarbonate P20 grit\n98.6\n4.5\nb ¼ 0:3954ðRe2OhÞ\n0:1912\n[(Fig._5)TD$FIG]\nFig. 5.

Splashing arises\nfrom the breakup of a ﬁne liquid sheet that is ejected radially along the sub-\nstrate. Bouncing and deposition depend crucially on the wetting properties\nof the substrate. In this review, we focus on recent experimental and theoret-\nical studies, which aim at unraveling the underlying physics, characterized\nby the delicate interplay of not only liquid inertia, viscosity, and surface ten-\nsion, but also the surrounding gas. The gas cushions the initial contact; it\nis entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the\nso-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid. Particular\nattention is paid to the inﬂuence of surface roughness, natural or engineered\nto enhance repellency, relevant in many applications.\n365\nClick here to view this article's\nonline features:\n \n• Download ﬁgures as PPT slides\n• Navigate linked references\n• Download citations\n• Explore related articles\n• Search keywords\nANNUAL \nREVIEWS\n \nFurther"

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

This resulted in the\naverage upper angles of the close-to-cone domain in which\ndroplets are issued for the forward and backward spatter of 27 \u0001 9\u0003\nand 57 \u0001 7\u0003, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-\ncone domain are 28 \u0001 12\u0003 and 30 \u0001 18\u0003, respectively. The detailed\ninformation on these angles is given in Fig. 7, with the lower semi-\nangles shown as negative.\nFig. 7 shows that backward spattered droplets have a wider\nspread angle than the forward spattered ones. The bare sponge\nexperiments 7Aa1 and 7Ab1 revealed an almost symmetric upper\nand lower angles of the spatter domains in forward and backward\nspatter. Such symmetry is less prominent in the other experiments\nwhich indicates that covering a sponge with silicone or tape results\nin an uneven distribution of droplets. This is important because\nthe initial droplet cloud signiﬁcantly determines their further\ntrajectories and shows that the effect of victim’s clothes may be\ncrucial for crime scene reconstruction. It should be emphasized\nthat blood droplets were seen to form from the target periphery\nnot penetrated by the bullet and continued to be formed long after\nthe bullet left the target. The above-mentioned angles correspond\nto 0.5 ms after the bullet impact. However, they vary in time, albeit\nnot too much, i.e. staying close to the values shown in Fig. 7.\nThe effect of muzzle gases on the blood spattered droplets is\nmore pronounced in experiments where the distance between the\nmuzzle of the gun and target was short. An example of this is\nshown \nin \na \nhigh-speed \nvideo \nnot \nanalyzed \nabove, \nwhose\nexperiment number was 7Aa7 which was a .22 cal bullet impacting\na blood-impregnated sponge at 50 cm. Several frames of this video\nare shown in Fig. 8.\nWhile the motion of the muzzle gases is difﬁcult to discern in\nthe still images, it is clearly visible in the video. The effect of the\nmuzzle gases is the following: as time progresses, the droplets do\nnot only move outward from the surface of the sponge, but are also\nentrained by muzzle gases impinging onto the sponge and turn\ntowards the left, which is against gravity and against backward\nspatter motion. This phenomena has been discussed in literature\nbefore [29], and clearly should not be ignored.\nTwo more observations worth noting were made when viewing\nthe selection of MFRC videos. Both of them are revealed in the\nforward spattered section of experiment 7Db2, of which a series of\nfour video frames are shown in Fig. 9.\nFirst, note that the angle of the bullet coming out of the target is\nnot normal to the target face. The forward spattered droplets seem\nto follow the axis of penetration and as a result, they travel at a\ndownward angle of inclination. Note that this trend is opposite to\nwhat is seen for backward spattered droplets in Fig. 8. For that\nFig. 5. The number of droplets in the PIV region of interest for each experiment.

Accordingly, we tested our \nmethod on stains of a real impact pattern at the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) where we created \neight impact patterns (n =  8) from a distance of one meter. We show how accurate and precise we can \ndetermine the location of the origin by determining the curved trajectory of each bloodstain chosen by \na BPA expert.\nWe make a distinction between the Point of Origin (PO) and the Region of Origin (RO). The PO \nis the exact location given in x, y and z coordinates (PO(x, y, z)), which we calculated the pattern to \nbe originated from. The RO is defined as twice the standard deviation (SD) of the shortest distance \nbetween the PO and each trajectory (see supplementary materials). In Fig. 3 an example is shown of the \nanalysis of a typical impact pattern consisting of the straight-line approximation (red) and our method \nincluding gravity (green). The blue dot represents the location of the true origin. The spheres represent \nthe RO and the black dot in the middle of the spheres represents the PO. For this specific pattern 31 \nstains were analyzed (red dots). The true origin of all patterns was at a height of 63.7 cm, (true origin \nPOorigin(x, y, z) =  (100,150, 63.7) in cm). It is clear that the straight-line approximation overestimates \nthe point of origin height, zPO =  91.1 cm, which is an overestimation of 27.4 cm. With our method we \ndetermine the height to be 58.5 cm, which actually differs only by − 5.2 cm, which is almost one order \nof magnitude more accurate.

    "text_chunk": "ordinates between the centre of the stain and the furthest point away \nwere calculated with negative values indicating a left direction. For \nstains with left directionality, the gamma angle equates to the angle of \nthe stain plus 180 degrees.\nFor stains that are not particularly elliptical, determining a reliable \ndirectionality is difficult, if not impossible as tails and protrusions are \nusually not formed, and the leading edge of the stain cannot be identi­\nfied. Therefore, a threshold ratio of 0.86 was set (which equates to \napproximately 60-degree angle of impact) as stains made at impact \nangles above this do not usually display tails or protrusions. Thus, \ndirectionality was not calculated for stains which had a width to length \nratio greater than 0.86 to ensure only reliable directionality measure­\nments were calculated.\n3.5. Pattern metrics\nThree pattern metrics were selected for computation: linearity, \nconvergence and distribution of stains. The linearity was chosen as a \nmathematical representative of how linear or not a pattern was. It is \nexpected that patterns such as cast-off will have a more linear shape than \nradiating patterns from a stationary source of blood such as an impact, \nand therefore may be a useful measurement for discrimination. The \nlinearity was calculated by plotting all the stain centroids and fitting \nthem to a two-degree polynomial curve using numpy’s “polyfit” function \nwith an output graph [33].\nA small area of convergence in a pattern indicates that the stains \noriginated from a small area, suggesting a stationary source of blood, \nand is expected to be observed in impact patterns (and expirated pat­\nterns). To identify the area of convergence, a line following the major \naxis of the ellipse was extended back to the edge of the image for all \nstains with fitted ellipses. A sliding window algorithm over these line \nsegments found all of the intersections. A density matrix was calculated \nwith the Gaussian kernel density estimator described in [34] with 25 \nbins and then plotted using a heat map. A box was fitted around the area \nthat contained 60 % of the intersections and the co-ordinates of this box \nwere computed.\nA convex hull was applied to the entire pattern to calculate the total \narea of the pattern. The distribution of the stains was then calculated in \ntwo different ways, the first was simply the total number of stains \ndivided by the pattern area, and secondly, the total area of the stains \ndivided by the pattern area which gave a proportion of the pattern that \nwas stains.\n3.6. User interface\nA user interface was developed to increase usability of the applica­\ntion. This enables the user to select which annotations to display, which \npattern metrics to compute, and which results to export.\nThe user interface also enables the analyst to zoom in on a selected \nstain when the row representing that stain is selected, creating a link \nbetween the data and the selected stain. This allows the results to be \nchecked against the physical characteristics of the stain to ensure ac­\ncuracy. Batch processing was also made available so an entire folder of \nimages can be processed with no further user interaction.\n3.7. Outputs\nA digital image of a spatter pattern is used as the input along with the \nknown resolution of the image (in pixels per mm). The method delivers \nthe individual bloodstain metrics as a comma separated file (containing \none line for each stain and columns for each metric) and an annotated \nimage with selected features displayed. The overall pattern metrics are \ndelivered as a further comma separated file, and three graphs are pro­\nduced to display convergence, linearity and distribution of the stains. \nThe co-ordinates for all boundary pixels for each stains are also pro­\nduced in a separate comma separated file, with each row representing \nFig. 3.

The\nbackward spattered droplets are then issued normally to the face\nof the target, not in preference with the axis of the bullet as seen in\nforward spatter in Fig. 9.\nThe ﬁnal important observation in Fig. 9 is that the issued blood\ndroplets do not continue to travel as their initial trajectory would\ntend to suggest.

Pfeiffer\nInstitute of Legal Medicine, University of Mu¨nster, Ro¨ntgenstrasse 62, 48149 Mu¨nster, Germany\n1. Introduction\nReconstruction of the events from autopsy and scene ﬁndings is\none essential objective in death investigations. The presence of\nbloodstains at the crime scene can be of major importance for the\ninvestigation and reconstruction. In addition to haemogenetic\nindividualisation, the morphology and distribution of bloodstain\npatterns can provide vital information on the character, number\nand chain of events, which have caused the bloody scene. Before\nsuch interpretation of bloodstain patterns can be carried out\nreliably, the expert must have built up knowledge of and\nexperience in the types of stains and distributions, which may\nbe caused by various forms of injuries and mechanisms. In addition\nto systematic studies [1–4,6,8,9,10,11,13–18,20,21,23,26], case\nreports [5,12,22,24,27,28] may signiﬁcantly contribute to the\nvalidation\nof\nbloodstain\npattern\nanalyses,\nespecially\nif\nthe\nreconstruction is conﬁrmed by witnesses or perpetrators. This is\nwhy a series of illustrative case examples involving various\nbloodstain distribution patterns is presented where the mechan-\nism of production was veriﬁed by a confession of the offender. The\ncases originated from the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of\nMu¨nster, Germany, where crime scenes are regularly investigated.\n2. Case reports\n2.1. Case 1: arterial blood spatters originating from a corpse?\nA 23-year-old man was found dead near his car in some woods.\nThe missing head had been severed at the level of the 6th cervical\nvertebra, which showed 3 deep notches. Signs of severe anaemia\nwere obvious in the trunk of the body, but only a few bloodstains\nwere found inside the boot of the car. A suspect, who was soon\narrested, led the police to the site in the wood where he had buried\nthe head, which showed 2 intracranial gunshot wounds from a 5.6-\nmm rimﬁre riﬂe. The suspect claimed that he had performed the\ndecapitation with an axe in an aviary, after the victim was dead.\nThe crime scene investigation in the aviary (3 m \u0002 3 m) (Fig. 1a)\ntook place 5 days after the killing. On the left side of the door, the\nlower part of the wire netting showed abundant tiny blood\ndeposits and a large diagonal smear stain directed downwards.\nBelow these stains and covered by some sand, the soil was soaked\nwith blood over an area measuring 80 cm \u0002 25 cm and up to 20 cm\ndeep. A wooden beam at the bottom of the wire netting also\nshowed extensive red–brown discolouration from blood.

Contrary to experimental work, case reports where the reconstruction has\nbeen veriﬁed have rarely been published. This is the reason why a series of four illustrative cases is\npresented where bloodstain pattern analysis at the crime scene made a reconstruction of the events\npossible and where this reconstruction was later veriﬁed by a confession of the offender. The cases\ninclude various types of bloodstains such as contact and smear stains, drop stains, arterial blood spatter\nand splash stains from both impact and cast-off pattern. Problems frequently encountered in practical\ncasework are addressed, such as unfavourable environmental conditions or combinations of different\nbloodstain patterns. It is also demonstrated that the analysis of bloodstain morphology can support\nindividualisation of stains by directing the selection of a limited number of stains from a complex pattern\nfor DNA analysis. The complexity of real situations suggests a step-by-step approach starting with a\ncomprehensive view of the overall picture. This is followed by a differentiation and analysis of single\nbloodstain patterns and a search for informative details. It is ideal when the expert inspecting the crime\nscene has also performed the autopsy, but he deﬁnitely must have detailed knowledge of the injuries of\nthe deceased/injured and of the possible mechanisms of production.\n\u0002 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At 70 % of the total evaporation time, the central\narea of the drop starts to completely desiccate and evidences small-sized pattern\nformation.

This second dynamic is clearly related to the absence\nof convection, since the drop is now mainly a solid with a small amount of liquid\nremaining inside the red blood cells. The last stage of the drop evaporation consists of\nthe red blood cells shell cracking, which releases the haemoglobin.

The accuracy of drop\ndiameter determination for drop ﬂight videos was limited by image\nresolution, which amounted to 1 pixel size (or \n1 mm).\nThe velocity of the falling drops was observed to increase from\nabout 5–6 m/s at 2 m of fall to 8–9 m/s at 9 m. The time-dependent\nevolution of falling drop velocity for the larger drops studied was\nplotted in Fig. 6. Scatter of \n3–4 m/s observed in the raw data was\nassociated with an uncertainty in drop location (center of mass)\ndetermination from pixilated and thresholded images of \n5 m/s.\nDrop fall analogous to that studied experimentally was\nmodeled using the developed code. The experimentally measured\nblood drop size and density were used for computation. As the\nviscosity and surface tension of the blood were not measured,\npublished values of human blood viscosity of 4 mN s/m2 (at high\nshear rate) and surface tension of 62 mN/m ([35,37]) were used.8\nAll the models for drop deformation during ﬂight (based on\nGreen [28],[23] and TAB) performed well when predicting drop fall\nvelocity and consequently drop deformation levels which affect\ndrag force and drop trajectory (or velocity in the case of drop fall).\nNumerical velocity predictions were within 5% of the mean of the\nexperimental data.\nNumerical simulation for the case of a spherical blood drop (‘‘No\ndeformation’’ dataset) with a drag coefﬁcient dependent on\nReynolds number predicted higher drop velocities compared to\nthe \nmodels \nwith \ndrop \ndeformation, \nand \nhigher \nthan \nthe\nexperimental mean, although within the scatter of experimental\ndata. The discrepancy, however, was observed only for fall\ndistances higher than about 4 m.\nWhen the drag force was entirely neglected (‘‘No drag’’ dataset),\nthe predicted velocities deviated substantially from those of a\ndroplet experiencing drag by the time it had fallen 1.5 m. It is rare\nfor a passive blood drop to fall (vertically) much more than 1.5 m at\na crime scene. Such a short travel distance (and time of ﬂight)\nwould not allow a passive drop to experience any signiﬁcant drag\nforce effects and deformation to alter its ﬂight velocity (and thus,\nimpact velocity) under typical crime scene conditions.\n7.2.2. Initial oscillations of passive blood drops\nThe \nearly \nstage \nof \npassive \nblood \ndrop \nﬂight \nwas \nalso\nexperimentally and numerically studied. Initial oscillation ampli-\ntude and damping rate for drops falling up to 1.5 m were\ninvestigated.\nThe drops formed from the objects tested ranged from 1 to\n6 mm in diameter (see Table 3). Blood dripping from the\nhypodermic needle and kitchen knife generally produced uni-\nform-size drops (main or primary drops). For the case of a dripping\nhose connector and cylinder, the primary drop was followed by one\nor rarely two (or more) smaller droplets (termed ‘accompanying\ndrops’ or ‘satellite drops’). Initial oscillations of the needle, knife,\nhose connector and cylinder primary drops as well as uniform-\nsized hose connector satellite drops were investigated.\nThe primary drops were tracked as soon as the breakup from\nthe ligament was commenced and the body of a drop could be\ndifferentiated from the residual liquid adhering to the dripping\nsurface. Upon formation the drops experienced shape oscillations\nwith axisymmetric mode predominating.\nThe satellite drops studied were formed as a result of the break-\noff a highly elongated liquid ligament (length to width ratio of\nabout 10) from the residual liquid and its subsequent strong\ncontraction. The presence of a horizontal oscillation mode (see\n[42]) was noticed for the ﬁrst ten to ﬁfteen frames (or about 5 mm).\nThis may be attributed to the mode-coupling phenomena noted by\n[47].\nMost of the passive blood drops possessed a prolate shape upon\ndetachment, whereas the drops formed from the cylinder were\noblate (at the time of recognition).\nFig. 5.

Complexity will \nhence also encapsulate an inherent difficulty to transparently \nexplain and assess the process. As one reviewer aptly put \nit: “complexity is associated with the degree of uncertainty \none faces when assigning probabilities, so naturally, less data \nmore complexity.”\n2.\t The type of evaluative propositions\nApplications of LRs in the context of forensic expertise [20] \nare not only limited to evaluate the relation of the evidence \nwith either its source, but also to the associated activities, \nor the offense itself. These three types of propositions are \nwhat Cook et al. define as the hierarchy of propositions [35], \nexplaining that propositions of lower hierarchy (about source) \nare easier to weigh than higher ones (about activity or offense). \nThis hierarchy is reflected on the vertical axis of Figure 1.\nFor the first type of evaluative statement, source-­based evalua-\ntions, it is easier to apply LRs to material traces than patterns \n[36], because the material is of similar nature as the source \n(albeit in lower quantity), while patterns involve the printing of \nfeatures from the source to the evidentiary findings, a trans-\nfer process that is not always reproducible. As mentioned in \nRef. [37], “In case of crime scene markings created by one \nobject leaving markings of itself on another object—­such as \na fingerprint onto a surface, a firearm barrel onto a bullet, \nor teeth onto skin—­the faithfulness of the transfer from the \noriginal to the receiving surface, and the ability of the receiv-\ning surface to retain the impression unchanged, are essential \nto the probativeness of the comparison of the mark on the \nreceiving surface to a suspected source.”\nThe second type of evaluative statements where LRs are used \ninvolves activity propositions, where it is asked to consider \nthe meaning of the forensic observations in the context of \nthe activities that led to them. Evaluations of activity add to \nsource-­level considerations, the necessity to consider parameters \nsuch as the transfer and transport (how much material would \nbe exchanged under these alleged actions; how far from the \nsource would material be found), persistency over time (how \nthe material will potentially change, deteriorate, or disappear \nover time), the efficiency of the recovery methods used to \ncollect the traces, and the presence by chance of the material \nin the background [35]. Evaluations of activity do not only \naim at associating evidence to a source, but also, and often \nmainly, consider the spatial motion or temporal modification of \nthe evidentiary material. Examples are the assessment of DNA \nfindings considering either a direct or a secondary transfer \n[38] or the assessment of fibers [39] or glass [40] if a given \nset of actions occurred. Consideration of activity relies both \non databases of experimental cases and on models of the \ntransport, transfer, or persistence phenomena involved, be they \nphysical, chemical, or biological in nature. Again, the models \nneed to be validated against well-­designed and available data.\nThe third type of evaluations relates to judicial matters such as \nthe committed offense, which involve, in general, considerations \noutside the domain of expertise of the forensic expert [35].\nTherefore, Figure 1 represents the increasing difficulties associ-\nated with the different methods and propositions evaluated with \nLRs. The difficulties increase along the diagonal direction, from \nthe “less complex” to the “more complex” realm. Indeed, forensic \nevaluations become more complex with increasing level in the \nhierarchy of propositions, with the unavailability of methods, \nmodels, and data, and with increasing number of variables that \nmay contribute to the assignments of probabilities. To be clear, \nthe term “less complex” is not used to mean that any forensic \nevaluation is trivial, but it indicates that in some activities of \nforensic science, the methods of evaluation are established \nand well documented, while in others, practitioners have to \nresort on their personal experience through methods that are \nless documented in the peer-­reviewed literature.\nIn this commentary, we limit the discussion to the first two \ntypes of evaluative statements, to which LRs have been applied: \nsource-­based and activity-­based.\n3  |  WHAT ARE THE EVALUATIVE \nSTATEMENTS AND METHODS RELEVANT \nTO BPA?\nLet us consider now what type of evaluative statements are ex-\npected from BPA experts, and what methods are used to evaluate \nthese statements. To do so, we review, in Table 1, the goals and \nmethods of BPA and the forensic discipline that examines traces \nof blood for the purpose of crime scene reconstruction and court \nFI G U R E 1 The diagonal arrow shows that the complexity in \nassigning likelihood ratios increases with, on the vertical axis, the \nhierarchy of propositions (source, activity, and offense), and, on \nthe horizontal axis, the method/knowledge used to assign the \nassociated probabilities.

Introduction\nThe Organization of Scientiﬁc Areas Committee’s (OSAC)\nbloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) subcommittee has recently\nreported a call to determine the differences between fresh, whole\nhuman blood and various blood substitutes for use in research,\ntraining and case experimentation [1]. The subcommittee suggests\nthat further research can help with understanding the relationship\nbetween the physical characteristics of blood and other ﬂuids and\nthe mechanisms that cause pattern formation [1]. This work\ncomplements this idea by exploring the contributions of surface\ntension, density and viscosity to droplet spread and passive drip\nstain formation of various forensic blood substitutes (FBS).\nPreviously, our sol–gel formulation has demonstrated validity\nin passive dripping simulation [2]. We can further evaluate the\nutility of our materials by investigating the ﬂuid dynamics of\nspread. We extend our previous data set [2] by creating more\ndroplets of various size and impact velocities. This helps to provide\na more comprehensive understanding of droplet spread in\npractical crime scene reconstruction. We can then compare the\nresults of the sol–gel materials to the expected whole human blood\nrange in passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. Validation of a\nforensic blood substitute is an important component of its\nimplementation into research and training exercises. This is\nparticularly true with commonly encountered [3], well researched\n[4] and extensively taught [5] bloodstains patterns associated with\nbloodletting events.\nDroplet impact and spreading dynamics have been heavily\nexplored in the literature [6]. Traditionally, spread has been\nmodeled in bloodstain pattern analysis, and other areas of ﬂuid\ndynamics, using either the droplet’s Weber number and/or\nReynolds number [4,7]. A recent study suggests that the accuracy\nof the model can be enhanced by blending terms from both the\ncapillary and viscous regimes of the ﬂuid [8]. Our work supports\nthis idea, and we use the Scheller and Bouseﬁeld relation [9] to\nlinearize the spreading ratios of six different ﬂuids. This work\nextends previous work that uses the correlation as a platform to\ntest candidate FBS materials [10] as it can be used to express both\nNewtonian and non-Newtonian spreading by using a ﬂuid’s high\nshear, or effective viscosity [11]. In this paper we investigate the\nspread of six ﬂuids, water, two commercial blood substitutes, and\n* Corresponding author at: Chemistry Department, Trent University,\n1600 West Bank Drive, Peterborough, Ontario, K9J 0G2, Canada.\nE-mail address: avreugdenhil@trentu.ca (A.J.

No blood was observed on the ceiling during or after the\ntesting. The spread of blood droplets from impact was determined\nto be in the approximate range between 300\u0003 and 360\u0003 in front of\nthe device.\nThe placement of the incremental slots was based on the impact\nvelocity and spread of the blood during the pilot study. The initial\nminimum position for the arm (C) was identiﬁed based on the\nsmaller spread and distance travelled and the maximum position (G)\nby the smallest droplets. The remaining three increments (D, E and F)\nwere placed at equidistant positions on the marine ply bracket\nbetween the minimum (C) and maximum (G) positions (Fig. 5).\nDuring further testing, it was noted that the previously\nidentiﬁed minimum position (C) was generating a relatively high\nvelocity and kinetic force, which resulted in all ﬁve initially\nselected increments producing similar bloodstain sizes and\ndistances. Therefore, two incremental slots (A and B) were added\nduring the course of testing.\n2.3. Impact force\nPrior to attaching the arm to the device, it was weighed using a\nMettler Toledo SB32001 DeltaRange electronic scale (including the\nbearings and countersunk metal eye hook) to obtain the total mass\nof 2.1925 kg (m).\nAs the F17 timber arm was rotating around a ﬁxed axis,\ncalculations were required to determine the angular momentum,\nthe ﬁnal velocity of the arm’s centre of mass and the kinetic energy\nthat would be transferred from the arm to the liquid blood. A\nMecmesin BFG 50 N basic force gauge was used to record the force\n(F1) applied to the arm by the spring at each of the seven\nincrements (A–G). The displacement of the spring from the rest\nposition (x) to increment positions A–G were also recorded. The\nheight from the centre of mass (half way between the axis point\nand the distal end of the arm) was marked and the vertical distance\nbetween the start and the end position of the arm was recorded (h).\nKnowing the distance from axis to the spring anchor point on the\narm (0.28 m) and the force applied to the arm by the spring at each\nincrement, the downward force (Fp) applied to the arm by the\nspring at the centre of mass (0.49 m) could be calculated for each\nincrement (0.28F1 = 0.49Fp).

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

The authors found correlations for experi-\nmental data for a variety of liquids against Reynolds numbers\nof up to 25,000 and Weber numbers of up to 4000 for ReI\nagainst the number of spines and the ratio of stain size to drop\nsize. This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation\nnow (mis)printed as\nReI / ðRe1=2We1=4Þ0:75\nð11Þ\nhereafter referred to as ReIM.\nHowever, the above work only considered the vertical impact of\nblood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-\nface. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the\nvertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little\nwork on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either\nonto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45\u0002\nto validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the\nflow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).\nBy looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper\nthis paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine\nthe impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for\nwhich the vertical impact is simply a special case.\nExperimental Technique\nAs in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has\nbeen shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood\nwas mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.\nBlood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood\nto be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37\u0002C and removed\nonly when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were\ncarried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in\na fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at\nthe end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),\nviscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)\nfor pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).\nThe blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at\nheights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,\nresulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-\nette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-\nferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–\n5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting\nof blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically\nto impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give\nimpact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90\u0002 to the hori-\nzontal. For the 22.7\u0002 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used\nand for the small pipette at 90\u0002 to the horizontal, extra heights of\n20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-\nard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,\nand surface slope was repeated six times.\nThe last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-\ntom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at\n1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured\nusing the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera\nsoftware version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly\nusing the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the\ndroplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that\nif inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it\nwas taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size\nwas measured and the number of spines around the entire stain\n(360\u0002) was counted by hand.

This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation\nnow (mis)printed as\nReI / ðRe1=2We1=4Þ0:75\nð11Þ\nhereafter referred to as ReIM.\nHowever, the above work only considered the vertical impact of\nblood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-\nface. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the\nvertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little\nwork on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either\nonto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45\u0002\nto validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the\nflow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).\nBy looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper\nthis paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine\nthe impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for\nwhich the vertical impact is simply a special case.\nExperimental Technique\nAs in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has\nbeen shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood\nwas mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.\nBlood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood\nto be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37\u0002C and removed\nonly when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were\ncarried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in\na fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at\nthe end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),\nviscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)\nfor pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).\nThe blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at\nheights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,\nresulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-\nette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-\nferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–\n5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting\nof blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically\nto impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give\nimpact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90\u0002 to the hori-\nzontal. For the 22.7\u0002 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used\nand for the small pipette at 90\u0002 to the horizontal, extra heights of\n20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-\nard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,\nand surface slope was repeated six times.\nThe last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-\ntom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at\n1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured\nusing the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera\nsoftware version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly\nusing the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the\ndroplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that\nif inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it\nwas taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size\nwas measured and the number of spines around the entire stain\n(360\u0002) was counted by hand. For each angle and height, the results\nwere averaged over the six replicates. The stain size and number of\nspines were then plotted against a number of variables to obtain a\ncorrelation coefficient.\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the effect of impact angle on the number of\nspines obtained and the stain size and shape. As shown in previous\nwork (1), as the impact angle increases, i.e., becomes closer to a\nvertical impact, the stain becomes shorter, until for a vertical\nimpact a circular stain is generated (Fig. 1a).

From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the number of\nspines increases as the impact angle increases. As the drop size or\nimpact velocity increase the stain size and number of spines also\nincreases for an angled impact, Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, as pre-\nviously demonstrated in Ref.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

The\nsame routine was employed to ﬁnd the solution of the equations\nfor the drop Cartesian coordinates. The computing time required\nfor each simulation was typically 10 s with the time step\nDt = 10\u00043–10\u00045 s. The time step was determined based on a\nsolution convergence criterion of six orders of magnitude (10\u00046).\nFor drop oscillations modeling each period of oscillations (T) was\nrepresented by at least 100 time steps (Dt = T/100).\n4. Drop deformation models\nThe blood drop was considered to deform into an oblate or\nprolate spheroid (ellipsoid of revolution about its minor or major\naxes) [20] when subjected to a deforming aerodynamic force\n(Fig. 3).\nThe level of drop deformation during ﬂight is believed to be\ninﬂuenced by both the intensity and the rate of change of the\napplied aerodynamic forces. A drop responds differently in the case\nof slow, gradual loading (as in free fall), compared to sudden or\nimpulsive loading (e.g. shock wave disturbance).\nIn practice, the aerodynamic loading of the drop varies as its\nrelative velocity changes during accelerated motion. In light of this\nthree alternative models for the modeling of drop distortion during\nﬂight were incorporated in the present scheme.\nTwo of these included correlations for the aspect ratio of a\ndeformed drop (AR), as a measure of its distortion, at steady\nterminal conditions, when drag force on a drop is balanced by its\nweight \nwith \neither \nAR ¼ ½4=17ðð17Bo=4Þ þ 1Þ1=2 þ ð13=17Þ\u0005\n\u00043=2\n[28], where Bo ¼ rgd2\n0=4s; or AR ¼ ð1 þ 0:07We1=2Þ\n\u00043 [23] with\nWe ¼ rairV2\nreldo=s.\nThe models were assumed to be suitable for relatively large\ndrops that are moving with velocities lower than their terminal\nvelocities (e.g. passive drops) as an extreme case of maximum\npossible deformation.\nThe third model for drop deformation was based on the Taylor\nAnalogy Breakup (TAB) model for low-Weber number sprays [29].\nThe model is based on an analogy between an oscillating and\nπ\ny\nz\nx\nv 0y\n \nv 0x \nv 0z \nγ0 \nβ 0 \nα 0\nH \nL\nZ \n,\nz\ny \nx\nd0 \nFig. 2.

The majority of blood drops imaged in the course of this study\nﬁtted these criteria. Lift force is important for the case of irregularly deformed drops\nand rotational motion.\n3 In general, for a particle during its accelerating (transient) motion, the\nadditional virtual mass force and Bassett history force should also be considered\n[60]. However, due to the relatively high density ratio of blood (or water) to that of\nair (831 < r/rair < 880) the virtual mass term may be neglected. The Basset history\nterm is not generally negligible, however, due to its complexity, difﬁculty in\nimplementation and more pronounced effects for the movement at high\nacceleration, it was not considered. Evaluation of the magnitude of Basset force\nin different multiphase ﬂow applications can be found in Liang and Michaelides\n[61]. These authors found that the Basset force may be neglected in the particle\nequation of motion only when the ﬂuid to particle density ratio is very high (gas\nbubbles in liquids) and the particle diameter is greater than 1 mm. For movement\nwith high acceleration however, the Basset term can exceed the Stokes’ term by as\nmuch as a factor of two. These conditions are not thought to be met for typical BPA\ndrops.\nN.

Additionally, during\nthe ﬁrst 100 ms after contact, the heat would be expected to dif-\nfuse throughout the glass substrate by a distance √αst ≈210 µm,\nwhere αs is the thermal diffusivity of the substrate (Table S1).\nBecause this distance is much less than the millimeter thickness\nof the glass and radius of the footprint, this early-time heat trans-\nfer can be approximated as one-dimensional and semiinﬁnite.\nAfter a pulse of energy, the surface temperature of a semi-\ninﬁnite, one-dimensional substrate decays in time following the\nclassic self-similar equation\nT(z = 0, t) −Ts =\nQ\nksπr 2m\np\nπt/αs\n,\n[1]\nwhere ks is the thermal conductivity and πr 2\nm is the contact area\nover which the energy Q is deposited. For a drop bouncing on\na superhydrophobic surface, the energy transfer is not instanta-\nneous; however, the residence time is signiﬁcantly shorter than\nthe subsequent temperature decay, so the heat transfer can be\nestimated by ﬁtting Eq. 1 to the average surface temperature in\nFig. 2B (dotted line). For the drop shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the\nestimated heat transferred is Q = 10 mJ.\nRole of Drop Size and Temperature. To explore the physics under-\nlying the ﬁnite-time heat transfer, we carry out a series of exper-\niments in which we systematically vary the drop size R and its\ninitial temperature Tℓ. In these experiments, we use water as\nthe liquid and soot-coated glass as the substrate. Additionally, we\nadjust the impact velocityU to constrain the spreading factor to\na range between rm/R = 1.2 and 1.7. Repeating the steps illus-\ntrated in Figs. 1 and 2, we calculate the transferred heat Q for\nvarying drop sizes R and temperature differences ∆T = Tℓ−Ts\n(Fig. 3). To illustrate the effect of the temperature difference\n∆T on the transferred heat Q, the data in Fig. 3 are sepa-\nrated into 10 ◦C increments, each of which is represented with\na different symbol orientation. Note that ∆T is negative when\ncold drops, rather than hot drops, impact the superhydrophobic\nsurface. The high-speed optical images allow us to identify the\nspreading factor rm/R for each drop, which are separated into\n0.1 increments depicted with symbol color and contrast (Fig. 3).\nAs the temperature difference, drop size, and spreading factor\nincrease, the amount of heat transferred increases as well.\nA key feature of bouncing drops on superhydrophobic and\nsuperheated surfaces is the trapped gas or vapor under the drop.\nIf this gas layer acts as a thermal barrier, we might expect the\nheat ﬂux to scale with an effective barrier thickness δ. For a given\nspreading factor, this model would predict the amount of heat\ntransferred to scale as the conduction heat ﬂux across the bar-\nrier ˙q ∼kg∆T/δ—where kg is the thermal conductivity of the\nconﬁned gas layer—integrated over the contact area ∼R2 for\nthe duration of the residence time tr ∼(ρℓR3/γ)\n1/2. Given the\nimportance of the air-ﬁlled microscale roughness on the super-\nhydrophobicity, a natural scale for the thickness δ might be the\nthickness of the superhydrophobic coating itself, which would not\nvary with drop size or contact time. From a simple scaling per-\nB\nA\nFig. 3.\nMeasurements of heat transferred by drops. (A) The exchanged\nheat Q varies with the drop size R; the temperature difference ∆T between\nthe drop and substrate (symbol orientation); and the extent of spreading,\nor spreading factor, rm/R (symbol color). The black arrows illustrate drops\nbouncing off of the substrate, leaving behind either a warm or cool foot-\nprint. (B) The data collapse into single curves for ﬁxed rm/R when the trans-\nferred heat Q is normalized by the initial temperature difference ∆T, show-\ning a power-law dependence on the drop radius R. Note that the larger\ntriangle corresponds to the speciﬁc drop illustrated in Fig. 2.\nspective, integrating with a constant gap thickness would lead to\nQ/∆T ∼(kg/δ)trR2 ∼(kg/δ)(.ρℓ/γ)0.5 R3.5.\nAn alternative hypothesis is that the trapped gas within the\nsuperhydrophobic microtexture has a negligible inﬂuence on\nthe heat transfer and that the heat transfer is dominated by the\nsubstrate below. In this case, the heat continues to propagate\ndownward into the substrate as the drop spreads and recoils;\nthe characteristic length is self-similar and grows as\n√\nαt. By\nsubstituting this length into the heat ﬂux, we ﬁnd .Q/∆T ∼\n(k/√αtr)trR2 ∼(k/√α)(ρℓ/γ)0.25R2.75. To evaluate this hy-\npothesis, the experimental results for the transferred heat Q\n(Fig. 3A) are normalized by the temperature difference ∆T and\nplotted over a logarithmic scale (Fig. 3B). The data collapse onto\na single curve and are more consistent with a power-law scaling\nof R2.75 than R3.5.\nIt is also possible that the heat transfer is dictated by an air\ncushion above the superhydrophobic surface and that this gap\ndepends on the radius R in such a way to produce a scaling con-\nsistent with Fig. 3B. Speciﬁcally, research on the trapped air layer\nover smooth surfaces (32) indicates that the cushion thickness\nscales as δ ∼R(ρℓUR/µg)−2/3, where µg is the viscosity of the\nair.

The gas cushions the initial contact; it\nis entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the\nso-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Introduction\nA \ndetailed \nunderstanding \nof \nblood \ndynamics \nand \nstain\nformation is an essential prerequisite to the interpretation of\nboth individual bloodstains and spatter patterns. Within the\nliterature there is a fairly large body of work on both the spreading\nof liquids following droplet impact and on the splash features that\nmay also be formed in those circumstances. In only a few notable\ncases has blood been the subject of such study and the forensic\ncontext been considered. Consequently there is a need, not only for\na review of recent theoretical developments relevant to blood\ndynamics, but also for a systematic study of bloodstain formation\nand the application of current theories to model and hence\nunderstand the key characteristics of such stains. The work to be\ndescribed here aims to examine the stains formed following the\nimpact on paper of blood droplets in the millimetre size range and\ntravelling at a variety of angles and velocities. The spreading and\nsplash features are then interpreted following a review of\ntheoretical models and some conclusions drawn as to how such\nan understanding may beneﬁt the examination of bloodstains in\nthe forensic context.\n2. A review of the modelling of spreading and splash\nThe fundamental problem of explaining and predicting the\nspread of liquid following perpendicular impact on a smooth\nhorizontal surface has received much attention in the literature;\nfor example, see the review in Ref. [1]. The development of\nmathematical \nmodels \nhas \nprogressed \nalongside \nhigh \nspeed\nimaging experiments which reveal the mechanisms whereby the\nimpact of a spherical droplet leads to a circular, disc-shaped stain\n[2]. These show that the impact creates a lamella or boundary layer\nof liquid in contact with the surface which spreads rapidly in a\nradial direction while the majority of the droplet remains\nspherical. This stage is followed by the rim of the lamella swelling\nas liquid ﬂows outward from the spherical reserve to create a\nlargely-ﬂat, disc-like entity with a swollen rim. The material within\nthe rim may then recede inwards until equilibrium is attained. On\nsurfaces of low wettability this means that the diameter of the ﬁnal\nstain is likely to be less than that attained during the spreading\nphase. On the other hand, where there are surface-speciﬁc forces\nthat enhance wetting \nand are \nindependent of the \nimpact\nconditions, the ﬁnal stain diameter can be greater than that\ngenerated after the maximum spreading has occurred. Images of\nthese stages are given, for example, in Ref. [2].

The current\nliterature on theoretical models for the spreading and splashing of liquid drops on surfaces relevant to the\nforensic context of bloodstain formation has been reviewed. These models have been evaluated for a\npaper substrate using experimental data obtained as function of droplet size, impact velocity and angle. It\nis shown that for perpendicular impact there are fairly simple mathematical models for the spreading\ndiameter and the number of scallops or spines formed around the stain though these have quite limited\nranges of validity in their basic form. In particular, predictions for the diameter are best for small droplets\nimpacting at high velocity and the number of spines saturates for higher impact velocities. In the case of\nspreading, a modiﬁcation to the energy conservation model is found to provide excellent agreement with\nexperimental stain diameters across a wide range of impact velocities. For non-perpendicular impact, the\nwidth of stains is found to depend principally on the normal component of impact velocity and may be\npredicted by an appropriate modiﬁcation to the expression for the perpendicular case. Limitations in the\ncalculation of impact angle from the stain aspect ratio are identiﬁed and a theoretical basis for the\nprediction of spines around an elliptical stain is proposed. Some key issues for future research are\nidentiﬁed which include a systematic, quantitative study of the effect of surface properties on bloodstain\nformation.\n\u0002 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction\nThe Organization of Scientiﬁc Areas Committee’s (OSAC)\nbloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) subcommittee has recently\nreported a call to determine the differences between fresh, whole\nhuman blood and various blood substitutes for use in research,\ntraining and case experimentation [1]. The subcommittee suggests\nthat further research can help with understanding the relationship\nbetween the physical characteristics of blood and other ﬂuids and\nthe mechanisms that cause pattern formation [1]. This work\ncomplements this idea by exploring the contributions of surface\ntension, density and viscosity to droplet spread and passive drip\nstain formation of various forensic blood substitutes (FBS).\nPreviously, our sol–gel formulation has demonstrated validity\nin passive dripping simulation [2]. We can further evaluate the\nutility of our materials by investigating the ﬂuid dynamics of\nspread. We extend our previous data set [2] by creating more\ndroplets of various size and impact velocities. This helps to provide\na more comprehensive understanding of droplet spread in\npractical crime scene reconstruction. We can then compare the\nresults of the sol–gel materials to the expected whole human blood\nrange in passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. Validation of a\nforensic blood substitute is an important component of its\nimplementation into research and training exercises. This is\nparticularly true with commonly encountered [3], well researched\n[4] and extensively taught [5] bloodstains patterns associated with\nbloodletting events.\nDroplet impact and spreading dynamics have been heavily\nexplored in the literature [6]. Traditionally, spread has been\nmodeled in bloodstain pattern analysis, and other areas of ﬂuid\ndynamics, using either the droplet’s Weber number and/or\nReynolds number [4,7]. A recent study suggests that the accuracy\nof the model can be enhanced by blending terms from both the\ncapillary and viscous regimes of the ﬂuid [8]. Our work supports\nthis idea, and we use the Scheller and Bouseﬁeld relation [9] to\nlinearize the spreading ratios of six different ﬂuids. This work\nextends previous work that uses the correlation as a platform to\ntest candidate FBS materials [10] as it can be used to express both\nNewtonian and non-Newtonian spreading by using a ﬂuid’s high\nshear, or effective viscosity [11].

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

This conclusion has also been reached by other\nresearchers (Fig. 8) [13,63].\n2.3. Redox reaction mechanism\nWhile the identity of the emitter (3-aminophthalate) has\nbeen established for many years, the mechanism by which it is\nproduced in an excited state has been the subject of many postu-\nlated mechanisms [8,13,20,40,64–68]. A succinct description of\nthe current understanding of the probable reaction mechanism\naccounting for a number of ﬁndings from the aforementioned\nauthors was given by Barnett and Francis in their recent review\n[5]; based on this work and on the previous research especially\nby Mer´enyi and co-workers during the 1980s [20,64–68], the\ncurrently most accepted mechanism is presented in Fig. 9.\nLuminol in strongly alkaline solutions is deprotonated to the\nmonoanionic and the dianionic forms, with the former being\nprevalent between pH 8 and 14. The deprotonated luminol can\nbe oxidised, most likely by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin radical\n(OH-Fe4+-P•) and also by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin (OH-\nFe4+-P) to form radical intermediates, such as those described\nin the reaction with the true peroxidase enzymes, which can then\nreact to give an diazaquinone [20,68]. The diazaquinone can then\nundergo nucleophilic attack from the hydroperoxide ion deriv-\ning from the deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide (pKa 11.7)\n[20,39,40,47,68]. This is supported by the chemiluminescence\nintensity being dependant upon hydrogen peroxide concentra-\ntion, a factor which has been used analytically to determine this\nspecies [24,69]. An alternative path involving attack of super-\noxide (O2−) on the radical may also occur, especially under\nconditions where the radical is in low concentration [20].\nThe postulated mechanism following addition of peroxide\nto the diazaquinone (or superoxide to the radical) involves a\ncyclic addition of oxygen from the added hydroperoxide to the\nothercarbonylcarbonformingacyclicanti-aromaticendoperox-\nide whose bonds are particularly weak. The signiﬁcant amount\nof readily available energy contained in this species is then\ngained by cleavage and subsequent reorganisation of these\nbonds. Since nitrogen is an excellent leaving group because of\nthe relevant strength of its own bonds (and as a gas, it is also\nentropically favoured), the formation of the dicarboxylate anion\nby expelling nitrogen gas is favoured. The 3-aminophthalate\ndianion so formed is in an electronically excited triplet state (3-\nAPA*) (two unpaired electrons of the same spin) [8]. This then\nundergoes a slow spin-ﬂip process, to an excited singlet state\n(two unpaired electrons of different spin) which in turn decays\nto the ground state with the emission of light [38,40]. Evidence\nfor this pathway has been found by studies of diazaquinones\nwhich showed that these molecules give chemiluminescence on\nreactions with basic hydrogen peroxide without the need for\ncatalysts, the emitter being the 3-aminophthalate ion in an elec-\ntronically excited state (3-APA*) for the diazaquinone derived\nfrom luminol, with similar species being observed in the case of\nrelated diazaquinones [68].\nLight emission is almost instantaneous when luminol is\nsprayed on hematin, while with blood there can be a build-up\nFig. 8.

Subsequently, the A4 papers containing the simulated \nbloodstains were removed, air-dried and collected. The aforementioned \nprocedure was repeated 20 times, with the A4 printing paper being \nreplaced on the screen each time. Once the initial set of experiments had \nbeen completed, the experimental table was relocated, and the distance \nbetween the center of the polypropylene board and the screen was \nadjusted to 50 cm and 100 cm, respectively, for the subsequent repeti­\ntions of the experiment.\n2.3. Fly spots simulation experiment\nA domestic pig carcass (29.6 kg, Fig. 2) was obtained from a local \nmarket, slaughtered by the butcher, and subsequently frozen and \ntransported to the laboratory. Once the carcass had been fully thawed, it \nwas placed on plastic trays in the woods on the campus of the Southwest \nUniversity of Political Science and Law to attract necrophilous flies for \negg-laying. The plastic trays were then covered with vermiculite for the \nlarvae to pupate. Upon the departure of the third instar larvae from their \nfood sources for pupation, the fly pupae were harvested from the \nvermiculite. The most common necrophilous flies in the region during \nthe spring, summer, and fall were filtered from pupae for this study: \nChrysomya megacephala (Fabricius, 1794), Chrysomya pinguis (Walker, \n1858), and Achoetandrus rufifacies (Macquart, 1843) [26]. In the present \nstudy, the authors primarily employed the taxonomic identification \ncriteria from the Key to the Common Flies of China [27] to identify the \nspecies. The pupae were evenly mixed and divided into two equal por­\ntions, which were then placed in two fly-rearing cages. Blank A4 \nprinting papers were spread all over the bottom of the fly-rearing cages \n(130 × 60 cm × 60 cm, Fig. 3). Once the adult flies had emerged, dishes \nof milk and fake theatrical blood were placed into the cages. The feed \nwas replenished every two days, while the A4 paper lining the bottom of \nthe cages was collected and replaced until all the flies within the cages \nhad died.\n2.4. Image acquisition and processing\nThe A4 papers containing simulated impact spatters and fly spots \nfrom the aforementioned experiments were scanned with an Epson \nL6178 multifunction printer at a resolution of 600 dpi. To prevent \nmisclassification by the modified ResNet model due to color intensity \nfluctuations caused by adding milk to fake theatrical blood for fly \nrearing, and to streamline the matrix while improving computational \nperformance, all images were converted to grayscale and stored in TIFF \nformat. This study aims to distinguish between fly spots and impact \nspatters, which are challenging to identify with the naked eye. Due to \nthe limitations of the employed model, automatic localization of indi­\nvidual stains within the image was not feasible, necessitating manual \ncropping. In the preliminary analysis, we examined the imaginal body \nlengths of three fly species selected for the fly spots simulation experi­\nment. The maximum imaginal body length among the specimens did not \nexceed 12.60 mm. Therefore, stains larger than 12.60 mm in diameter \nwere excluded from the analysis. Additionally, this study manually \nscreened the impact spatters generated in the simulation to exclude \nthose with significant morphological differences from fly spots. When \nusing Adobe Photoshop 2021 to process the collected grayscale blood­\nstain images, we conducted a series of tests to optimally display the \nmorphological characteristics of each bloodstain. We determined that a \n600 × 600 pixels cropping frame was ideal for standardizing image \ncropping. This step utilized the batch processing function in Adobe \nPhotoshop 2021 to ensure consistency and efficiency in image \nprocessing.\n2.5. Image recognition\nThe overall structure of the convolutional neural network is depicted \nin Fig. 4. ResNet-18 is a neural network model that we utilized to \nidentify various aspects in bloodstain photos. With 17 layers devoted to \nextracting different details from the images and one final output layer, \nthis network operates similarly to a multi-layered image processing \nsystem. By separating distinct \"bits of information\" from the image, each \nlayer enables the computer to progressively \"understand\" the material. A \n\"batch normalization\" step, which helps stabilize the data as it passes \nbetween layers, and many image-processing layers (convolutions) make \nup each of the \"residual blocks\" that make up the ResNet-18 model. \nFurthermore, each block contains \"shortcut connections\" that allow data \nto bypass specific layers if necessary. This characteristic keeps infor­\nmation from \"vanishing\" as it moves through deeper layers, which is a \ncommon issue in complicated networks. By the time the information \nreaches the network’s deeper layers, the feature maps (data represen­\ntations) grow smaller but more sophisticated, allowing the model to \nmake correct classifications. In the last stage, all of the learnt features \nare combined using a \"average pooling\" method, and the classification \nresults are obtained via a fully connected output layer with two \nFig. 1.

Little blood appeared to\ntravel back towards the rear of the apparatus, potentially being\nblocked by the arm only leaving the front and sides to escape.\nWithin this research, the angular distribution of stains was not\nrecorded, as the focus was on distance rather than direction.\nHowever, it was noted that the majority of most distant stains were\nestimated to be between 300-360\u0003 in front of the impact plate.\nSeveral instances were however noted at more extreme angles,\nindicating that further research regarding the distribution of blood\ndroplets may be instructive.\nPrior to this research project being undertaken, the furthest\nrecorded distance, identiﬁed by the authors, in a published journal\nwas 3380 mm by MacDonnell and Bialousz [14]. It can be\nestablished from the results of this research project that these\ndistances can be expanded to 5360 mm and is more consistent\nwith the prediction of James [26] that blood may potentially travel\nup to approximately 6000 mm, although it is unknown how this\nﬁgure was determined.\n4.1. Kinetic energy\nThis research discovered that the change in kinetic energy\nfollowed a cubic trend with low distances travelled at low energies,\nincreasing rapidly when the kinetic energy was increased to\nbetween 1 and 5 J and decreasing again when above this energy\nlevel (i.e. above 5 J). When a disruptive external force is applied to\nliquid blood, liquid sheets and ligaments are forced out [5] and\nwhen the cohesive surface tension forces of the liquid blood/air\ninterface are exceeded droplets will separate [11]. Dependent on\nthe level of force applied to the liquid blood, the droplets may\nfurther deform in ﬂight into a “bag- or dumbbell-like shape” before\nbreaking up into smaller droplets which may have signiﬁcant\neffects on the overall drag force [12]. Once separated the blood\ndroplets follow a trajectory dictated by the velocity and by the\ncombined forces of gravity and drag [11,12]. Due to drag, the\nvelocity of the blood droplet decreases as it ﬂies through the air [5]\nas the forces of gravity act upon it. A paper by Kabaliuk et al. [12]\ncomprehensively details the ﬂuid dynamics of blood droplets\nfollowing an impact.\nThe low kinetic energy impacts in this experiment (<1 J) may\nhave created less disruption of the liquid blood and therefore\nproduced a larger blood droplet sphere with lower initial velocity\nand therefore more inﬂuenced by gravity, and to a lesser extent\nair resistance. The higher kinetic energy impacts applied to the\nblood in this experiment (>5 J) may have led to a larger initial\nvelocity of blood droplets reducing the initial inﬂuence of gravity\n[25] but potentially slowing due to deformation into secondary\ndroplets and subsequent effects from drag leading to a smaller\nﬂight range [12]. The medium kinetic energy (between 1 and 5 J)\nappeared to have created a higher velocity than the low kinetic\nenergy impact but potentially resulted in less deformation\nallowing the droplets to travel further whilst subjected to the\nforces of gravity and drag.\n4.2. Height\nThe height of the impacts appeared to have a more signiﬁcant\neffect on the distance blood droplets travelled than kinetic energy\nalone. The blood from Height 3 travelled further than Height 2,\nwhich in turn was further than Height 1. Whilst Height 3 obtained\nthe greatest distance, the signiﬁcance of height cannot be\nunderestimated in the context of an assault:\n\u0005 At Height 1, replicating an assault on a person lying at\napproximately ground level, the maximum distance that the\nblood droplets travelled was at Increment B measuring 3404 mm\nfrom the point of impact (bloodstain dimensions 7.2 mm \u0001 2.1\nmm) with an average of 3310 mm.\n\u0005 At Height 2, replicating a seated, crouching or kneeling person,\nthe maximum distance achieved was 4850 mm (bloodstain\ndimensions 8.2 mm \u0001 5.2 mm) with an average of 4582 mm\nachieved at Increment B.\n\u0005 At Height 3, replicating a person of average height standing, the\nmaximum distance being 5361 mm (bloodstain dimensions\n5.8 mm \u0001 4.9 mm) and an average of 4980 mm, again achieved\nat Increment B, these results were as previously identiﬁed the\nfurthest of the three heights.\nBased on the ﬁndings and observations of the experimental trials,\nit can be assumed that blood spatter droplets caused through an\nimpact having lower trajectories (\u0004250 mm heights) will travel\nshorter distances before impacting with the ground. The impacts at\nHeight 2, replicating a kneeling or crouching height of a person, and\nHeight 3, replicating a standing person, can be expected to create\nmoredistant bloodstains duetothe droplets being in ﬂight forlonger\nperiods of time before making contact with the ground. These results\nsupporttheﬁndings ofdeBruinetal.[25] withthehigherelevationof\nthe blood source, the blood droplets would have an increased ﬂight\ntime before they make contact with the ground.\n4.3. Practical implications\nWhen examining a scene of an assault the crime scene\nexaminer and/or the bloodstain pattern analyst must determine\nthe size of the scene. The general method is to start with the\noutermost stains and work inward, however this relies upon\nFig. 10.

The plot of the cardinality of the\nconsensus set against the SSE is found in Fig. 4. We observe a knee\nwhen the CS size is 17, so we pick that consensus set as the optimal\none, and base our ﬁnal estimation on it (clearly, the observation of a\nknee in the plot is highly subjective).

This axiom particularly\napplies when the number of bloodstains is limited because a single or few small bloodstains\ndo not often lend themselves to useful valid analysis. Conclusions based on crime scene pho-\ntographs should be conservative when the investigator has not had the opportunity to examine\nthe crime scene personally and must rely on the photographic documentation of others.\nHistorical Development\nThe study of bloodstain patterns and the consideration of the physical processes in which\nthe distribution of these patterns can reconstruct details of activities at scenes of death and\nviolent crime have recently emerged as a recognized forensic skill. Historically, bloodstain\nanalysis has suffered through a long period of neglect, and as a result investigators in death\ncases frequently have not appreciated the very obvious information available from this\nforensic tool. Signiﬁcant contributions have been made in this discipline as documented\nin the following timeline.\n1895 Dr. Eduard Piotrowski\nThe earliest known signiﬁcant study in bloodstain interpre-\ntation that has been documented and preserved was done by Dr. Eduard Piotrowski, assistant\nat the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Krakow, Poland. His work, entitled Uber Entstehung,\nForm, Richtung und Ausbreitung der Blutspuren nach Hiebwunden des Kopfes, was published\nin Vienna in 1895 (Figure 1.1). Piotrowski recognized that “It is of the highest importance\nto the ﬁeld of forensic medicine to give the fullest attention to bloodstains found at the\nFigure 1.1\nThe 1895 Eduard Piotrowski published study, Concerning Origin, Shape, Direction\nand Distribution of the Bloodstains following Head Wounds Caused by Blows."

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Discussion \nThe differentiation \nbetween suicidal \nand homicidal \ngunshot \nfatalities \nis - \nbesides the reconstruction \nof the death scene and the investigation \nof the entrance \nwound - \nmainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on \nthe shooting \nhand. In particular, \ngunshot residues like powder soilings can be \npresent even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination \nindicating \nthe importance \nof a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

    "text_chunk": "that might be due to the blood pooling towards that direction in\nthe sponge as discussed above.\nUsing the data from the high-speed videos of each experiment\nat 0.5 ms after the bullet impact, the maximum angular spread of\nthe forward and backward spatter was established by drawing\ntangents to the issued drop clouds near the target faces and\nreckoning their angles from the bullet axis. This resulted in the\naverage upper angles of the close-to-cone domain in which\ndroplets are issued for the forward and backward spatter of 27 \u0001 9\u0003\nand 57 \u0001 7\u0003, respectively, whereas the lower angles of the close-to-\ncone domain are 28 \u0001 12\u0003 and 30 \u0001 18\u0003, respectively. The detailed\ninformation on these angles is given in Fig. 7, with the lower semi-\nangles shown as negative.\nFig. 7 shows that backward spattered droplets have a wider\nspread angle than the forward spattered ones. The bare sponge\nexperiments 7Aa1 and 7Ab1 revealed an almost symmetric upper\nand lower angles of the spatter domains in forward and backward\nspatter. Such symmetry is less prominent in the other experiments\nwhich indicates that covering a sponge with silicone or tape results\nin an uneven distribution of droplets. This is important because\nthe initial droplet cloud signiﬁcantly determines their further\ntrajectories and shows that the effect of victim’s clothes may be\ncrucial for crime scene reconstruction. It should be emphasized\nthat blood droplets were seen to form from the target periphery\nnot penetrated by the bullet and continued to be formed long after\nthe bullet left the target. The above-mentioned angles correspond\nto 0.5 ms after the bullet impact. However, they vary in time, albeit\nnot too much, i.e. staying close to the values shown in Fig. 7.\nThe effect of muzzle gases on the blood spattered droplets is\nmore pronounced in experiments where the distance between the\nmuzzle of the gun and target was short. An example of this is\nshown \nin \na \nhigh-speed \nvideo \nnot \nanalyzed \nabove, \nwhose\nexperiment number was 7Aa7 which was a .22 cal bullet impacting\na blood-impregnated sponge at 50 cm. Several frames of this video\nare shown in Fig. 8.\nWhile the motion of the muzzle gases is difﬁcult to discern in\nthe still images, it is clearly visible in the video. The effect of the\nmuzzle gases is the following: as time progresses, the droplets do\nnot only move outward from the surface of the sponge, but are also\nentrained by muzzle gases impinging onto the sponge and turn\ntowards the left, which is against gravity and against backward\nspatter motion. This phenomena has been discussed in literature\nbefore [29], and clearly should not be ignored.\nTwo more observations worth noting were made when viewing\nthe selection of MFRC videos. Both of them are revealed in the\nforward spattered section of experiment 7Db2, of which a series of\nfour video frames are shown in Fig. 9.\nFirst, note that the angle of the bullet coming out of the target is\nnot normal to the target face. The forward spattered droplets seem\nto follow the axis of penetration and as a result, they travel at a\ndownward angle of inclination. Note that this trend is opposite to\nwhat is seen for backward spattered droplets in Fig. 8. For that\nFig. 5. The number of droplets in the PIV region of interest for each experiment. The\nred bars with negatively sloped crosshatching are for the forward spatter and the\nblue bars with positively sloped crosshatching are for backward spattered.

    "text_chunk": "expirated pattern has the highest density measurement, which again is \nconsistent with this pattern having the largest number of stains. How­\never, these density measurements appear to be lower than expected for \nexpirated and impact and this is likely to be due to the area of the convex \nhull of the pattern being measured larger than it truly is due to false \npositives near the edges of the target. As such it is likely that the density \nmeasurements for expirated and impact in particular are lower than the \ntrue values.\nThe convergence box calculated for cast-off 103 was much larger \nthan for the other two patterns reflecting the fact that cast-off patterns \nare not expected to have an area of convergence because the source of \nthe blood is not stationary. Fig. 9 shows the convergence heat maps for \nimpact 14 and expirated 9, and the centre of these heat maps accurately \nrepresent the differing positions of the blood source when these patterns \nwere created (close to the bottom of the target for impact and centrally \nfor expirated). For some cast-off patterns with limited stain numbers the \nconvergence was unable to be computed as there were no intersecting \ndirectional lines.\nThe convergence metric was the longest pattern metric to calculate \nparticularly for patterns with many stains as this created many in­\ntersections between the different stains directional paths which had to \nbe identified and counted.\n5. Conclusions\nOur main goal was to increase the objectivity of BPA by developing a \nmethod that could be used to extract quantitative data, including BPA \nspecific metrics, quickly and reliably from digital images of spatter \nbloodstain patterns.\nThe developed ABPA method described in this paper is an \nimprovement on methodologies described in prior research relating to \nquantitative BPA. We have demonstrated that the proposed ABPA \nmethod has a reliable and sensitive stain segmentation methodology \nthat copes well with shadows and uneven lighting, as well as different \nstain intensities, and is an improvement on both ImageJ and the previ­\nously reported Matlab developed method [18]. More stains and less \nbackground noise and/or false positives were identified with the pro­\nposed ABPA method compared to the previously described methodolo­\ngies. However, some false positives such as staple holes or marks from \nrulers were still identified as stains.\nWith regards to the BPA specific metrics, a novel approach to \nignoring tails and fitting ellipses was established resulting in accurate \nellipse fitting and therefore accurate impact angle calculations for the \nelliptical stains. A reliable approach to determining the location of the \ntail or spines on the stains and therefore their directionality was also \ndeveloped. Using the directionality and the orientation angle, the BPA \nspecific gamma angle was calculated for all stains with a circularity \nbelow 0.86. However, there were some challenges with irregular shaped \nstains (such as compound stains and flows) and the method struggled to \nfit accurate ellipses to these stains.

This study proposes that bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation can become a distinct\nand logical process by implementing an automated approach. To do this, an automated bloodstain\npattern recognition system was developed to enable the distinction of two types of spatter bloodstain\npatterns. First, global pattern features based on common bloodstain pattern properties were extracted\nfrom laboratory-generated impact spatter and cast-off bloodstain patterns. Following this, automated\nfeature selection methods were used to identify the combination of features that best distinguished the\ntwo bloodstain pattern types. This eventually led to the training and testing of a Fisher quadratic\ndiscriminant classiﬁer using separate subsets of the generated bloodstain patterns. When applied to the\ntraining dataset, a 100% classiﬁcation precision resulted. An independent dataset comprising of\nbloodstain patterns generated on paint and wallpaper substrates were used to validate the performance\nof the classiﬁer. An error rate of 2% was obtained when the classiﬁer was applied to these bloodstain\npatterns. This automated bloodstain pattern recognition system offers considerable promise as an\nobjective classiﬁcation methodology which up to now, the discipline has lacked. With further reﬁnement,\nincluding testing it over a wider range of bloodstain patterns, it could provide valuable quantitative data\nto support analysts in their task of classifying bloodstain patterns.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nRecognising patterns based on a sizeable body of knowledge\nthat has been stored in the human mind is regarded as a\nprerequisite to human expert decision-making [1]. Humans\nhave developed sophisticated methods of sensing and inter-\npreting patterns in the environment. Pattern recognition is\ncentral to a number of forensic disciplines including bloodstain\npattern analysis (BPA). The recognition of bloodstain patterns\nrelies primarily on the identiﬁcation of the pattern’s diagnostic\nproperties and an evaluation of the possible mechanisms by\nwhich the pattern was deposited. Together these form the\nprocess bloodstain pattern analysts term pattern classiﬁcation.\nThe limitations of pattern classiﬁcation as currently practiced, are\nthe qualitative nature of determining the properties of the pattern\nand the subjective judgement required to infer the pattern’s causal\nevent [2,3]. It is evident that this process encourages the formation\nof early mechanistic conclusions about the cause of a pattern\nbefore a full set of observations has been made [4]. This problem is\nexacerbated by the use of standard discipline terminology [5],\nwhich is largely mechanism-based. In fact, BPA taxonomies [6,7]\nform the backbone of bloodstain pattern classiﬁcation. So the\nboundary between observation and interpretation or reconstruc-\ntion can become blurred [8]. A key reason for this and other\npersisting issues, is the lack of a rigorous and standardised BPA\nmethodology [3,8]. Deﬁning a formal BPA methodology is the\nsubject of ongoing discussion among BPA practitioners [9–11].\nComputers offer a wide range of capabilities that can both assist\nand emulate human decision-making. Pattern recognition has\nbeen deﬁned as the study of how computers observe the\nenvironment, learn to distinguish patterns of interest and make\nreasonable decisions about different categories of patterns [12].\nPattern recognition systems can be based on identifying the pre-\n* Corresponding author at: The University of Auckland, School of Chemical\nSciences, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, 1142, New Zealand.\nE-mail address: ravishkaa@gmail.com (R.M.

A panel of\nexperienced bloodstain pattern analysts examined over 400 spatter patterns on three rigid non-absorbent surfaces. The patterns varied in spatter\ntype and extent. A case summary accompanied each pattern that either contained neutral information, information to suggest the correct pattern\n(i.e., was positively biasing), or information to suggest an incorrect pattern (i.e., was negatively biasing). Across the variables under examina-\ntion, 13% of classifications were erroneous. Generally speaking, where the pattern was more difficult to recognize (e.g., limited staining extent\nor a patterned substrate), analysts became more conservative in their judgment, opting to be inconclusive. Incorrect classifications increased as\na function of the negatively biasing contextual information. The implications of the findings for practice are discussed.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, error rate, reliability, contextual bias, cognitive science\nBloodstains are a common by-product of violent crime, and\nanalysis of these stains is a vital part of a crime scene investiga-\ntion. Despite the fact that DNA analysis can now routinely iden-\ntify the individuals that have bled at a scene, other important\nquestions can remain unanswered. For example, it is not uncom-\nmon for a suspect to claim that the blood found on his/her cloth-\ning was deposited when he/she was trying to aid the victim. In\nthese situations, understanding the mechanism by which the\nstains were deposited onto an article of clothing could be more\ninformative than knowing from whom the blood originated. This\nis where the analysis of bloodstain patterns can often give valu-\nable clues as to how the blood came to be where it was found.\nAlthough the dynamics of the formation of a bloodstain pat-\ntern appear to be infinitely variable, it is nevertheless true that\nbloodstain patterns have reproducible characteristics that allow a\nconnection to be made between the distribution of bloodstains\nand the underlying mechanism of their formation. Thus, at the\nheart of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the recognition and\nclassification of the bloodstain pattern.\nBPA has been used in criminal investigations since the 1800s.\nLike many other disciplines from the early days of forensic\nscience, its use and acceptance occurred without rigorous valida-\ntion. The Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC)\nBPA Subcommittee (previously the Scientific Working Group\non Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN)) has made valu-\nable progress in setting standards for training and education, ter-\nminology, quality assurance, and validation of new procedures\nfor the discipline (1–3). Like other forensic practitioners, how-\never, bloodstain pattern analysts are grappling with the problem\nof assessing the reliability of the methodology that they use. At\nthis time, very little is known about this beyond the instincts of\nexperienced instructors and investigators who have observed the\nreproducibility of bloodstain patterns over many crime scenes\nand practical sessions in the classroom. While such experience\nhas served as the main basis for assessing the reliability of BPA\ntestimony in the past, the courts now rightly demand much\nmore. Indeed, establishing accuracy and reliability measures in\nforensic disciplines was a key recommendation in the National\nResearch Council’s 2009 (4) report on the state of forensic\nscience.\nThere are several factors that may influence the reliability of\nbloodstain pattern classifications. First, different bloodletting\nmechanisms can give rise to bloodstain patterns that possess\nsimilar or indistinguishable characteristics. For example blunt\nforce impact and expiration patterns (2) can both feature small\nbloodstains and as such may be confused with one another. Sec-\nond, at times, a pattern might only comprise one, or a small\nnumber of stains, meaning an analyst must decide if he/she has\nsufficient data to make a reliable classification.

Taking the\ndensity of horse blood as 1050 kg m\u00043 [36], this result gives the\nsurface tension of the blood, under the conditions of these\nexperiments, as 0.0667 N m\u00041; this appears to be in line with\nvalues for surface tension for blood from other mammalian\nspecies. \nIt \nshould \nbe \nemphasised \nthat \nin \nthe \ncalculations\nthroughout this work it is this ratio that is utilised in calculations\nrather than the individual values of these two properties. The\ncapillary length for horse blood, derived from this ratio and used in\nsubsequent calculations, is a\u0002 ¼ 3:598 \u0003 10\u00043m.\n4. Results\n4.1. Radius-limited droplets: non-wetted nozzles\nThe detached droplet volumes from the conical nozzles, for\nboth water and blood, where the liquid was not allowed to wet the\nnozzle tip prior to droplet formation, are given in Table 1. The\nvolumes predicted for each nozzle diameter according to the drop\nweight theory (Sections 2.1 and 2.3) incorporating the H–B\ncorrection (Eq. (3)), are included here for comparison. It is clear\nthat, for each nozzle, the detached volumes for horse blood are all\nless than those for water due to the higher surface tension for the\nlatter liquid. For the most acute cone angles the detached volumes\nfor both liquids are very close to those predicted theoretically.\nAcross all cone angles these volumes remain close to the\ntheoretical values but are on average a little larger for the more\nobtuse angles and the widest nozzle diameter as these conditions\ntend to encourage slight wetting by the liquid. Since faster drop\nrates lead to an increase in the detached droplet volume [21] it is\nalso possible that working here with a rate of around one drop per\nminute rather than one every three minutes or more has\ncontributed to these experimental volumes being generally larger\nthan the theoretical values. Comparison between the droplet\nvolumes for the two liquids suggests that it is probable that some\nof the scatter in these values, outside of the standard error, may be\nattributed to microscopic imperfections in each nozzle arising\nfrom the machining process during manufacture.\n4.2. Angle-limited droplets: wetted nozzles\nThe experimental detached droplet volumes where the nozzle\ntip was pre-wetted with blood prior to formation of the droplet,\nare given in Table 2. These include outcomes from the non-bored\ncone tips where the pendent droplet was allowed to form slowly\nby blood ﬂowing across the cone surface. Uncertainties are\nincluded here again as standard errors. Note that these appear\nconsistently larger for the 150\u0007 and particularly the 180\u0007 tips, than\nfor the smaller cone angles. It is suggested that this is due to\ndifﬁculties in ensuring a consistent and uniform pre-wetting of\nthe tips and, for these large cone angles, a longer contact line\nbetween the pendant droplet and the tip and a greater area of\nwetting. These factors lead to more variation in the net surface\ntension force acting to hold the growing droplet in place and\nhence more variation in the consequent detached droplet volume\nbetween repeat measurements.\nThere are three principal conclusions to be drawn from these\nresults. Firstly, the pre-wetting allows much larger, angle-limited\npendent droplets to accumulate on a tip and the volume increases\nsigniﬁcantly with increasing cone angle. Secondly, for the 30\u0007 tips,\nthese detached droplet volumes are only a little larger than those\nfound for the non-wetted tips of the same cone angle (Table 1) with\nthat for the non-bored tip being the smallest and the others\nincreasing slightly with nozzle diameter. Finally, although there is\nsome scatter in the values, detached droplet volumes from a given\ncone angle are generally independent of oriﬁce diameter, including\nthose from the non-bored tips. In other words the volume, for a\ngiven cone angle, is the same whether it was formed on a bored\nor non-bored tip. The slightly lower volume obtained for the\nFig. 2.

Panel b taken with permission from Yokoi\n(2011).\nMotivated by the lotus leaf, superhydrophobic surfaces (i.e., hydrophobic and microstructured)\nhave been engineered using various pillar arrangements to make an impacting fakir drop bounce\nwith a restitution coefﬁcient as high as 0.9 (Richard & Qu´er´e 2000). In early studies, Reyssat et al.\n(2006) and Bartolo et al. (2006a) systematically varied the pillar height h and spacing ℓto ﬁnd the\ncritical impact velocity V ∗between the drop fully bouncing or partly wetting the surface (i.e., tran-\nsitions from full to partial repellency). This transition occurs when the impact energy is sufﬁcient\nto stretch the curved free meniscus between the pillars until they touch the substrate, giving\nV ∗=\n\t\nδh /ρℓ2.\nHowever, for even the most repellent surfaces at sufﬁciently high impact velocities, the spread-\ning edge of the lamella will break up, and only part of the drop can rebound. van der Veen et al.\n(2014) used color interferometry to measure the shape of the meniscus between such pillars. Most\nrecently, Antonini et al. (2014) applied X-rays to directly image the meniscus to pin down this\nwetting transition. Recent mushroom-shaped, double-reentrant, superomniphobic surfaces show\nbouncing of fully wettable liquids, such as hexadecane (Tuteja et al. 2008) and even perﬂuorohex-\nane (Liu & Kim 2014).\nRichard et al. (2002) demonstrated that the contact time of a drop impacting a smooth hy-\ndrophobic surface is almost constant, independent of the impact velocity, but grows linearly with\ndrop size. Bird et al. (2013) showed that this time can be reduced by a cleverly constructed pattern-\ning of a superhydrophobic surface, which breaks the drop into smaller pieces. They suggested that\nsome leaves and butterﬂy wings have developed such patterns. Moevius et al. (2014) demonstrated\nwhat they call a pancake rebound (Figure 9b). This occurs when the impacting drop spreads along\nthe texture but subsequently rebounds away from it before it can retract, thus retaining the ﬂat-\ntened shape when the liquid leaves the surface. This has the possible advantage of further reducing\nthe contact time of the drop with the substrate, which can be important in certain applications,\nsuch as anti-icing coatings. Coatings are also used to reduce bug-splatter remnants on windshields\nand airplane wings, on which impacts are usually at an angle (Yeong et al. 2014).\nThe next level of surface complexity involves modiﬁcations to promote directional rebounding,\nsuch as splitting the liquid into patterns or segmenting it onto wettable strips. Lee et al. (2010)\nstudied impacts on a wettability-patterned surface, consisting of hydrophobized radial spikes,\nemanating from the center of the impact location (Figure 9c). They successfully formed ﬁne\nradial ﬁngers at wavelengths different from the natural instability.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Error bars\nfor the aspect ratio values are equal to two standard deviations.\nThe uncertainties in We were calculated from the uncertainties of\ndrop size and velocity.\nThe correlation for the aspect ratios of drops at terminal\nvelocities \nAR ¼ 0:9951 þ 2:51 \u0003 10\u00042do \u0004 3:644 \u0003 10\u00042d2\no þ\n5:303 \u0003 10\u00043d3\no \u0004 2:492 \u0003 10\u00044d4\no ([49] based on Gunn and Kinzer,\n1979) was plotted over the experimental data points and provided\na good representation of the deformation levels of drops formed as\na result of a blunt force impact. In other words, the deformational\nresponse of an impact drop was concordant with that of a falling\ndrop under steady aerodynamic loading at terminal velocity. The\nbehavior of drops at terminal velocity was shown earlier to be\naccurately predicted by all three deformation models employed,\nwith the best ﬁt provided by the TAB model.\nAbout seven vibrational and eight bag-type secondary drop\nbreakup cases were observed for the impact spatter (Fig. 16). The\nbreakup was possible due to the presence of relatively big spatter\nblood drops (1–1.5 mm) which, upon formation, possessed high\nvelocities and thus Weber numbers (11–15) larger than the critical\nWeber number (8–12) for drop breakup commencement ([1]; [26];\n[23]). Most of the breakup cases occurred close to the impact point,\nwithin the ﬁrst 10–20 cm of the spatter ﬂight.\nThe drops were initially observed to deform into ‘liquid disks’\nwith aspect ratios of 0.3–0.4.\nThe latter was in good agreement with the critical deformation\nlevel for drop breakup of y \u0002 1 (or AR \u0002 0.35) postulated in the TAB\nmodel.\nThe maximum cross-sectional drop diameter (dmax) predicted\nby the [23] model was mostly within 5% of that measured\nexperimentally (see Table 4). Drops no. 2 and 8, however,\npossessed slightly asymmetrical distortion which affected size\nand aspect ratio measurements and resulted in the discrepancy\nbetween experimental and numerical dmax (by about 13%) and\ndiscussed latter breakup time tbup.\nAfter the maximum drop deformation was reached, drops\nfurther deformed into a bag- or dumbbell-like shaped depending\non the mode of breakup. The drops then disintegrated into smaller\nor child droplets. The vibrational drop breakup in the majority of\ncases resulted in the parent drop dividing into two approximately\nequally sized child drops, whereas bag disintegration produced a\nnumber of different sized droplets.

The amount of wicking\nwhich was occurring at 2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms\u00011 on the light calico\nresulted in similar mean dry bloodstain areas at these three\nvelocities (41.4, 44.0 and 48.7 mm2 respectively) and reduced the\ncorrelation of mean dry bloodstain area and velocity.\nThe dry bloodstains formed on the light (thinnest) calico\nspecimens from impact velocities of 2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms\u00011 had a\nlarger mean area than the medium and heavy calico specimens\n(Fig. 3, Table 4). However, there was only one statistically signiﬁcant\ndifference in dry bloodstain area among the fabrics at any of these\nthree velocities. From an impact velocity of 2.9 ms\u00011 (F2,12 = 3.951,\np \u0006 0.05), the light calico was statistically signiﬁcantly larger than\nthe medium calico. A larger bloodstain on a thinner fabric was also\nseen when bloodstains on a blend (65% polyester/35% cotton) plain\nwoven fabric were compared to those on 100% cotton and 100%\npolyester fabrics which had greater thickness and mass per unit area\n[12]. Although ﬁbre content may also have had an effect in this\nprevious work, it was suggested that the large bloodstain size was\ncaused by the blood spreading laterally over the fabric, rather than\nover and through the fabric [12].\nFor the medium and heavy calico, blood remained pooled on the\nsurface of the fabric when the blood impacted at a velocity of\n2.9 ms\u00011 or 4.1 ms\u00011 (Fig. 9b and c). At an impact velocity of\n4.9 ms\u00011 no blood remained pooled on the fabric surface owing to\nthe greater distance the blood spread laterally at impact. The\nincrease in lateral spreading also increased the mean dry\nbloodstain area with velocity (Fig. 3, Table 4).\nAlthough the blood could not penetrate the medium calico as\neasilyas the lightcalicoowing tothe smaller inter-yarn spaces, all the\nCT scans of the medium calico bloodstains at this velocity showed\nFig. 6.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6. Care was\ntaken when fitting each ellipse to account for the asymmetrical nat-\nure of each bloodstain (16). The long axis was subsequently\nextracted from each ellipse and then scaled to provide triangulation\nlines back to the AO. For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error. The\nfollowing projectile motion equations were derived.\nt = 10msec\nt = 15msec\nt = 20msec\nt = 25msec\nDroplet Diameter = 3.2mm\nPressure = 20kPa\nPressure = 40kPa\nFIG. 4—High-speed photograph time-series continued from Fig. 3.\nFIG. 5—A 0.2 · 0.2 m section of one blood spatter.

Such a \nparameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae \nwhich were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three \nout of six cases with homicidal \ncontact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. \nThe reason for the development of these conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings seems to \nbe ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or \nconjunctiva \ndue to the rapid expansion of the gas following \nthe discharge of the \nweapon tightly \npressed to the skull or introduced \ninto the mouth. \nThe lower \npercentage of positive \nresults in suicides performed \nwith revolvers (17%) when \ncompared, in particular, \nto rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the \nreduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction \nof this type of weapon. \nIn addition, \nthe gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns \ncan be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one \ncan expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive \nresults in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in \nour series probably due to comparatively \nsmall numbers of some calibres. Further- \nmore, the localization \nof the entrance wound \nand the track of bullet \nare of \nsubstantial \nimportance for the development of conjunctival \npetechiae. Our results \nverify that conjunctival \npetechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks \nof the bullet in close topographical \ncorrelation \nto the orbital region following \nthe \ndischarge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series \nonly one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages \nand the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures \nonly are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant \nentrance injury, \nfor example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems \npossible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity \ncartridges \ncan result in the development \nof pin-point \nbleedings of the conjunctivae \ndue to \nspecial biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition \ncould not be \nobserved. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following \nthe \nuse of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of \nthe weapon used since apparently \ninsufficient \ngas pressures near the orbital region \nappear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival \npin-point \nbleedings, besides other \nchanges like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand \n[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without \nother \nalterations like aspiration, \nwhich could influence the development of such findings, \nand can possibly provide additional \nuseful information \nin differentiation \nsuicide/ \nhomicide."

In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial\nfor the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop\ntrajectories.\n3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting\nWhen no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum\nradius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this\nmaximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances\nbetween inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact\nis performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete\nrebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).\nThis occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles\nin the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment\nmechanisms.\nThese retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability\nof the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009).

This was owing to the amount of time it\nwould take to fully wet the high linear density yarns of the medium\nand heavy calico as the blood was only soaking through from the\ntechnical face of the fabric. When investigating spatter bloodstains\non three 100% cotton knitted fabrics with different yarn linear\ndensities, as with the current work on calico, it was found the\nsmallest bloodstains were on the fabric with the greatest yarn\nlinear density [28]. The greater the yarn linear density, the more air\nspaces there are between the ﬁbres, therefore the more blood\nwhich is required to fully wet the yarns, before wicking can occur.\nThe blood remaining on the surface of the fabric would dry before\nmuch wicking along the yarns was able to occur. 1.7 ms\u00011 is the\nonly velocity where the heavy calico specimens had the smallest\nmean dry bloodstain area (Fig. 3). As the predominant method by\nwhich the bloodstains are being created on the medium and heavy\ncalico at this velocity is wicking vertically into the fabric under\ngravity, the greater yarn linear density of the heavy than either the\nmedium or light calico would reduce the ability of the blood to\nwick into the heavy calico.\nOn all three fabrics for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts the blood which\nremained on the surface of the fabric dried in the manner of the\ncoffee ring effect (Fig. 8a–c, marked ‘B’) [29,30]. The coffee ring\neffect occurs in many colloidal ﬂuids when the solutes move to the\npinned edge of the liquid drop to compensate for evaporative\nlosses [31]. This results in a higher concentration of particulates at\nthe edge of the drop than the centre, and is evidenced by a ring of\ndense blood surrounding the parent bloodstain.\nAs a larger volume of blood remained on the surface of the\nmedium and heavy calicos than the light calico, the coffee ring\neffect was more pronounced. The coffee ring effect occurred more\nextensively for 1.7 ms\u00011 impacts as blood pooled on the surface of\nall fabrics following impact and dried before wicking occurred.\nFig. 2.

The number of spots in each run, thus\nranked for sound level, is given in Fig. 4.\n3.2. Mouthing sounds and words in the upright seated posture\nthrough a bloody mouth\nThe number of spots of blood captured on the target for each\nrun is shown in Table 1. On average, each ‘P’ produced 271\ncaptured spots of which 2 were more than 1 mm dia.; each ‘S’\nproduced 313 captured spots of which 4 were more than 1 mm dia.\nFor the 10 ‘P’ runs, a total of 2060 spots were recorded including 16\nlarge spots – that is 1 large spot per 128 small spots. For the ‘S’ runs,\nthere were 43 large spots in a total of 3196 – that is 1 large spot per\n73 small spots.\nNote that the quiet ‘P’ sounds, used in the experiments with\nblood, were associated with rapidly developed peak pressures\n(Fig. 5) of less than 15 mm Hg; moderate sounds involved peak\npressures of around 25 mm Hg and the loudest ones were\nassociated with peak pressures of less than 35 mm Hg.

Furthermore, the RBCs present at their surface\nproteins induce a hydrophobic behaviour with all materials. This is observed with\nglass. The dried RBCs at this position in the drop do not wet the substrate and\nreveal an hydrophobic behaviour. This enables a cracking phenomenon linked with\nthe diameter of the drop, and consequently with the perimeter of the corona. For\nsmall drop perimeters, the stress inside the RBCs solid deposit is small compared\nwith large drop diameters.\n5. Concluding remarks\nObservations of the Marangoni ﬂow motion inside a drop of blood using a digital\ncamera at a good resolution (about 2.3 µm) enable us to show that the motion of\nRBCs at the edge of the drop is the main mechanism of blood drop evaporation and\ndeposition. The mechanisms involved in the blood drop evaporation are conﬁrmed\nthrough the evaporation mass ﬂux which is measured to be in agreement with a\npure water drop evaporation. Other biological elements (white blood cells, proteins)\nare transported to the edge of the drop with the RBCs and contribute to the\npattern formation through the deposit wettability with the substrate and mechanical\nproperties. The blood evaporation dynamic can be predicted by a comparison with\nthe pure ﬂuid evaporation case corrected by the mass concentration in colloids.\nTotally diﬀerent patterns are formed according to whether the person is healthy or\nsuﬀers from anaemia or hyperlipidaemia. This is leading our research to correlate the\npattern formation with blood diseases.

Discussion \nBlood and blood-contaminated items are frequently encountered \nduring a crime scene investigation, and extracting DNA from such \nsamples in the later stages of the investigation is critical to procure ev­\nidence regarding the incident and the criminal. However, criminals \noften try to clean up the blood at the crime scene in order to destroy \nevidence, and in some cases, they attempt to destroy evidence by \nwashing bloodstained clothing. Previous studies based on the determi­\nnation of location of the bloodstain after the washing process are usually \nconducted using chemical substances, such as luminol. Although the FLS \nsystems have been shown to be effective in detecting biological \nstains,11,12 the number of studies that employed the FLS system is \nlimited. Furthermore, the effect of blood persistence and stain lag time \nof washed clothes on the detection rate of evidence has not been fully \nexplored. Therefore, we used a cutting-edge Forenscope light source \nsystem (Forenscope), which is more efficient than the traditional \nforensic light source systems. \nIn the present study, the best FLS system image was obtained in \nvelvet, cotton, polar fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics.

As a result of \nthis evaluation, we show how specificities in scope (BPA being about activities rather \nthan source identification), gaps in the underlying science base, and the reliance on \na wide range of methods render the use of LRs in BPA more complex than in some \nother forensic disciplines.

The purpose of this study is to determine the \napproximate location of the blood source, i.e. the victim, at the crime scene by using an image processing and \nnumerical modeling approach. To achieve this, an experimental setup is designed with cardstocks and a cow \nblood-soaked sponge. In total, twenty forward spatter patterns are obtained onto cardstocks after successful \nshootings. In the post-processing phase, ellipses on the cardstocks are detected by processing the forward spatters \nin MATLAB. To achieve this, ellipse properties are identified for calculating the impact angles. The impact angles \nare then utilized as inputs to the tangent method within the program to estimate the Area of Origin (AOx). For \nvisualization, 2D and 3D images are generated. In conclusion, it is observed that the program works the best in \ndetermining the AOx, for the scenarios where the real AOx distances (blood source to target distances) are 35 cm, \n50 cm, and 100 cm respectively. The program’s weakness while determining AOx for the source distance of 5 cm \nis also reported. It is necessary to improve the program for short blood source-to-target distances and long \nshooting distances. It can be concluded that image quality is also a key factor for post-processing as it might \nmislead the results with visible ellipses.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstains are one of the most significant types of physical evidence \nand can greatly help to establish the connection between the culprit, the \nvictim, and the crime scene. The formation of the stains depends on \nphysical, environmental, and biological factors and can appear in \nvarious sizes and forms [1]. Patterns resulting from a force applied \ndirectly to the source of blood are referred to as impact spatter. Such \nspatters may be caused by firearms, blunt objects, stabbing, electrical \ndevices, or explosions [1]. The size of bloodstains is typically less than \n1 mm or larger, and the velocity of the applied force can start at 30 m/s. \nHowever, there is no direct correlation between stain size and the ve­\nlocity of the applied force [2]. By analyzing the spatter bloodstains, the \nfollowing questions can be answered regarding the crime scene: \n• Possible location and position of the culprit, the victim, and other \nobjects at the scene\n• Chronological order of events\n• Verification or refutation of statements made by the victim, wit­\nnesses, or culprit\nThere are a variety of software and algorithms developed in the \nliterature for the location of the blood source, i.e. Area of Origin (AO) \nestimation in bloodstain pattern analysis [3]. The aim of these methods \nis to estimate AO based on the size, shape and directionality of blood­\nstains. The string method is a well-known traditional method that uses \nphysical strings to determine the AO. This method is time-consuming, \nand its accuracy depends on the performer. Modern approaches use \nprimarily image processing and numerical modeling. The currently \navailable and most used programs include HemoSpat, Sherlock, Back­\nTrack, HemoVision, FARO Scene [3]. In the study by Arthur et al. \nMATLAB was used to analyze bloodstain patterns. Digital images were \nprocessed and basic features such as eccentricity, major and minor axis \nlengths, orientation, area and center of mass were calculated using the \nregionprops function.

The later guideline sets a compliance date by \nOctober 2026.\nThe present contribution has been motivated by observations \nmade in relation to the way BPA findings are reported in court. \nCurrent reporting practices in BPA rely on a classic approach [5] \nwhere BPA experts indicate that some of their observations are \n“consistent with” some stated allegations, generally without weigh-\ning the strength of their observations. As Evett et al. summed up [6] \n(p. 237): “At worst, the use of this phrase [consistent with] lays one \nopen to the criticism of partiality. At best, it does nothing to convey \nan assessment of the weight of evidence in favor of one or other of \nthe stated propositions.”\nTo the best of our knowledge, attempts to use LRs in BPA are \nvery few and very recent: an oral presentation was given by Leon \nMeijrink at the 2019 European Conference of the International \nAssociation of the Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, with abstract in Ref. \n[7]; Zadora et al. discussed the construction of LRs based on the \ninterpretation of spectroscopy measurement, toward evaluating \nthe age of dried bloodstains [8–­11]. There is also a current lack of \nguidance on how BPA evaluations should be reported. For instance, \nthe Bloodstain Pattern Analysis Subcommittee of the Organization \nof Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) for Forensic Science issued \nin the 2020 ANSI/ASB Standard 031, Standards for Report Writing \nin Bloodstain Pattern Analysis [12]. The document gives guidance \nwith regards to the formatting aspects of the reports, but none on \nhow the findings should be assessed and reported in the discipline. \nSimilarly, another standard on the validation of procedures, ANSI/\nASB 072 “Standard for the validation of procedures in bloodstain \npattern analysis” [13], has been reported to be vague and unfit for \npurpose [14]. In 2020, the UK FSR added to its code of practice and \nconduct an appendix on BPA [15] that is also silent on how the find-\nings are evaluated and simply refer to the ANSI/ASB Standard 031.\nWith this contribution, we would like to provide context and \nfacts to nurture the debate on a possible migration away from sole \nipse dixit opinion of the expert to a more structured way of forming \nand expressing opinions. Since LRs are not necessarily used by BPA \nexperts, this commentary first describes in detail the LR as a scien-\ntific approach to evaluating observations used in different domains \nof forensic science and then explores what the use of LRs would \nentail for BPA.\nWhen used to evaluate forensic findings, the LR, also known \nas the Bayes factor, is the ratio between the probabilities of the \nobservations under two competing and mutually exclusive prop-\nositions [16]. The propositions typically represent the contrast-\ning allegations made by the parties, whereas the observations \nare the forensic findings. The LR represents numerically the \ncapability of the observations to discriminate two propositions; \nits value indicates which proposition is more supported by the \nobservations. The logarithm in base 10 of the LR is also referred \nas the weight of evidence to be assigned to the observations.\nThere are significant advantages to use LRs in evaluative foren-\nsic opinions in court [17]. It forces forensic practitioners to consider \ntheir findings in the perspective of both the prosecution and the \ndefense, rather than, for example, only looking through the prism \nof the thesis of one side. Doing so ensures a balanced approach in \nthe sense that results are assessed in a way that considers the al-\nlegations of both sides. It allows bringing a fair assessment to the \ncourt whose main duty is to act as a referee between the views of \neach party.\nAnother advantage of the LR approach is the adherence to a \nlogical framework that invites the forensic practitioner to assess \nthe probability of the forensic observations under both proposi-\ntions, and not the probabilities of the propositions themselves, that \nbeing the reserved duty of the court. One of the key logical re-\nquirements of forensic testimony is indeed to avoid an error known \nas “transposing the conditional” [18] and making sure that the fo-\nrensic practitioners reserve their assessments to the observations \nand not to the propositions themselves. This requirement does not \nimply that all practitioners will reach the same LR assignments as \nthey may invoke different knowledge, data, and expertise to make \nthem, but at least their opinions will withstand scrutiny in a formal \nand logical sense. To achieve consistency in opinions, two mecha-\nnisms can be foreseen as identified in the FSR document [4]: a full \ndisclosure of the data used by the practitioner and its limitation \n(which is important to transparency), and the regular calibration of \nexpert's judgement through, for example, proficiency testing and \ncollaborative exercises.\nFinally, the LR approach strives toward transparency in the sense \nthat the forensic practitioners are invited to describe the data and \nexplain the methods and knowledge that contributed to their assign-\nments of probabilities.\nThere are certainly some difficulties to the use of LRs by forensic \nexperts in court. For instance, the use of LRs is grounded on the \nspecification of two mutually exclusive propositions representing \nthe defense and prosecution allegations. This basic requirement \nis not always met, as, for example, when the defense exercises its \nright to remain silent. Also, the propositions put forth by either the \ndefense or the prosecution might change during the course of the \nproceedings.\nThe availability of at least a pair of propositions (referring re-\nspectively to the position of the prosecution and defense) is a pre-­\nrequisite for evaluative reports, meaning reports that assess the \nobservations toward the use in a court of law. In the situation where \nthere is no constituted defense proposition or where the defense re-\nmains silent, the forensic findings are best presented in a report that \nis more of an investigative nature, offering lines of investigation or \npossible reconstructions, and not through an evaluative report [19]. \nIn BPA, we recognize that a lot of activities are investigative in na-\nture and will proceed to evaluation only when clarity on the alleged \npropositions is made. This commentary is primarily concerned with \nthe evaluative testimony. Finally, we note that the defense proposi-\ntion does not need to be restricted to a single option but may cover \nmultiple alleged activities that will be treated separately or jointly as \nshown in Ref. [16].\nNevertheless, the LR approach is recommended by the European \nNetwork of Forensic Science Institutes [2] for evaluations of forensic \n 15564029, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.14899 by <Shibboleth>-member@glyndwr.ac.uk, Wiley Online Library on [24/06/2025].

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

This left\nbetween 30 and 60 stains per spatter pattern, which could yield\ndirectionality, with elliptical short axis ranging between 0.5 and\n6 mm. Stain selection and measurements were based on the criteria\noutlined by Wells (16). These included:\n• Well-formed stains\n• Angle of impact <60\u0003\n• Equal number of stains from each side of the spatter pattern\n• Within 50% of distance from the furthest stain\n• Approximately 20 stains\nUnfortunately for each spatter pattern, after applying the first\nfour criteria listed above, only 8–12 stains were deemed suitable.\nThe z-coordinate (height) was calculated using the Balthazard for-\nmula based on the long and short axis of a best-fit ellipse overlayed\nwithin the ImageJ software, as demonstrated in Fig. 6.

For the purposes of triangulation, this method\nprevented any measurement bias as the long axis was determined\nwhile zoomed into the digital image for each stain, thereby hiding\nthe known AO.\nFigure 7 highlights the error associated with the z-coordinate for\neach starting blood droplet diameter and applied air pressure. With\na known z-coordinate of 86 mm, these results show an average\noverestimation of 43 mm (50% error), with a range of 16–64 mm.\nNo statistically significant relationship was found between the\ndegree of z-coordinate offset and either air pressure or droplet size.\nThese overestimations were expected given that straight-line trian-\ngulation does not account for projectile motion and drag. As a\nresult, two alternative methods for estimating the z-coordinate were\nexplored. The first examines the accuracy of reporting the lowest\nz-coordinate as a best estimate calculation. The second explores\nwhether projectile motion and drag could be incorporated into AO\nmodeling.\nAs straight-line triangulation consistently overestimates the z-\ncoordinate, the lowest z-coordinate measurement for each spatter\npattern was considered as a potential alternative. The results of this\napproach are shown in Fig. 8. The average overestimation was\nreduced from 43 to 7 mm (8% error) with a range between )10\nand 29 mm. In a few cases, the lowest z-coordinate resulted in an\nunderestimation. As using straight lines to estimate z-coordinate\nshould always result in an overestimation, we attribute this to mea-\nsurement error. As a result, if this method is utilized in casework,\nit should be reported as a best estimate and not as a maximum\nheight calculation. It should also be noted that it will be impossible\nto determine the variation around this best estimate because this\napproach only utilizes a single point.\nNext, projectile motion and drag were explored to determine\nwhether they might be utilized to reduce z-coordinate error.

    "text_chunk": "On rougher surfaces so-called prompt splash may result which\ndepends on the texture of the surface. In general both mechanisms\nare likely to be present to varying degrees and this may reduce the\ntransferability of Eq. (7) across a wide range of surfaces.\nFinally, brief attention will be given to the effect of the\ncharacteristics and properties of the surface itself on spreading and\nsplashing behaviour. In addition to roughness which has been the\nsubject \nof \nmost \nattention \nin \nthe \nliterature, \nthe \nelasticity,\nwettability and porosity of the surface are likely to be signiﬁcant\nfactors in cases where the surface is not a relatively smooth, rigid\nand non-porous substrate [6].\nAlthough it does not appear to have a very signiﬁcant effect on\nspreading [1,4], surface roughness is recognised as a factor in\ndetermining the splashing threshold. This is particularly the case\nfor low levels of roughness where an increase in roughness reduces\nthe splashing threshold and thereby promotes splashing. Con-\nversely a highly polished surface will suppress such phenomena by\nincreasing the threshold [1]. These qualitative links between\nsurface texture and splash features have long been recognised\nwithin the forensic context. Porosity in the surface will encourage\ndissipation of energy through the removal of liquid from the stain.\nThe elasticity of the surface has been found to affect the splashing\nthreshold [13]. While a rigid surface has a fairly low threshold this\nincreases as the elasticity increases since more of the energy on\nimpact is taken up as elastic energy in the surface.\n2.3. Non-perpendicular impact\nIn contrast to perpendicular impact, studies of the dynamics of\nliquid droplets impacting on an inclined surface are far fewer in\nnumber and consequently fundamental aspects of the formation of\nstain characteristics are more poorly understood. Bloodstains\nresulting from angular impact are considerably more complex in\nappearance than those just discussed. They show distinct variation\nin shape, size and splash features with respect to impact conditions\n(Fig. 3).\nIt was shown some time ago that the basic shape of the stain is\npredominantly elliptical though this may show some elongation in\nthe forward direction. Measurement of the axial ratio (W/L) leads\nto a good estimate of the impact angle u, conventionally measured\nfrom the surface, according to the accepted formula:\nsin u ¼ W\nL\n(8)\nA commentary on this early work has recently been published\n[14]. Although it appears that this formula works satisfactorily in\npractice and is justiﬁed to some extent on geometric grounds,\nsurprisingly there is no published detailed analysis of its reliability\nacross a full angular and impact velocity range. A semi-quantita-\ntive study using high speed photography discussed some of the\ncharacteristics of such stains and in particular has veriﬁed that\nimpact on an inclined surface produces similar stain features to\nthose found following perpendicular impact onto a moving\nsubstrate [15].\nMost interest in recent years has centred around the splashing\nof droplets on inclined surfaces often using moving belts or\nrotating cylinders to generate the necessary tangential velocity\ncomponent. Once again high speed photography has been used to\ninvestigate the mechanisms underpinning these phenomena. In\nparticular, it has been shown that the normal component vn\n(vn = v sin u) of impact velocity and hence the corresponding Ren\nand Wen numbers, determine the formation of splash features\n[16,17]. Hence, following the work of Ref. [10], the basis of an\nexpression for the number of spines will be:\nN ¼ 1:14We1=2\nn\n¼ 1:14We1=2 sin u \n(9)\nThis shows that as the impact angle is decreased the maximum\nnumber of spines produced will be reduced. It also appears\nreasonable that the transverse spreading of the stain which should\nbe largely unaffected by the impact angle also depends on vn and\nhence the elliptical stain width W would be given by modifying\nEqs. (1)–(3) appropriately, for example:\nW ¼ d\n2 Re1=4\nn\n¼ d\n2 Re1=4 sin1=4 u \n(10)\nFurther, the tangential component vt of velocity (vt = v cos u) is\nresponsible for either enhancing or suppressing splash around the\nrim of the elliptical stain thereby causing the observed asymmetry\nin splashing [18]. An expression has been derived [17] that deﬁnes\nthe splashing thresholds in both the forward and backward\ndirections of a stain formed on impact. Since the ratio of the\ntangential and normal velocity components is given by:\nvt\nvn\n¼ cotan u\nFig. 3.

When the stain\nsize is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the\ncorrelation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-\nsional number against a nondimensional number.\nThe circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-\nmeterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the\nstain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain\ndiameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as\nb (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape\n(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both\nthe stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Experimental protocol\nFor each trial, \u00041 ml of blood was taken from the pig blood\ncontainer in the water bath container using a 10 ml syringe and\ndeposited on the ﬂat plywood impact surface within the strike\nzone (i.e. the area directly impacted by the F17 timber arm outlined\nby marker in Fig. 6). Within seconds of placement, to minimize\nheat loss from the blood, a controlled impact was applied to the\nblood pool by releasing the F17 timber from its starting position at\neach increment. Each impact on the device was video recorded by\nusing a GoPro camera on a tripod with a timer on an Apple iPad Air\ndisplayed.\nAfter each impact the furthest lying visible single bloodstain\nwas located and measured horizontally to the point of origin (distal\nend of the F17 timber) using a Hilti PD42 laser measurer. To ensure\naccurate measurement, a vertical pole from the bloodstain was\nused to guide the position of the laser measurer. A high resolution\nimage using a Nikon D300 dSLR camera was also taken from\ndirectly above the blood stains (Fig. 7). The F17 timber arm and\nstrike plate were cleaned of blood residue after each test.\nFive replicates were performed at increments A and B at Height\n1 (250 mm from ﬂoor), and ten replicates for increments C–G. Due\nto results obtained at this initial height, increments F and G were\nnot tested at greater heights. Therefore, ﬁve replicates were\nperformed for A and B and ten replicates for increments C–E for\nboth Heights 2 (1160 mm from the ﬂoor) and 3 (1780 mm from the\nﬂoor), resulting in a total of 140 impacts across the three heights.\nVisual analysis of the ceiling of the room was also conducted to\ndetermine if any stains had reached that height. The distance data\nobtained was analysed in real-time during the experiment for\nconsistency and variation, with one sample t-tests being used to\ntest datasets within each increment to determine if additional\nreplicates were required to generate reliable results. Each group of\nreplicates was also checked during experimentation for normality,\nskewness and kurtosis, with z-tests being used to determine the\nequality of variances between adjacent groups (increments and\nheights) during testing.\nStatistical analysis was performed in SPSS v21.0 (IBM Corpora-\ntion, Chicago). The consistency of impact time and therefore\nkinetic energy across the repeated experiments was investigated\nusing a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparing\nbefore and after time measurements. A two-way ANOVA was\nconducted to compare the main effects and interaction of the\nordinal variables height and increment on the furthest distance\nblood travelled.\n3. Results\n3.1. Kinetic energy released during impact\nThecharacteristicsof thetimberarm, spring and increments were\nmeasured to calculate the ﬁnal velocity of the arm and the kinetic\nenergy imparted to the blood stain upon impact (Table 1). The\nconsistency of impact kinetic energy was investigated by measuring\nthe time taken for the F17 timber arm to travel from release to impact\nprior to the experiments across 5–10 replicates per increment, and\nthe corresponding time post-experiment with 10 replicates per\nincrement (Table 2). A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that no\nsigniﬁcant differences existed between the pre- and post-experi-\nment times overall (F2,53 = 0.066, p = 0.798), and that there was no\ndifferential changes in travel times between increments (F6,53 = 1.35,\np = 0.252). It can therefore be inferred that the time taken for the F17\ntimber arm to travel, and therefore the kinetic energy imparted, was\nconsistent throughout the experiment.\n3.2. Experimental test results\nThe impact height and kinetic energy imparted both inﬂuenced\nthe distance the blood travelled after impact. Impact heights of\n250 mm resulted in distances ranging from 2109 mm to 3404 mm\n(Table 3), with an overall average of 2835 mm across all seven\nincrements and 2109 mm from the lower ﬁve. Impact heights of\n1160 mm resulted in distances travelled of 2895 mm–4850 mm,\nwith an average of 3732 mm from the lower ﬁve increments.\nImpact heights of 1780 mm resulted in blood droplets travelling\nbetween 3256 mm and 5361 mm, with an average of 3901 mm.\nBoth the height and increment had signiﬁcant effects on the\ndistance that the blood travelled (height F2\n123 = 281.92, p < 0.01;\nincrement F6\n123 = 58.17, p < 0.01), with height showing a greater\neffect (h2 = 0.43) than the increment (h2 = 0.27). There was also a\nsmall but signiﬁcant interaction between the height and increment\n(F8\n123 = 6.24, p < 0.01), although this interaction had a minimal\neffect size (h2 = 0.04).\nFig. 6. \u00041 ml liquid blood (within the strike zone marked with blue marker pen) on\nthe marine ply strike surface.\nFig. 7.

    "text_chunk": "that contact angles between each of the surfaces, blood, and air\nwere measured and tabulated in Fig. 1b.\nThe spreading factor β of the blood stain decreased monotoni-\ncally with increasing contact angle u for the different microscopic\ncoatings (Fig. 7b, closed symbols). Although this wettability\nmeasure is often neglected when predicting bloodstain size, it is\nincluded in some models, such as Eq. (1). Yet the inﬂuence of\ncontact angle in the current results appears much greater than\nmight be expected from this model. To illustrate this point, results\nfrom the models (the ones that adequately predicted the ﬁnal stain\nsize for the clean glass slides in Fig. 3c) are plotted alongside the\ndata in Fig. 7b. Note that these models predict that the drop will\nspread out to approximately three times its initial radius for any\ncontact angle. The bloodstain on the clean glass slide spreads out to\nthis size, but the other ﬂat coatings result in ﬁnal stain diameters\nthat are 35–72% smaller.\nThe primary source of discrepancy between these models and\nthe current results is likely the tacit assumption that droplet\nspreads to a particular size and remains at this size as it dries. In\nother words, the ﬁnal bloodstain size rf is identical to its maximum\nsize rmax. Had this constraint held for the current results and the\nﬁnal stain were the same as the maximum spreading radius, the\nspreading factor would have been much closer to the predictions\n(Fig. 7b, open symbols). It should be noted that this assumption is\ncompletely appropriate for the clean glass slide, and likely\nappropriate for other clean surfaces. Indeed, if this assumption\nwas not made and the drops were completely free to adopt a ﬁnal\nconﬁguration that minimized energy, they would form spherical\ncaps based on their initial size and contact angle. In this case, the\nspreading factor would be completely independent of the impact\nconditions and depend only on the surface conditions.\nOne reason why blood drops might stay at their maximum\nspreading size on a clean surface is that the contact line becomes\npinned. It is well known that colloidal particle can jam at a contact\nline, preventing it from receding [41,42]. If this is the case, it makes\nthe authors’ choice of forensically-relevant coatings all the more\nnoteworthy, as they prevent the blood drop contact line from\npinning, at least initially. A reduction in contact line pinning is also\nconsistent with a reduction in adhesion between the dried blood and\nthe coatings. The dried blood on the oil-coated glass can be readily\ndisplaced and can completely detach from the superhydrophobic\nsurface with a slight external force, such as a gentle breeze. The blood\ndrops on the ﬁngerprint-coated glass appears to have more\nadherence, but still noticeably less than on the clean glass surface.\n3.3. High impact bloodstains on microscopic coatings and residues\nIt is natural to inquire whether the effects of the coatings that\nwere observed at relatively low impact conditions (Fig. 7) extend to\nhigher impact conditions as well. In particular, it is noteworthy that\nthe impact conditions for the larger blood drop (R = 2 mm) released\nat h = 100 cm (impacting the surface at U = 4.5 \u0003 0.2 m s\u00041), are\nsubstantial enough for splashing to be expected [43], yet no clear\nevidence of splashing is observed for the stain on the clean glass\nsurface (Fig. 3b).\nFig. 8 illustrates the ﬁnal bloodstain conﬁgurations when the\ndrops impact the various surfaces at this higher release height and\ndirectly compares them to the bloodstains released from the lower\nheight. Here R = 2.0 \u0003 0.1 mm and higher height leads to an impact\nvelocity of U = 4.5 \u0003 0.2 m s\u00041 and Weber number of We \u0006 1400. The\npresence of the coatings has an even larger effect at this higher\nimpact speed. The principle stain is smaller on the coated glass\nsurfaces than on the clean glass and more irregular. Indeed on the\noil-coated and superhydrophobic-coated glass, small droplets\nsurround the principle stain (denoted with arrows in Fig. 8).\nHigh-speed imaging of initial impact dynamics of these stains\nillustrates the drop on the clean surface spreads to a maximum size\nand the contact line remains pinned (Fig. 9). By contrast, the contact\nlines on the coated surfaces retract to varying degrees, similar to\nwhat was observed for the lower impact conditions. However, unlike\nwhat was observed for the lower impact conditions, the initial\nspreading of the high impact drops differs between the different\ncoatings. In particular, spines and ligaments develop on the oil-\ncoated and superhydrophobic-coated glass and breakup to form the\ntiny surrounding droplets (Fig. 9). On the superhydrophobic surface,\nholes nucleate in the center of the ﬁlm as it begins to retract. As these\nholes expand, more ligaments are formed, although many of these\nrecoalesce to form a principle drop.\nOver the drying timescale, the drop shapes changes only\nslightly, with the exception again being the stain on the\nﬁngerprint-coated glass (Fig. 10). As the drop on the ﬁngerprint-\ncoated glass dries, the contact line appears to ﬁrst stick and then\nslip, creating small ﬂakes of dried blood that are loosely connected\nto the surface. The drops appear to fully dry within an hour.\nFractures occur for the drops on the coated surfaces, which may be\ndue to a combination of them being thicker and less well adhered\nto the surface.\nThe differences in the bloodstain sizes between the low and\nhigh impact conditions for the various coatings offers a way to\nFig. 8. Comparison of bloodstain patterns at lower and higher release heights h for the various coatings. The dried stains can develop highly irregular shapes, and numerous\ntiny droplets surround the principle stains on the bottom left two images (highlighted with arrows). Here the initial drop sizes are all the same with radius R = 2.0 \u0003 0.1 mm\nand release heights are h = 10 and h = 100 cm. The scalebar of 5 mm applies to all images.\nS.

In the present \nstudy, the authors primarily employed the taxonomic identification \ncriteria from the Key to the Common Flies of China [27] to identify the \nspecies. The pupae were evenly mixed and divided into two equal por­\ntions, which were then placed in two fly-rearing cages. Blank A4 \nprinting papers were spread all over the bottom of the fly-rearing cages \n(130 × 60 cm × 60 cm, Fig. 3). Once the adult flies had emerged, dishes \nof milk and fake theatrical blood were placed into the cages.

Image acquisition and processing\nThe A4 papers containing simulated impact spatters and fly spots \nfrom the aforementioned experiments were scanned with an Epson \nL6178 multifunction printer at a resolution of 600 dpi. To prevent \nmisclassification by the modified ResNet model due to color intensity \nfluctuations caused by adding milk to fake theatrical blood for fly \nrearing, and to streamline the matrix while improving computational \nperformance, all images were converted to grayscale and stored in TIFF \nformat. This study aims to distinguish between fly spots and impact \nspatters, which are challenging to identify with the naked eye. Due to \nthe limitations of the employed model, automatic localization of indi­\nvidual stains within the image was not feasible, necessitating manual \ncropping. In the preliminary analysis, we examined the imaginal body \nlengths of three fly species selected for the fly spots simulation experi­\nment. The maximum imaginal body length among the specimens did not \nexceed 12.60 mm. Therefore, stains larger than 12.60 mm in diameter \nwere excluded from the analysis. Additionally, this study manually \nscreened the impact spatters generated in the simulation to exclude \nthose with significant morphological differences from fly spots. When \nusing Adobe Photoshop 2021 to process the collected grayscale blood­\nstain images, we conducted a series of tests to optimally display the \nmorphological characteristics of each bloodstain. We determined that a \n600 × 600 pixels cropping frame was ideal for standardizing image \ncropping. This step utilized the batch processing function in Adobe \nPhotoshop 2021 to ensure consistency and efficiency in image \nprocessing.\n2.5. Image recognition\nThe overall structure of the convolutional neural network is depicted \nin Fig. 4. ResNet-18 is a neural network model that we utilized to \nidentify various aspects in bloodstain photos. With 17 layers devoted to \nextracting different details from the images and one final output layer, \nthis network operates similarly to a multi-layered image processing \nsystem. By separating distinct \"bits of information\" from the image, each \nlayer enables the computer to progressively \"understand\" the material. A \n\"batch normalization\" step, which helps stabilize the data as it passes \nbetween layers, and many image-processing layers (convolutions) make \nup each of the \"residual blocks\" that make up the ResNet-18 model. \nFurthermore, each block contains \"shortcut connections\" that allow data \nto bypass specific layers if necessary. This characteristic keeps infor­\nmation from \"vanishing\" as it moves through deeper layers, which is a \ncommon issue in complicated networks. By the time the information \nreaches the network’s deeper layers, the feature maps (data represen­\ntations) grow smaller but more sophisticated, allowing the model to \nmake correct classifications.

Introduction\nFor crime scene investigation in cases of homicide or criminal\nassault, the pattern of bloodstains at the incident site is of critical\nimportance. The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to\ndetermine the approximate blood source locations in forensic\ncrime reconstructions.\nFor this approach, up to now, various methods of bloodstain\npattern analysis have been used [1–5]. The stringing method, the\ntangent method and the virtual stringing method are by the use of\ncomputer software [6,7]. In the stringing method, the trajectories\nof the blood drops are simpliﬁed as straight lines. The impact\ndirections of the bloodstains are reconstructed by afﬁxing strings\nat the position of the bloodstains and pulling them away from the\nsurface, on which the bloodstain has spilt, in the approximate\nimpact direction. This direction is determined by the directionality\nand relation of the length and width of the elliptical shaped\nbloodstain. The approximate location of the blood source is\nestimated to be where the majority of strings intersect. In the\ntangent method, the ﬂight path of the blood drop is assumed to be a\nhypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. This method is valid only for\nfast-moving blood drops with a ﬂat trajectory before impacting on\nthe surface. Due to unknown curvatures of the individual ﬂight\npath, unknown systematic errors in the horizontal value of the\nlocation of the blood source may occur [2]. The virtual stringing\nmethod\nis\nequivalent\nto\nthe\ntraditional\nstringing\nmethod\ntransposed onto the computer.\nIn the present work, a ballistic analysis to approximate the\ntrajectories of the blood drops, for the determination of the centres\nof origin of the bloodstains, is evaluated.\n2.

We examine its\ndependence on the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension.\nWe show that the splashing velocity is independent of the wetting properties\nof the surface but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of\nthe liquid. A preexisting splashing model and simpliﬁcation are considered\nthat predict the splashing velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. Both the splashing model and simpliﬁcation give a good\nprediction of the splashing velocity for each surface and liquid, demonstrating the robustness of the splashing model. We also\nshow that the splashing model can also predict the splashing velocity of blood, a shear-thinning ﬂuid.\n■INTRODUCTION\nWhen impacting a dry, smooth surface, a droplet either spreads\nover the surface (for low-impact velocities) or disintegrates\ninto smaller droplets (for high-impact velocities). This so-\ncalled splashing phenomenon has been the subject of\nnumerous studies over the last several decades and is of\nrelevance for a wide range of practical applications such as crop\nspraying,1,2 rain drops impacting porous stones,3,4 and forensic\nresearch.5−7 The splashing velocity vsp is deﬁned as the critical\nvalue of the impact velocity of the droplet beyond which\nsplashing occurs (Figure 1). Many studies have tried to ﬁnd an\nempirical relation between the splashing velocity and ﬂuid\nparameters8−13 and between the splashing velocity and surface\nproperties.14−17 In addition, Xu et al.18 showed that the\natmospheric conditions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on droplet\nsplashing,13,17,19 implying that the air viscosity is also an\nimportant parameter. To include the air viscosity, Riboux and\nGordillo recently proposed a theoretical model for impact and\nsplashing on smooth surfaces.20 They postulated that splashing\noccurs because of the breakup of a small liquid ﬁlm that lifts oﬀ\nthe surface just after the impact due to the lift force generated\nby the surrounding air.

We examine its\ndependence on the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension.\nWe show that the splashing velocity is independent of the wetting properties\nof the surface but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of\nthe liquid. A preexisting splashing model and simpliﬁcation are considered\nthat predict the splashing velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. Both the splashing model and simpliﬁcation give a good\nprediction of the splashing velocity for each surface and liquid, demonstrating the robustness of the splashing model. We also\nshow that the splashing model can also predict the splashing velocity of blood, a shear-thinning ﬂuid.\n■INTRODUCTION\nWhen impacting a dry, smooth surface, a droplet either spreads\nover the surface (for low-impact velocities) or disintegrates\ninto smaller droplets (for high-impact velocities). This so-\ncalled splashing phenomenon has been the subject of\nnumerous studies over the last several decades and is of\nrelevance for a wide range of practical applications such as crop\nspraying,1,2 rain drops impacting porous stones,3,4 and forensic\nresearch.5−7 The splashing velocity vsp is deﬁned as the critical\nvalue of the impact velocity of the droplet beyond which\nsplashing occurs (Figure 1). Many studies have tried to ﬁnd an\nempirical relation between the splashing velocity and ﬂuid\nparameters8−13 and between the splashing velocity and surface\nproperties.14−17 In addition, Xu et al.18 showed that the\natmospheric conditions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on droplet\nsplashing,13,17,19 implying that the air viscosity is also an\nimportant parameter. To include the air viscosity, Riboux and\nGordillo recently proposed a theoretical model for impact and\nsplashing on smooth surfaces.20 They postulated that splashing\noccurs because of the breakup of a small liquid ﬁlm that lifts oﬀ\nthe surface just after the impact due to the lift force generated\nby the surrounding air. In the model, the ﬂuid and substrate\nproperties govern the splashing as well as the air viscosity; in\nref 20, a quantitative agreement was found between the model\nand experiments on a single substrate.\nNumerous experimental studies have investigated splash-\ning;8−19 however, the inﬂuence of the wetting properties of the\nsurface on splashing has not been considered in detail. It has\nrecently been shown that the wetting properties of the surface\naﬀect droplet spreading at low-impact velocities.21,22 In the\nmodel of Riboux and Gordillo, the splashing velocity also\ndepends on the surface properties.20 The surface tension and\nthe wetting properties of the surface are closely linked through\nYoung’s law.23 Therefore, the dependence of the splashing\nvelocity on surface tension should also be taken into account\nfor a droplet of a given size.

Introduction\nScenes of violent crime are frequently associated with blood\nspatter. The patterns of spatter are often attributed to impact\nspatter, movements of the victim or assailant or cast off from a\nweapon. However, some blood may have originated from the\nrespiratory system and been distributed by mechanisms that\nfollow different physical processes and the observed distributions\nmay require to be interpreted in a different way. Furthermore, it is\npossible for such aerosols to be produced some time after death\nwhen liquid blood is still present. Founding fathers of pathology,\nsuch as Morgagni, Hunter and Virchow knew that, after violent\ndeath, often blood did not clot and acted as if it contained a\nﬁbrinolysin, although these facts are sometimes overlooked in\nmodern times. This paper analyses these phenomena and discusses\ntheir implications.\nTheobjective was to develop a scientiﬁcally based understanding\nof the probable behaviour of airborne respired blood aerosols and\nwhether, ornot, theobservedamountanddistributionofbloodspots\non clothing of a murder suspect could possibly be the result of\nrespired blood as opposed to impact spattered blood [1–6]. We have\nbeen unable to ﬁnd any clear explanations in the forensic science\nliterature or textbooks which provided a reliable scientiﬁcally based\ndescription of the processes involved in creating respired blood\naerosols from the nose or mouth, or indeed puncture wounds to the\nchest, of the physical mechanisms underlying their ﬂight char-\nacteristics, or how spots of respired blood captured on clothing\nmight be distinguished from, or confused with, spots originating\nfrom other sources, particularly impact spatter.\nA number of simple human and physical model experiments\nwere undertaken that could be considered to be a reasonable\nrepresentation of real situations. Studies were performed that\ncould relate to the expulsion of blood from the nose or mouth by\nthe conscious action of a subject, or be\ncaused to occur\ninvoluntarily by a subject, alive or dead. It is appreciated that\nthe studies reported here may be of relevance, not only to respired\naerosols via the nose or mouth, but, to the production and fate of\nblood aerosols derived from expiration of air via puncture wounds\nto the upper airway, trachea or chest [7,8].\nIn this paper, we consider ﬁrst the experimental studies we\nundertook and then relate these to the known physical processes\nrelating to airﬂow generated aerosols. Whilst the experimental\nstudies demonstrate that exhaled aerosols can potentially travel\ndistances in excess of 1 m, the general question of their motion\nover greater distances was not explored; this was because the\nﬂight characteristics are strongly dependent on the exhalation\nairﬂow properties and these are can vary greatly. A deﬁnitive study\nof the motion to greater distances would involve a considerable\nresearch project in its own right, beyond the scope of the principal\nfocus of the present work.\nForensic Science International 204 (2011) 144–155\nA R T I C L E\nI N F O\nArticle history:\nReceived 3 August 2009\nReceived in revised form 13 January 2010\nAccepted 24 May 2010\nAvailable online 18 June 2010\nKeywords:\nRespired blood spatter\nRespirated blood droplet size\nBlood pattern analysis\nExhaled blood aerosol transport\nChest stab wounds\nA B S T R A C T\nThe nature of blood aerosols produced in physiological studies of an upright subject expiring small\nvolumes through straws, spitting and mouthing sounds, and a semi-prone subject spitting through a\nbloody mouth or snorting through a single nasal oriﬁce and by a simpliﬁed physical model of the\nrespiratory system were investigated.

Subsequently, the A4 papers containing the simulated \nbloodstains were removed, air-dried and collected. The aforementioned \nprocedure was repeated 20 times, with the A4 printing paper being \nreplaced on the screen each time. Once the initial set of experiments had \nbeen completed, the experimental table was relocated, and the distance \nbetween the center of the polypropylene board and the screen was \nadjusted to 50 cm and 100 cm, respectively, for the subsequent repeti­\ntions of the experiment.\n2.3. Fly spots simulation experiment\nA domestic pig carcass (29.6 kg, Fig. 2) was obtained from a local \nmarket, slaughtered by the butcher, and subsequently frozen and \ntransported to the laboratory. Once the carcass had been fully thawed, it \nwas placed on plastic trays in the woods on the campus of the Southwest \nUniversity of Political Science and Law to attract necrophilous flies for \negg-laying. The plastic trays were then covered with vermiculite for the \nlarvae to pupate. Upon the departure of the third instar larvae from their \nfood sources for pupation, the fly pupae were harvested from the \nvermiculite. The most common necrophilous flies in the region during \nthe spring, summer, and fall were filtered from pupae for this study: \nChrysomya megacephala (Fabricius, 1794), Chrysomya pinguis (Walker, \n1858), and Achoetandrus rufifacies (Macquart, 1843) [26]. In the present \nstudy, the authors primarily employed the taxonomic identification \ncriteria from the Key to the Common Flies of China [27] to identify the \nspecies. The pupae were evenly mixed and divided into two equal por­\ntions, which were then placed in two fly-rearing cages. Blank A4 \nprinting papers were spread all over the bottom of the fly-rearing cages \n(130 × 60 cm × 60 cm, Fig. 3). Once the adult flies had emerged, dishes \nof milk and fake theatrical blood were placed into the cages. The feed \nwas replenished every two days, while the A4 paper lining the bottom of \nthe cages was collected and replaced until all the flies within the cages \nhad died.\n2.4. Image acquisition and processing\nThe A4 papers containing simulated impact spatters and fly spots \nfrom the aforementioned experiments were scanned with an Epson \nL6178 multifunction printer at a resolution of 600 dpi. To prevent \nmisclassification by the modified ResNet model due to color intensity \nfluctuations caused by adding milk to fake theatrical blood for fly \nrearing, and to streamline the matrix while improving computational \nperformance, all images were converted to grayscale and stored in TIFF \nformat. This study aims to distinguish between fly spots and impact \nspatters, which are challenging to identify with the naked eye. Due to \nthe limitations of the employed model, automatic localization of indi­\nvidual stains within the image was not feasible, necessitating manual \ncropping. In the preliminary analysis, we examined the imaginal body \nlengths of three fly species selected for the fly spots simulation experi­\nment. The maximum imaginal body length among the specimens did not \nexceed 12.60 mm. Therefore, stains larger than 12.60 mm in diameter \nwere excluded from the analysis. Additionally, this study manually \nscreened the impact spatters generated in the simulation to exclude \nthose with significant morphological differences from fly spots. When \nusing Adobe Photoshop 2021 to process the collected grayscale blood­\nstain images, we conducted a series of tests to optimally display the \nmorphological characteristics of each bloodstain. We determined that a \n600 × 600 pixels cropping frame was ideal for standardizing image \ncropping. This step utilized the batch processing function in Adobe \nPhotoshop 2021 to ensure consistency and efficiency in image \nprocessing.\n2.5. Image recognition\nThe overall structure of the convolutional neural network is depicted \nin Fig. 4. ResNet-18 is a neural network model that we utilized to \nidentify various aspects in bloodstain photos. With 17 layers devoted to \nextracting different details from the images and one final output layer, \nthis network operates similarly to a multi-layered image processing \nsystem. By separating distinct \"bits of information\" from the image, each \nlayer enables the computer to progressively \"understand\" the material. A \n\"batch normalization\" step, which helps stabilize the data as it passes \nbetween layers, and many image-processing layers (convolutions) make \nup each of the \"residual blocks\" that make up the ResNet-18 model. \nFurthermore, each block contains \"shortcut connections\" that allow data \nto bypass specific layers if necessary. This characteristic keeps infor­\nmation from \"vanishing\" as it moves through deeper layers, which is a \ncommon issue in complicated networks. By the time the information \nreaches the network’s deeper layers, the feature maps (data represen­\ntations) grow smaller but more sophisticated, allowing the model to \nmake correct classifications. In the last stage, all of the learnt features \nare combined using a \"average pooling\" method, and the classification \nresults are obtained via a fully connected output layer with two \nFig. 1.

Drop impacts experiments\nAs described in Table 2, the drop impact experiments are\nconducted on glass, cardstock (Colorbok, textured white cardstock),\npolycarbonate and aluminum surfaces, which represent a range of\nnon-absorbing surfaces. Several values of surface roughness for\npolycarbonate and aluminum surfaces are obtained after grinding\nwith sand paper and subsequent rinsing with isopropanol and\ndeionized water. Then, to dry the targets, the aluminum surfaces are\nwiped with clean tissue, while only compressed air is used for\npolycarbonate to prevent the formation of static charge on the\nsurface.\nSurface roughness of the targets is measured using a 3D\nmicroscope (Hirox, Digital Microscope, KH-8700). The static\ncontact angle of the blood drops, on the targets, is measured\nusing ImageJ software [24]. A syringe pump (KD Scientiﬁc,\nKDS230) is used to create blood droplets, through FEP tubing\nand a 27 gauge blunt needle (corresponding to an average droplet\ndiameter of 2.47 mm, and a volume of 7.89 mL), as shown in\nFig. 3. Within 70% population interval, the uncertainty on the\nmeasured droplet diameter is 3.1%, and 6.2% for impact velocity.\nBlood is a complex ﬂuid and the following handling precautions\nhave been useful to reduce experimental uncertainties. The blood\nis continuously pumped (at 0.1 ml/min), without stopping, to\nprevent its drying at the needle outlet; drying of blood at the\nneedle outlet has been observed to modify drop diameter over\ntime. Correspondingly, a droplet is generated every 5 s. A small\ncontainer was placed under the needle to collect redundant\ndroplets generated between each trial of experiment. Droplet\nimpact velocity is altered by changing the droplet release height (5,\n10, 20, 60 and 150 cm). At each height, the needle is replaced to\nensure consistent nozzle condition. The targets are blown with\ncompressed air just before the start of the experiments to remove\nany residual dust particles. Series of 10 blood stains are created on\neach surface, at each height, to ensure repeatability of results. A\nhigh speed camera (Redlake MotionXtra HG-100 K) is used to\nrecord the droplet impact, while the dripping rate is kept constant.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe representative sequence of events during droplet impact\nand spreading on different targets is shown in Fig. 4. When the\ndroplet impacts normally on the surface, its inertia drives the liquid\nradially outwards, and this expansion is opposed by viscous\ndissipation in the blood and by surface tension at the blood–air\ninterface. At t = 2 ms, the droplet stretches the blood into a thin\nlayer called lamella, surrounded by a peripheral thicker ring called\nthe rim. About 3 ms after the impact, as the inertial forces weaken,\nthe droplet reaches a maximum spreading, whereafter capillary and\nviscous forces dominate. The liquid in the rim is brought back by\nsurface tension toward the vertical axis of symmetry. This recoiling\nphase\noccurs\nfor\n3 ms < t < 20 ms,\nand\ncorresponds\nto\nthe\ndissipation of the inertial forces by viscous forces. That phase\noccurs with contact line pinned to the target[7,11,25], except on\nglass as observed in Fig. 4. After the instance of maximum spreading\n(image (iv) in Fig. 4), the contact line remains pinned for the\naluminium, cardstock and polycarbonate targets, while the contact\nline on the glass target spreads further: this is attributed to the\n[(Fig._2)TD$FIG]\nFig. 2.

    "text_chunk": "The simplest parameter to characterize the spreading is the spread\nfactor dmax/d0, i.e. the ratio of the maximum contact diameter over\nthe initial drop diameter. The spread factor has been estimated\nusing ﬁrst-order FD models [13,112–114]. These models compare\nthe various energy terms available before impact (potential,\nsurface, \nkinetic) \nwith energy \nterms available after impact,\nconsidering that some of the impact energy has been dissipated\nby e.g. viscous forces. Since spreading is typically driven by inertia\nand gravity and resisted by surface tension and viscous forces, the\nspread factor can be estimated with a relation of the kind, dmax/\nd0 = f(Re, We, Fr), with the dimensionless numbers deﬁned as in\nTable 2. Arguing that in several cases relevant to BPA, We >> Re\nand neglecting the effect of gravity during the impact, Chandra’s\ngroup proposed the correlation [114]\ndmax\nd0\nﬃ1\n2 Re1=4: \n(8)\nRelations developed with a similar approach are also in\n[11,115].\nBy itself, the description of Eq. (8) is of limited use in BPA\nbecause the initial diameter of a drop is rarely known; however,\nthe combined measurement of spreading and spines (below) can\nhelp estimate the impact conditions.\nWhen the impact energy is large enough, the edge of round stains\nare no longer smooth, but rather disturbed by spines – also called\nﬁngers, scallops, sunburst effect [116] or spikes – as shown in Fig. 9a.\nSpines appear in increasing number as the impact velocity increases\n[42]. The instability mechanism responsible for the formation of\nthese spines has only been investigated recently. Marmanis and\nThoroddsen [117] developed a correlation between the impact\nReynolds number and the number of ﬁngers, N, and attributed the\nﬁngering to interactions between inertial and viscous forces, see also\n[118]. Recently, Hulse-Smith et al. [114] proposed a correlation\ndependent on a target-speciﬁc empirical coefﬁcient, C \u0004 O(1), and on\nthe Weber number, i.e. the ratio of inertial forces (that enhance\nﬁngering) to the surface forces (that reduce ﬁngering), where\nN ¼ C\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nWe\np\n: \n(9)\nReference [114] proposes to combine Eqs. (8) and (9) to\ndetermine d0 and v0 based on the measurement of the stain size\ndmax and of the number of spines N, assuming that the material\nproperties of the blood (r, m, and s) and of the target material (C)\nare known. That approach to determine the impact conditions from\nthe inspection of a stain is known as the method of spines. A derived\napproach, independent of the physical properties of the blood, is\ndescribed in [107] for impacts on paper, drywall and wood. Spines\ncan merge or be indistinguishable from oscillations on the edge of\nthe stain due to local changes of substrate roughness or wettability.\nAs a result, there is an inherent subjectivity in determining the\nnumber of spines, leading to recommendation in Hulse-Smith and\nIlles [107] that only one individual count all the spines related to a\nspeciﬁc BPA study. In [14], Adam also mentions two limits of\napplicability of the method of spines: the absence of spines for low-\nenergy impacts and the saturation of the number of spines at high\nWeber numbers, see Fig. 9b.\nThe occurrence of splashing –the breakup of the drop into\ndistinct amounts of liquid upon impact- can be explained in\nrelation to the formation of spines. Since the formation of the\nspines is driven by inertia and resisted by capillary and viscous\nforces, three regimes can be identiﬁed in a Re–We plane (or in a v0–\nd0) plane. When the ratio of inertia over capillary and viscous\nforces is low, the drop spreads without scallops nor spines.\nWhen that ratio becomes larger, the edge of the stain exhibits\nspines. When that ratio becomes critically large, instabilities grow\nto the point of breakup and splashing [118]. Quantitative criteria to\ndiscriminate between these three regions are described in [14].\nRegarding the inﬂuence of the target, as documented by\nBalthazard et al. [42], its shape, material, preparation, structure\nand oxidation inﬂuence the spreading of drops, the formation of\nspines and of stains. Since most blood drop impact studies have\nbeen made on paper, the corresponding published BPA literature is\nonly valid for impacts on paper targets. For instance, Balthazard\net al. mention [42] that their results are only valid for impact on a\nspeciﬁc type of cardboard paper. In [4,119], MacDonell writes\nabout how the substrate roughness can increase spatter, i.e.\npromote splashing. Studies [89,114] compare blood drop impact\non different substrates (glass, paper, steel and wood), with\ndifferent roughness. Note also that a speciﬁc class of target\nsurfaces is of speciﬁc importance for BPA: clothes [120].\nA large set of high-speed visualization experiments of normal and\noblique impacts on various substrates, at various speeds, is available,\nwith the techniques and from the sources mentioned in Section 3.1.\nTwo questionable assumptions sometimes appear in BPA reports\non the impact of drops:\nFig. 9.

By these techniques positive results \ncan be obtained in approximately \n40-90% of the cases with variations \ndependent \non the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of \ncharacteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand can contribute \nto the preliminary \nrecon- \nstruction \nof the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- \ntance. In previous \nstudies different \nresults concerning \nvisible \nshot residues, in \nparticular \non the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency \nof characteristic \nsigns on the shooting \nhand are very rare. In the old German \nforensic literature, \nBriining \nand Wiethold \n[l] detected blood spatters on the hand \nonly ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 \n(57%) selected cases biological \ntraces on or in the barrel of the weapon used.

Bet: et al. /Forensic \nScience International \n76 (1995) 47-53 \n51 \nStrassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic \nsigns in or on the weapon in \n‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Whereas the central part of the drop and the ﬁne\nperiphery stick onto the glass plate due to the absence of RBCs, the corona is where\nmobile deposits form and these do not adhere to the substrate. The explanation of\nthis wetting phenomenon lies in the proteins which exist on the RBCs (glycoproteins).\nThe function of these proteins is to avoid wettability with a wall and, in particular,\nthe internal wall of organs, veins.\nAt the beginning of drop evaporation, the ﬂuid is homogeneous in colloids, this is\nwhy a thin periphery can dry on the glass plate. However, since Marangoni convection\nis occurring, the RBCs (and other heavy colloids) accumulate at the drop triple line,\nwhich is receding.

Droplets were produced from a series of conical nozzles,\nmanufactured with a range of cone angles and including a set of un-bored conical tips, under conditions\nwhere the tip was either non-wetted or pre-wetted with blood. For the former, radius-limited case,\ndetached droplet volumes were found to agree well with the predictions of both the pendent drop weight\nand drop shape models. For pre-wetted tips, droplet volumes were found to increase with increasing\ncone angle and to be independent of whether the blood ﬂow was through an oriﬁce at the tip or across the\ntip surface itself for un-bored tips. Such angle-limited, detached droplet volumes were predicted well by\napplying the same contact angle correction factor as for a ﬂat surface. The maximum droplet volume,\nformed from a horizontal ﬂat surface, was found to be around 150 mL for horse blood. Similar theoretical\napproaches were then extended to droplets released under centrifugal force appropriate to swing cast-off\nactivity and evaluated using previously published experimental data. Order of magnitude agreement for\ndroplet diameters was fairly good but, more importantly, these were found to be proportional to the\ninverse of the tangential velocity thereby supporting a model where the blood droplet is released directly\nfrom a blood mass itself, such as a ligament, rather than from being pinned to some surface feature or\noriﬁce on the weapon. This work provides a sound theoretical and experimental understanding of blood\ndroplet release under these conditions that can underpin both future research and the interpretation of\nblood evidence in case-work.\n© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nOver recent years there have been many published studies\nexploring the science underpinning bloodstain pattern analysis.\nAmongst this literature, many of these [1–9] have focused on the\ndynamics of blood droplets, surface impact and stain formation,\nincluding impact angle and surface texture effects, whilst others\nhave investigated \npattern \nformation \nitself, \nfor \nexample \nby\nanalysing droplet trajectories and the methodologies used in\ncase-work examination and interpretation [10–15]. In contrast,\nthere are fewer examples where the initial formation of the blood\ndroplets themselves has been studied, for example on weapon tips,\nand speciﬁcally the factors which govern the volume of the droplet\nreleased whether under passive (drip from a static source) or active\n(for example, from swing cast-off) conditions [16–18]. Studies of\nthese factors, for the most part, have focused on experimental\ninvestigations rather than exploration of the theoretical basis for\ndroplet formation and the veriﬁcation of such mathematical\nmodels against those experimental data.\nThis present work was designed to ﬁll this gap in the literature\nby reviewing and developing current understanding of the\nmechanisms underpinning the formation and adhesion of blood\ndroplets at oriﬁces and on surfaces – the pendent drop – and the\nconditions under which droplets are released, either under gravity\nalone or under the centrifugal force generated during swing cast-\noff. To test and evaluate such a quantitative, theoretical approach, a\nseries of experiments was carried out to obtain data on the\nrelationship between the size, shape and properties of the oriﬁce\nor surface and the volume of blood droplets formed on passive\nrelease. This was achieved by using bored and un-bored conical\nbrass tips machined at a variety of angles as models for weapon tips\nof differing sharpness. In this study particular attention was paid to\nthe degree of wetting of the surface by the blood and the\nconsequent size of the detached droplet. In addition, quantitative\ndata already published, from model swing cast-off studies [12,16],\nhas been used in a similar fashion to evaluate mathematical\nmodels for the active release of blood droplets.\nE-mail address: c.d.adam@keele.ac.uk (C.D.

With this in mind, the larger droplets within the high-\nspeed images were found to be >0.8 mm diameter and traveling\n<3 m⁄sec. Therefore, ignoring drag is expected to introduce no\nmore than 30% error in predicting the z-coordinate in this experi-\nment. This is quite substantial and highlights that any attempt to\nincorporate projectile motion into AO modeling must take drag into\naccount.\nAO error associated with size and xy-coordinate was calculated\nusing the stain triangulation lines at the point with which they\ncrossed the known x-axis, which runs perpendicular to the spatter\nflight direction. For each spatter pattern, the xy-coordinate was\nmeasured as the average offset between each triangulation line and\nthe known xy-coordinate, while AO size was measured as the 95%\nconfidence interval of this average. These calculations are presented\nin Fig. 12.\nNo statistically significant correlations were found between the\nobserved errors, and blood volumes and velocities tested. XY-coor-\ndinates were found to be quite accurate, with the least accurate\nspatter pattern deviating from the known xy-coordinate by only\n4 mm. On the other hand, the AO size was found to be larger than\nexpected. The known blood droplet diameters tested were 2.7 and\n3.2 mm, while the calculated sizes ranged between 7.8 and\n14.3 mm, representing a two- to fivefold increase. Further analysis\nof these results revealed a number of outliers present within each\ntrial. This was investigated further.\nOne of the 24 spatter patterns was selected randomly for addi-\ntional analysis. The stain selection criteria were lowered to include\nstains that could provide a measure of directionality only. This\nresulted in the selection of 54 stains. For the purpose of this analy-\nsis, instead of starting at each stain and triangulating ‘‘backward,’’\nthe known xy-position was used as the starting point and lines were\ndrawn ‘‘forward’’ out to each stain. Where each line overlapped the\ncorresponding stain, the rotational offset could then be evaluated.\nOf these 54 stains, the rotational offsets of 14 (26%) were signifi-\ncant enough that it was reasonable to assume that any individual\ntasked with fitting an ellipse to a bloodstain was unlikely to have\narrived at the same triangulation line. Four of these representative\nstains are shown in Fig. 13 each with their corresponding triangula-\ntion path originating from the known xy-coordinate. This finding\nclearly demonstrates that a component of AO error is not related to\nanalyst measurement but is instead inherent in the process of blood\ndisplacement and disintegration.\nPostimpact droplet formation is the most likely mechanism for\nthis contribution to AO size error. This ‘‘fork in the road’’ effect\noccurs when a blood volume structure (sheet, filament, or large\ndroplet) has traveled a certain distance from the AO and reaches\nan instability threshold where it disintegrates into smaller volumes.\nSubsequently, trajectory lines for these respective bloodstains will\ntriangulate back to this fork in the road where secondary disintegra-\ntion occurred, instead of back to the true AO. Given that this\nexperiment was designed to reduce the complexity of droplet disin-\ntegration, it is likely that this will be more predominant under\nbloodshed conditions more typically associated with crime scenes.\nConclusion\nSmall volumes of blood were disintegrated through the applica-\ntion of pressurized air. The resulting spatter patterns were used to\nevaluate BPA AO error and investigate the underlying mechanisms.\nUnder these experimental conditions, z-coordinate predictions were\nconsistently overestimated by an average of 50%, while using the\nlowest z-coordinate within a spatter pattern reduced this error to\n8%. However, if this value is to be reported, it should be presented\nas an estimate and not as a maximum height calculation. Incorpora-\ntion of projectile motion into z-coordinate calculations was found\nto underestimate by an average of 28%, while velocity predictions\nwere found to be quite accurate when compared with the high-\nspeed photographs. However, the application of projectile motion is\nlimited at this time as an assumption related to launch angle was\nrequired,\nand\nthe\nimpact\nof\ndrag\ncould\nnot\nbe\nignored.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nvelocity (m/sec)\nerror (%)\nD = 0.2mm\nD = 0.4mm\nD = 0.6mm D = 0.8mm\nD = 1.0mm\nD = 1.2mm\nD = 1.4mm\nD = 1.6mm\nFIG. 11—Effect of drag forces on blood droplets between 0.2 and 1.6 mm\nin diameter, traveling up to 10 m ⁄ sec.

A panel of\nexperienced bloodstain pattern analysts examined over 400 spatter patterns on three rigid non-absorbent surfaces. The patterns varied in spatter\ntype and extent. A case summary accompanied each pattern that either contained neutral information, information to suggest the correct pattern\n(i.e., was positively biasing), or information to suggest an incorrect pattern (i.e., was negatively biasing). Across the variables under examina-\ntion, 13% of classifications were erroneous. Generally speaking, where the pattern was more difficult to recognize (e.g., limited staining extent\nor a patterned substrate), analysts became more conservative in their judgment, opting to be inconclusive. Incorrect classifications increased as\na function of the negatively biasing contextual information. The implications of the findings for practice are discussed.\nKEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, error rate, reliability, contextual bias, cognitive science\nBloodstains are a common by-product of violent crime, and\nanalysis of these stains is a vital part of a crime scene investiga-\ntion. Despite the fact that DNA analysis can now routinely iden-\ntify the individuals that have bled at a scene, other important\nquestions can remain unanswered. For example, it is not uncom-\nmon for a suspect to claim that the blood found on his/her cloth-\ning was deposited when he/she was trying to aid the victim. In\nthese situations, understanding the mechanism by which the\nstains were deposited onto an article of clothing could be more\ninformative than knowing from whom the blood originated. This\nis where the analysis of bloodstain patterns can often give valu-\nable clues as to how the blood came to be where it was found.\nAlthough the dynamics of the formation of a bloodstain pat-\ntern appear to be infinitely variable, it is nevertheless true that\nbloodstain patterns have reproducible characteristics that allow a\nconnection to be made between the distribution of bloodstains\nand the underlying mechanism of their formation. Thus, at the\nheart of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the recognition and\nclassification of the bloodstain pattern.\nBPA has been used in criminal investigations since the 1800s.\nLike many other disciplines from the early days of forensic\nscience, its use and acceptance occurred without rigorous valida-\ntion. The Organization of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC)\nBPA Subcommittee (previously the Scientific Working Group\non Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN)) has made valu-\nable progress in setting standards for training and education, ter-\nminology, quality assurance, and validation of new procedures\nfor the discipline (1–3). Like other forensic practitioners, how-\never, bloodstain pattern analysts are grappling with the problem\nof assessing the reliability of the methodology that they use. At\nthis time, very little is known about this beyond the instincts of\nexperienced instructors and investigators who have observed the\nreproducibility of bloodstain patterns over many crime scenes\nand practical sessions in the classroom. While such experience\nhas served as the main basis for assessing the reliability of BPA\ntestimony in the past, the courts now rightly demand much\nmore. Indeed, establishing accuracy and reliability measures in\nforensic disciplines was a key recommendation in the National\nResearch Council’s 2009 (4) report on the state of forensic\nscience.\nThere are several factors that may influence the reliability of\nbloodstain pattern classifications. First, different bloodletting\nmechanisms can give rise to bloodstain patterns that possess\nsimilar or indistinguishable characteristics. For example blunt\nforce impact and expiration patterns (2) can both feature small\nbloodstains and as such may be confused with one another. Sec-\nond, at times, a pattern might only comprise one, or a small\nnumber of stains, meaning an analyst must decide if he/she has\nsufficient data to make a reliable classification.

Additionally, a small soot cavity could be sounded\ntowards the upper right part of the defect.\nOn the left temple, an irregular galea defect with matching\nwound rims could be detected.

Backspatter\nThe droplets were predominantly distributed on the extensor\nside of the ﬁngers and the radial aspect of the hands. Several\nelongated droplets in the shape of ‘exclamation marks’ found on\nthe middle joint of the right index ﬁnger pointed approximately\ntowards the ﬁngertip. Similar, parallel patterns were detected on\nthe base joint, mostly with the same direction. Individual droplets\nat the inner part of the index ﬁnger were aligned towards the palm\nof the hand (Figs. 5 and 6). Additionally, round blood spatters were\nsituated on the ulnar side of the index ﬁnger as well as on the back\nof the hand.\nThe left hand showed round microspatter at the extensor side of\nthe thumb and index ﬁnger (Fig. 7). The palm of the hands showed\nno bloodstains.\n5. Discussion\nIn order to be able to reconstruct the events at a crime scene,\nforensic investigators study the shapes, sizes and distribution of\nbloodstains. Together with autopsy ﬁndings about injuries, a\nmedically and scientiﬁcally based reconstruction of possible\nwounding mechanisms is possible [5].\nBased primarily on the characteristics and location of the\nentrance wound and direction of bullet path, the presented case\nwould be classiﬁed as a suicide. [6] However, the ﬁnal position of\nthe weapon on the left side of the body in relation to the entrance\nwound on the right side of the head and intensive bloodstains on\nthe weapon and body was the cause of speculation about the\ncorrectness of this primary assumption.\nIn most cases, blood spatter on the hands of a victim or a\ndefendant are usually neglected in favour of those found at the\ncrime scene. Nevertheless, several publications show that the\nanalysis of backspatter is an important tool for mathematical and\nphysical modelling of blood spatter and thus enables the\nreconstruction of the gun’s position and the manner in which it\nhas been used [7–9].\nIn the case at hand, parallel bloodstains on the back of the right\nhand, thumb and index ﬁnger together with the discreetly visible\nstains on the extensor side of left thumb and index ﬁnger suggest\nthat the back of the right hand was directed away from the area of\norigin. Backspatter on the dorsal part of the thumb and index ﬁnger\nindicates that the blood was projected away from the wrist in an\noblique angle towards the inner part of the ﬁngers and palm of the\nhand and towards the ﬁngertips. Taking into account the fact that\nthe palm of the right hand was free from spatter, the weapon must\nhave been held backwards in the right hand with the right thumb\nembracing the trigger (Fig. 8a and b). This reconstruction is\nsupported by the extensive bloodstains on the index ﬁnger, as it is\nthe most prominent part at this precise position, facing away from\nFig. 1.

Recently, Stone supported this view \nand described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers \nand 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic \nsigns on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli \n[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot \nfatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the \ncases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed \nin 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by \nrevolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, \nReed [6] observed \nblood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether \nblood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted \nas a \ncharacteristic \nsign of the shooting hand, were detected. \nIn our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as \ndescribed by Zwingli \n[13], could not be obtained. \nVisible powder soilings were \nfound on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) \nbut blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which \ncharacteristic \nsigns were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. \nA further \ndifferentiation \nof the frequency \nof positive \nresults dependent on the \ncalibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood \nspatters in cases of increased calibres in particular \nof pistols. Since the gas pressure \nfollowing \nthe discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development \nof back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can \neasily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger \ncalibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency \ncould not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively \nsmall number of cases. \nThe (surprising) \nobservation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge \nof 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum \ncould be \nexplained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 \nMagnum \nrevolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. \nThe rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as \nanother characteristic \nsign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, \nof relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - \npistols - \nrifles/shotguns’, \ncan probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, \nwhereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. \nThere- \nfore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that \nof blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently \nfollowing \nchemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating \ntheir importance for a conclusive \ndiagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of \nvisible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood \nspatters, already contribute \nto the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- \nable number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable \ninformation. \nFurthermore, \nthe detection of these characteristic \nsigns supports the \nconclusions \ndrawn from the investigation \nof the entrance wounds showing typical \nfeatures of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding \nthe charac- \nteristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination \nwith a muzzle impression.

Earlier research has applied image \nprocessing techniques to the analysis of digital images of bloodstains to \nautomatically fit ellipses to the bloodstain shape and determine the \nimpact angle and orientation angle from the minor and major axes. \nHowever, the described methodologies were applied to images of single \nbloodstains [13–15] or the procedure required input from the analyst to \nselect the appropriate stains within a pattern [16,17]. More recently, \nresearchers have utilised the quantitative techniques of Matlab [18–20]\nor ImageJ [21–23] to the analysis of digital images of bloodstain pat­\nterns. While both methods can easily extract the number of stains and \ngive a measurement regarding their size, other BPA specific metrics are \nnot available such as the directionality of the stain (represented \nnumerically as the gamma angle), and the impact angle.\n1.1. Gamma and impact angles\nWhen a droplet lands on a target at an angle, the resultant stain is \nelliptical with the major (long) axis in alignment with the direction of \ntravel. Furthermore, as the blood droplet collapses and spreads across \nthe target a volume of the liquid can form a small wave that follows the \ndirection of travel of the droplet. This wave can spill over from the \ncontact line (the edge of the blood in the main parent stain) resulting in \nthin protrusions extending from the end of the parent elliptical stain \n[24]. Depending on the angle, droplet size and surface features, the \nprotrusions can be single (referred as a tail), multiple (referred to as \nspines) and/or fully detach from the parent stain (see Fig. 1). The \npresence of these tails or spines on one side of an elliptical stain is \nconsidered a reliable indicator for the direction of travel along the major \naxis, and by combining the orientation angle with the direction, the \ngamma angle can be determined. For example, a stain on a 45-degree \nangle with a right direction will have a gamma angle of 45 degrees. \nHowever, if the same stain’s directionality was left the gamma angle \nwould be 225 degrees (see Fig. 2) [1].\nWhilst the gamma angle can give information about the general di­\nrection a blood drop was travelling, the trajectory of the droplet can be \nestimated by including information on the angle the droplet impacted a \ntarget surface. It has been previously demonstrated that there is a rela­\ntionship between the width to length ratio of an elliptical stain and the \nangle of impact (α) of the droplet to the target. Perpendicular impacts \nresult in circular stains, more oblique angles result in more elongated \nelliptical stains. This relationship is shown in Eq.1 [25]. \nα = arcsin Width\nLength\n(1) \nAn accurate impact angle estimation relies on an accurate width and \nlength measurement. One of the challenges faced by BPA analysts is \naccurately measuring the elliptical shape of the parent stain when the \ntails and spines lengthen the final stain. Analysts are trained to ignore \nthese protrusions when estimating the length of the ellipse [26]. By \ncombining the estimated impact and gamma angles a straight-line tra­\njectory of the droplet can be determined. It is noted that the other \ninfluencing forces such as gravity and drag are ignored during this \nestimation.\nDetermining these angles for various stains can assist with grouping \nstains together as part of the same pattern/event and also can be used to \nlimit the positions of the blood source within a geometric space and \ntherefore assist with reconstruction of events at a scene. Most analysis at \ncrime scenes is still undertaken manually and each spatter pattern can \ncontain hundreds to thousands of stains. So, whilst the gamma and \nimpact angles are considered important features there is currently \nneither the time nor the resources to collect data on every individual \nstain.\nIn 2017 image processing techniques were applied to develop a \nmethodology that can automatically extract bloodstain pattern features \nfrom digital images [18]. Using Matlab R2015B the digital image of an \nimpact pattern was imported, the background subtracted, and the ob­\njects of interest (stains) segmented using the Triangle thresholding al­\ngorithm. To overcome the challenge of fitting accurate ellipses to stains \nwith spines, the researchers applied erosion and dilation morphological \noperations to remove small protrusions and background noise. Stains \ngreater than 10 pixels in both the original binarised image and the \neroded/dilated image were then mapped, linked and relevant mea­\nsurements computed using Matlab regionprops [18]. In this research the \ndirection of the stains was determined by locating the centroid of the \nellipse from the eroded/dilated image within the bounding box of the \noriginal stain. This along with the orientation angle was used to calcu­\nlate the gamma angle. Other BPA specific features were also computed. \nThese included shape features of the individual stains (tail to body ratio, \nwidth to length ratio, area of stain to area of convex hull ratio (regularity \nmeasure), ratio of perimeter of inscribed circle to perimeter of stain, \nstain size and stain intensity. Five pattern features were also calculated: \noverall directionality, convergence, linearity, circularity of pattern, \nstain density.\nSubsequently this methodology was applied to a limited number of \nlaboratory generated impact and cast-off patterns [27] and the results \nanalysed. A combination of five of the above-described features were \nfound to be optimal for distinguishing between these two classes of \npatterns. Although demonstrating a promising approach to the appli­\ncation of an automated system to the analysis of spatter patterns, Matlab \nlicences are expensive and not all researchers and BPA analysts have \neasy access to this platform. Furthermore, the fixed thresholding values \ndid not work well when the methodology was applied to further labo­\nratory generated spatter patterns created in our research facilities and \nthe system was slow to analyse patterns with thousands of stains [28].\nWe present an Automated Bloodstain Pattern Analysis method \n(ABPA method) that improves on the previous methodology described \n[18], increasing the detection of the small stains present in the patterns, \nand computing more suitable BPA specific metrics that have been \ndeveloped based on the results of prior research [27,28] and on an un­\nderstanding of the fluid mechanics underpinning the formation of blood \nspatter patterns. This application has been implemented in Python, \nimporting modules including numpy, matplotlib, and Open CV for easy \nimplementation of image segmentation and analysis. Python has the \nbenefit of being a free open-source language that is readily available to \nresearchers, academics and analysts, making the method more acces­\nsible than Matlab.\n2.

    "text_chunk": "respectively. The impact velocities and terminal velocities in Fig. 4\nhave been integrated with respect to time using Eq. (1), with an\nexplicit discretization method that was tested for convergence.\nIn a plot such as Fig. 4, non-dimensional numbers are used in\nmany ways: ﬁrst the initial velocities (vertical axis) and impact\nvelocities (contours) are displayed as ratios relative to the terminal\nvelocity. This allows the presentation of a wide range of velocities\nin the same plot, more accurately than if velocities were plotted\ndimensionally. Also, the different physical regimes are best\nidentiﬁed with dimensionless numbers and correspond to speciﬁc\nregions indicated by squared numerals in Fig. 4. Let us show now\nhow these different physical regimes are related to the following\nquestions, fundamental for BPA studies.\nb1. Will the drop break into smaller drops? In ﬂight, breakup\noccurs when the aerodynamic force, i.e. the drag of the air on the\ndroplet, overcomes the surface forces at the droplet-air interface.\nIn-ﬂight breakup complicates the reconstruction of trajectories.\nThe larger the drop and the higher the velocity, the higher the\nchances that the drop breaks up during its ﬂight. To evaluate the\npossibility of breakup more rigorously, the aerodynamic drag force\nis compared with the surface force [35]. This comparison is\nexpressed with the dimensionless Weber number,\nWe ¼ rav2d\ns\n; \n(4)\nwhere ra, v, d, and s are the density of air, maximum velocity,\ndroplet diameter, and surface tension, respectively. Should We be\nsigniﬁcantly smaller than 1, the droplet travels without breaking\nup, because surface tension forces win over drag forces. Should We\nbe on the order of 1, the droplet will signiﬁcantly deform. At even\nlarger We, the deformation becomes so severe that the drop\ndisintegrates into smaller ones, when drag forces overcome surface\nforces. While the reasoning above is based on a dimensionless FD\nnumber, experiments are needed to determine the exact value of\nthe Weber number above which drop breaks up. As shown in\n[36,37], breakup typically occurs for We > 13, i.e. in the region\nabove the thick dotted line in Fig. 4, plotted for values of We = 13\nbased on the initial drop diameter and velocity. As a result, no\nimpact velocities are provided above that line, because the\nformalism exposed here cannot predict how in-ﬂight break-up\naffects the trajectory.\nb2. Will gravity forces signiﬁcantly modify the initial\nvelocity?\nThe question of the inﬂuence of the gravitational force on the\ntrajectories is important in BPA. If acceleration due to gravity is\nnegligible during the droplet’s ﬂight, there is no need to consider\ncurved trajectories. Gravity forces act all along the trajectory, but\ndo they signiﬁcantly modify the trajectory? For the speciﬁc case in\nFig. 4, gravity will signiﬁcantly modify the initial velocity if the\nwork of the gravity along the droplet path, Wg, is signiﬁcant with\nrespect to the initial kinetic energy of the drop Ek0. This comparison\nis expressed as the dimensionless number\nG ¼ Wg\nEk0\n; \n(5)\nand shown in Fig. 4, where a thick solid line delineates the region\nG > 0.1. To the left of that line, gravity forces will modify the initial\nvelocity signiﬁcantly, while to the right of that line, gravity forces\nwill not modify signiﬁcantly the initial velocity. An exact\nexpression of G is given in Appendix A.\nb3. Will the drag force signiﬁcantly affect the trajectory?\nThe question of the inﬂuence of the drag force on the\ntrajectories is important in BPA. If drag is negligible, then ballistic\ntrajectories can be calculated without accounting for the drag force\n–which is a complicated function of the drop velocity, see Eq. (3).\nIn layman’s terms, the question of interest is ‘‘Will the drag\nforces slow down the drop a lot or just a little bit?’’ To answer that\nquestion in FD terms, the work WD of the drag forces along the\nentire trajectory needs to be compared with the initial kinetic\nenergy of the drop, Ek0.\nThis comparison is expressed by the dimensionless number\nD ¼ WD=Ek0\n(6)\nShould D be signiﬁcant, then the work of drag forces will\nmodify the initial velocity signiﬁcantly. Should D be negligible,\nthen the drag forces will not modify signiﬁcantly the initial velocity\nTable 3\nSigniﬁcance of the physical regimes, shown as speciﬁc regions in Fig. 4.\nPhysical\nRegime\nPhysical signiﬁcance on the trajectory of a drop\n1 \nSigniﬁcant acceleration of droplet due to gravity forces, drag\nforces are signiﬁcant\n2 \nSigniﬁcant acceleration of droplet due to gravity, drag forces\nare insigniﬁcant\n3 \nMinor deceleration of droplet due to drag, gravity negligible\nwith respect to drag, but gravity signiﬁcant with respect to\ninitial kinetic energy\n4 \nDrag forces signiﬁcantly decelerate the drop; gravity negligible\nwith respect to drag, but gravity signiﬁcant with respect to\ninitial kinetic energy\n5 \nHigh probability that drop breaks up into smaller drops during\nﬂight, due to shear breakup\n6 \nMajor deceleration due to drag; gravity negligible with respect\nto initial kinetic energy\nFig. 4.

We connect points with\ncurves to easily observe the curvature information.\nFigure 10a illustrates that when fixed bins are used at the\nshort BT distance 30 cm, almost no bloodstains fall further\nthan bin 22. For BT distance 120 cm, there is a fair amount\nof bloodstains appearing in bin 22–30. BT distance has thus a\nsignificant impact on features with fixed bin size. Therefore,\nadaptive binning is used in Fig. 10b. The curves at BT dis-\ntances 30 and 120 cm are reshaped such that most bins con-\ntain at least a few bloodstains. In addition, the curves are\nsmoothed (especially for small BT distance), to facilitate the\ncomparison of derivatives over bins between gunshot and blunt\nimpact spatter patterns, as done in the section Shape of Curve\nOver Adaptive Bins.\nRectangular Bins—A different asymmetric definition of bins is\nto segregate the spatter pattern area into equal-size rectangular\nareas along the vertical direction. We define the random variable Z\nas the vertical distance between the bloodstain to the bottom of the\nspatter. Given n bloodstains, the observed vertical distances are\nZi; i ¼ 1; . . .n. The width of each rectangle is the same as the\nwidth of the spatter pattern and the length of rectangle is\n6\n40 median Z \u0002 median Z\nð Þ\nj\nj\nð\nÞ, where median Z \u0002 median Z\nð Þ\nj\nj\nð\nÞ is\nthe median absolute deviation of vertical distance (in z direction)\nbetween the bloodstain to the centroid. The total number of bins\nequals 40, and the factor 6 is chosen so that more than 81% of\nthe bloodstains are falling within a distance of 3 \u0007 median\nZ \u0002 median Z\nð Þ\nj\nj\nð\nÞ from the centroid in the vertical direction and\nare covered by rectangular bins (see Fig. 11). Both the lower side\nof rectangle 21 and the top side of rectangle 20 pass through the\ncentroid.\nConstruction of Local Features\nLocal features are typically constructed by defining features in\neach bin. These are called local features; comparison between\nbins helps describe how the features are spatially distributed\nwithin a given pattern. We illustrate the construction of local\nfeatures with the following example: the fraction of bloodstains\nwith diameter larger than 1 mm in each bin.\nFraction of Large Stains in Bins—The construction procedure is\nAlgorithm 1.\nAlthough it is difficult to classify spatter patterns at BT dis-\ntance 120 cm, for BT distances 30 and 60 cm, in bins with\nindex i 2 15; 16; . . .25\nf\ng, the fraction of large bloodstains of\ngunshot spatter patterns is significantly smaller than that of blunt\nimpact spatter patterns. The simple average of the fraction of\nbloodstains with diameter larger than 1 mm from bin 15 to 25 in\na spatter pattern is a new local feature, shown in Fig. 12b. The\nproposed feature is useful to classify impact from gunshot spatter\npatterns at BT distances 30 and 60 cm.\nFollowing this method, one can construct additional features\nby selecting different combinations of the set of bins, binning\nmethod, and averaging method (e.g., weighted average).\nShape of Stains in Bins—Our study found that shape measure-\nments in local features are proved relevant to classification, for\nexample, the average mean adjusted impact angle of the blood-\nstain over rectangle bin 27,. . ., 30 in Fig 15a.\nShape of Density Curve Over Adaptive Bins—Figure 13a shows\nthe error bar plots of the fraction of bloodstains in each adaptive\nbin for spatter patterns at BT distance 30 cm grouped by process\n(gunshot or blunt impact). We plot a curve connecting the points\nwhich are the mean fractions over 3 replicated spatter patterns,\nwith red and blue curves representing the blunt impact and gun-\nshot spatter patterns, respectively.\nTo smooth the data, we use local polynomial regression (37).\nConsider the data\nX1; Y1\nð\nÞ; . . .; Xn; Yn\nð\nÞ which form an indepen-\ndent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample from a population\n(X, Y), where Xi is the index of the ith adaptive bin, Yi is the\nfraction of bloodstains in ith adaptive bin, and n is the total\nnumber of bins. The local polynomial regression estimator in an\narbitrary point x is obtained by minimizing the following\nweighted least squares problem (37):\nFIG. 11––Rectangle bins.

The purpose of this study is to determine the \napproximate location of the blood source, i.e. the victim, at the crime scene by using an image processing and \nnumerical modeling approach. To achieve this, an experimental setup is designed with cardstocks and a cow \nblood-soaked sponge. In total, twenty forward spatter patterns are obtained onto cardstocks after successful \nshootings. In the post-processing phase, ellipses on the cardstocks are detected by processing the forward spatters \nin MATLAB. To achieve this, ellipse properties are identified for calculating the impact angles. The impact angles \nare then utilized as inputs to the tangent method within the program to estimate the Area of Origin (AOx). For \nvisualization, 2D and 3D images are generated. In conclusion, it is observed that the program works the best in \ndetermining the AOx, for the scenarios where the real AOx distances (blood source to target distances) are 35 cm, \n50 cm, and 100 cm respectively. The program’s weakness while determining AOx for the source distance of 5 cm \nis also reported. It is necessary to improve the program for short blood source-to-target distances and long \nshooting distances. It can be concluded that image quality is also a key factor for post-processing as it might \nmislead the results with visible ellipses.\n1. Introduction\nBloodstains are one of the most significant types of physical evidence \nand can greatly help to establish the connection between the culprit, the \nvictim, and the crime scene. The formation of the stains depends on \nphysical, environmental, and biological factors and can appear in \nvarious sizes and forms [1]. Patterns resulting from a force applied \ndirectly to the source of blood are referred to as impact spatter. Such \nspatters may be caused by firearms, blunt objects, stabbing, electrical \ndevices, or explosions [1]. The size of bloodstains is typically less than \n1 mm or larger, and the velocity of the applied force can start at 30 m/s. \nHowever, there is no direct correlation between stain size and the ve­\nlocity of the applied force [2]. By analyzing the spatter bloodstains, the \nfollowing questions can be answered regarding the crime scene: \n• Possible location and position of the culprit, the victim, and other \nobjects at the scene\n• Chronological order of events\n• Verification or refutation of statements made by the victim, wit­\nnesses, or culprit\nThere are a variety of software and algorithms developed in the \nliterature for the location of the blood source, i.e. Area of Origin (AO) \nestimation in bloodstain pattern analysis [3]. The aim of these methods \nis to estimate AO based on the size, shape and directionality of blood­\nstains. The string method is a well-known traditional method that uses \nphysical strings to determine the AO. This method is time-consuming, \nand its accuracy depends on the performer. Modern approaches use \nprimarily image processing and numerical modeling. The currently \navailable and most used programs include HemoSpat, Sherlock, Back­\nTrack, HemoVision, FARO Scene [3]. In the study by Arthur et al. \nMATLAB was used to analyze bloodstain patterns. Digital images were \nprocessed and basic features such as eccentricity, major and minor axis \nlengths, orientation, area and center of mass were calculated using the \nregionprops function. The methodology involved preparing digital im­\nages, isolating the bloodstains by applying segmentation and \n* Corresponding author at: Forensic Science Department, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Üsküdar University, ˙Icadiye, Ba˘glarbas¸ı Cd.

These studies try to cir-\ncumvent this problem by taking the number of spines, created around the stain, into account. However, \nrecently we showed that it is possible to determine the volume of a dried bloodstain and that it is possible \nto calculate the volume of the original droplet prior to impact8. Accordingly, we developed a method \nwhich can be used to determine the impact velocity based on the width of an elliptical bloodstain and its \noriginal volume9. In this study, we show for the first time that it is possible to determine the volume of \nbloodstains from a real impact pattern and infer the impact velocity of each stain chosen by the expert. \nMore importantly, we show that with this method we are able to take both gravity and drag into account \nwhen determining the trajectory of a blood droplet, and determine the region of origin of an impact \npattern much more precise and accurate than the methods currently in use. This research enables the \ninvestigator to determine the location of the blood source in the room, and connect it to the position \nof the victim (like standing or sitting), or connect specific wounds to certain patterns. To determine the \nregion of origin by taking gravity and drag into account, we require five parameters of each bloodstain: 1) \nlocation of the bloodstain in x, y, and z coordinates, 2) directional angle γ, 3) impact angle α, 4) volume \nof the original blood droplet, and 5) impact velocity of the blood droplet. The first parameter is trivial \nand measured easily, which is done for the current methods in use. The directional angle γ is measured \nby comparing the direction of travel to the vertical (Fig. 1b,c). The impact angle α can be determined \nfrom the shape of the stain as the width Wmax and length Lmax of the elliptical outline of the stain (Fig. 1c) \nare empirically related to the impact angle by sinα =  Wmax/Lmax\n10. It is possible to determine the volume \nof a bloodstain8, however this has never been done before with bloodstains of an impact pattern. We \nwill show that by means of a 3D surface scanner we can determine the volume of small (≈ 1 μl) blood-\nstains in a non-intrusive and objective manner (see supplementary materials). For the final parameter, \nthe impact velocity, recent studies for simple fluids suggest that it can be inferred from the maximum \ndiameter that an impacting drop of known volume attains5,9–13. During impact upon a surface, droplets \nspread in a circular fashion, where spreading is driven by inertial forces and countered by capillary and \nviscous forces9,14,15. These forces can be quantified in terms of the Weber number, We =  ρD0v2/σ, the ratio \nbetween the inertial and capillary force, and the Reynolds number Re =  ρD0v/η, the ratio between the \ninertial and viscous forces. Here ρ denotes the density of the fluid, D0 the diameter of the droplet in flight, \nv the impact velocity of the droplet, σ the surface tension and η the viscosity of the fluid. As spreading \nslows down, the spreading droplet reaches its maximum diameter, after which it can either retract due to \nthe capillary forces15 or remain pinned to the surface16, which is the case for blood droplets17. Recently, \nLaan et al.9 showed that spreading of droplets in general, including blood droplets, can be described by \nFigure 1.  Example of a bloodstain impact pattern with a detailed photograph of a single bloodstain. \n(a) Impact pattern created by means of a hammer on spring released into a volume of blood.
