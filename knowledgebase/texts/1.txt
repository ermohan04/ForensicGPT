This is a data set of blood spatter patterns scanned at high reso-
lution, generated in controlled experiments. The spatter patterns
were generated with a riﬂe or a handgun with varying ammuni-
tion. The resulting atomized blood droplets travelled opposite to
the bullet direction, generating a gunshot backspatter on a poster
board target sheet. Fresh blood with anticoagulants was used; its
hematocrit and temperature were measured. The main parameters
of the study were the bullet shape, size and speed, and the dis-
tance between the blood source and target sheet. Several other
parameters were explored in a less systematic way. This new and
original data set is suitable for training or research purposes in the
forensic discipline of bloodstain pattern analysis.

Type of data
Images of 68 backspatters from a gunshot, each in an individual folder
with text ﬁle listing the experimental conditions
How data was acquired
Blood spattered backward from a bullet impact, as described in the
manuscript. Spatters were collected on cardstock poster board, and
scanned with a ﬂatbed scanner
Data format
Images were scanned at 600 dots per inch (about 42.3 µm per pixel) and
saved as a .jpg with minimum compression (10% compression max)
Experimental factors
Spatter images with dimensions of maximum 1.36 m  1.1 m, scanned in
a piecewise manner and reassembled with image processing software
Experimental features
Blood volume of 2.5–175 mL was either contained in a closed cavity or
soaking a porous foam (sponge). Blood source was impacted normally by
a bullet travelling horizontally; bullet velocities ranged between 285 and
987 m/s. Horizontal distances between the vertical target and blood
source ranged from 10 cm to about 120 cm; fewer spatters on horizontal
targets. Muzzle gases have been screened out with a diffuser plate for
most spatters, to minimize their interaction with the backspatter;

Value of the data
 The data set can be used by researchers. One research purpose is to test crime scene reconstruction
models [1–3]. Brieﬂy, these models pursue at least two purposes. First, they classify patterns with
respect to their generation mechanism (e.g. beating vs. shooting [4]). Second, they determine the
region of origin of the blood spatter [5,6]. Recently, the US National Academies emphasized [7] the
need to develop more accurate bloodstain pattern analysis methods, with stronger ﬂuid dynamics
foundations. Accessibility to large amounts of bloodstain patterns produced under controlled
conditions is thus important for the development of the needed science base. The data in this
manuscript addresses the above issues by systematically documenting the experimental condi-
tions. Data of this manuscript can also inform studies investigating conditions for the presence of
spatter stains on the ﬁrearm or the shooter [8,9].
 The data helps dissemination of blood spatters for teaching and instructional purposes. Indeed,
generation and transport of blood spatters is cumbersome. A large space, the size of a habitation
room, is needed to generate a realistic blood spatter; and care should be taken to have reproducible
and realistic experimental conditions. Shooting comes with its own strict safety rules, and is best
done at an indoor shooting range to prevent draft from atmospheric winds. Blood sourcing and
handling is not trivial either. Blood needs to be used under strict safety conditions because of the
risk of blood-borne diseases and pathogens. Since travelling across borders is common for BPA
instructors, both alternatives of travelling with blood spatters through customs or having the blood
spatters prepared at the site and time of the workshop involve logistic efforts, costs and safety
risks. Also blood ages within days [10]. All the experiments here use blood drawn less than 3 days
before the experiment and spiked with anticoagulant. This database provides BPA instructors with
a safe set of spatters ready to be printed at high resolution for their classes.
 This data set is new and original, and the data has not been published elsewhere.
 The experimental design and methods described in this manuscript can be readily reproduced and
used to generate additional blood spatters. Note that there is still no consensus on which
experimental setup is best to simulate the complexity of gunshot spatters in realistic conditions,
where blood is located within a complex structure involving body tissues and blood vessels,

covered by skin. Head of calves have been used [11], a human cadaver ﬁlled with blood [12], foams
or sponges soaked in blood [4,13], or cavities ﬁlled with blood have been used [14]. Experiments
reported here used both soaked foams and cavities ﬁlled with blood as the blood source, and the
information on which blood source was used is speciﬁed.
1. Data
Blood spatters are a subset of bloodstain patterns, with stains generated when an impacting object
causes drops to go airborne [1–3] before hitting the surface of a solid object called the target. Gunshot
backspatters are spatters where blood is atomized by a bullet, in a direction opposite to that of the
bullet [2]. Discussion and physical description on the dynamics of a ﬂuid impacted by a high-speed
projectile can be found in Ref. [15]. Those events of atomization and airborne transport are rarely
observable in a crime scene, and distinguish spatters from other bloodstain patterns, such as transfers
where stains are produced by contact between the blood source and the target. Fig. 1 shows a typical
gunshot blood spatter, as provided in this work.
Fig. 2 describes the geometry and setup used to generate the spatters. Most spatters were pro-
duced on a vertical target, with the bullet hole indicating the bullet impact location. The travel
direction of the bullet was perpendicular to both the blood source and the target. For such a system,
the visible location of the bullet hole and the orientation of the image – the image width corre-
sponding to the horizontal direction of the experiment – deﬁnes the geometry. For the cases where
muzzle gases were allowed to interact with the spatter process, the barrel of the gun was perpen-
dicular to the cardstock target, and at the same distance from the blood source as the target, centered
into a cutout of about 1 in. in size. The cutout in the cardstock is also visible in the scans, and
determines the geometry of the spatter. Few spatters were produced on horizontal targets, where the
angle between the bullet trajectory and a horizontal line was varied between 0° and 60°.
The conditions of each experiment are documented in a text ﬁle located in the same directory as
the spatter image. For spatters on a vertical target, the conditions are summarized in Table 1, with the
range of each parameter, and the reason for documentation of each parameter. Fig. 3 provides a
synthetic view of the main variables investigated, the velocity of the impact that atomized the blood,
and the distance between blood source and spatter target. For spatters on a vertical target, each test
was denoted using the nomenclature described in Fig. 3. For spatters on a horizontal target, each test
was denoted using the nomenclature in Table 2. The investigated conditions are summarized in
Table 2. Some spatters names end with a number in parenthesis which our research team has used as
an alternate name. Note that some spatters have been described in a general manner and compared
to numerical models in Refs. [16,17].

high resolution of the stain edges is well visible, as well as the bullet hole in the middle picture, top left. Image segmentation
software such as the one used in Ref. [16] can count and measure more than 10,000 individual spots in the image, within a few
minutes of processing time.

The scanned images of the spatters are provided electronically in the appendix. Some of the
spatters contain well over 10,000 stains, each produced by the same single bullet. The high resolution
of the stain edges is well visible. Image segmentation software such as the one used in Ref. [16] can
count and measure more than 10,000 individual spots in the image, within a few minutes of
processing time.
2. Experimental design, materials and methods
Most backward spatters were generated at the Izaak Walton League Park indoor shooting range
(Ames, Iowa, USA) and a few spatters at an indoor range used by the Fort Dodge (Iowa, USA) Police
Depatment. The air was quiescent.
The riﬂe was held in position with an ad hoc metallic structure. The handgun was mounted in a
ﬁxed position with a Ransom rest (Master Combo Series, Ransom International Corp.). Ammunition
and gun description is in Table 3.
Most blood spatters were generated on ﬂat cardstock poster board sheets (UCreate, Walmart Inc.,
each 22 in.  28 in.). Targets of larger sizes were assembled by juxtaposing several poster board
sheets using masking tape at the back of the joints. The smooth side of the cardstock was used. An

Table 2
Description of the spatters on horizontal targets. The ﬁrst position denotes the gun (H standing for handgun, and R, for riﬂe);
the second position indicates the initial inclination angle δ between bullet trajectory and the horizontal (e.g., a0 denotes a zero
bullet inclination angle δ ¼ 0°), and the third position describes the horizontal distance D from the gun barrel exit to the blood
source in cm. The height H is measured from the center of the blood source to the ﬂoor. For example, H-a0-D300 stands for a
horizontal cardstock target (placed on the ﬂoor) with an initial bullet inclination angle δ ¼ 0° and a distance from the gun
barrel exit to the target of 300 cm. Trial numbers for each test case were appended at the end of the experimental nomen-
clature, e.g., as 1 and 2. Muzzle gases were either allowed to interact with the spatter or suppressed with a diffuser plate.
The asterisk denotes spatters analyzed in our earlier study on the ﬂuid dynamics of backspatters [17].

optical proﬁlometer (Zygo Newview 6300) measured the roughness of the target, with results
reported in Table 1. Spreading correlations, which link drop sizes, stain sizes and impact velocities
together, have been characterized on this substrate according to the methods in Ref. [19].
The blood source was either a foam or sponge soaked with blood, or a closed blood ﬁlled cavity
reservoir. The latter was prepared as follows. A section of paper was peeled back from one side of
foam board (Elmer's, USA). The foam board in a central cylindrical section (either one or two in. in
diameter) was then removed; the cavity was ﬁlled with blood. Clear packaging tape was utilized to
afﬁx the paper back over the blood-ﬁlled cavity. This latter setup became the source of choice because
of apparent improved reproducibility of the spatters, in comparison with the ones obtained with the
soaked foam or sponge. The type of blood sources are in Table 2 and Fig. 3, with details in the text ﬁles
describing the individual spatters provided as supplementary documentation.
Spatters on vertical targets were generated as follows: A cardstock target was used to collect the
backward spattered drops and was placed vertically between the muzzle of the gun and the target
(see Fig. 3a). The bullet trajectory was parallel to the ground at a height of typically 50–70 cm.
Spatters on horizontal targets were generated according to the geometry described in Fig. 3b and [17],
and summarized in Table 2.
To suppress or at least minimize the interaction of the muzzle gases with the back spatter process,
a high-density ﬁberboard diffuser plate pierced with a hole twice the diameter of the bullet was
placed between the gun and the target. For a few spatters, interaction with muzzle gases was allowed
by removing the diffuser plate; for vertical spatters, the gun barrel was placed at the same distance
from the blood source as the cardstock target, in a cutout made at the center of the cardstock target.

The experiments utilized ethically-sourced swine blood with an anticoagulant of either heparin or
ACD. The blood was drawn less than 72 h prior to any experiment. The blood was placed on a rocker
and was at room temperature. Hematocrit was measured with a dedicated centrifugation device (STI,
HemataStat-II). Room temperature and relative humidity were measured with a Mannix PTH8708
temperature-humidity pen.
The choice of swine blood can be explained as a compromise between safety and relevance to BPA
in a public university laboratory. Indeed, human blood is a biohazard, requiring extensive testing and
handling precautions to avoid risks such as HIV (human immunodeﬁciency virus) and hepatitis B and
C, which can be deadly if untreated. Artiﬁcial blood is still in a development phase, and it is not clear

whether it will ever be able to match all the complex – and still partly unknown [24] – characteristics
of actual blood [3]. Among available animal blood, swine blood is the closest to human blood in terms
of comparable physical properties [25], such as hematocrit range, shear viscosity of whole blood and
plasma, and erythrocyte aggregation behavior. Since swine blood has not been associated with risks
of HIV or hepatitis B, it is a safer substitute to human blood. Thus, swine blood was drawn from
healthy pigs screened for zoonotic diseases at the Ames USDA facilities. Blood was stored refrigerated
when not in use and allowed to reach room temperature before use. Personal protection equipment
for the biohazard while producing the spatters included coveralls, gloves, face shields, surgical masks,
and goggles, while gloves were used for manipulating dried spatters, e.g. during scanning.
After the spatter was produced, the target was removed from the holding ﬁxture and the bloodstains
were allowed to dry. Spatters were then digitized with a ﬂatbed scanner at 600 DPI. That resolution is
slightly better than what has been obtained with high-end photography [4], and allows a clear deﬁnition
of the edges of most stains. The use of a scanner also avoids issues of parallax, which are often present on
crime scene photographs. The spatters were scanned in a piecewise manner, by cutting the tape joining
the poster board sheets (tape was at their backside), because the maximum scanning area of the scanner
was European A3 format (297 mm  420 mm), signiﬁcantly smaller than the largest target posters. Poster
board sheets were never cut in that process. Scans were assembled using the image processing software
Adobe Photoshop, and saved as high-quality JPG's. A sticker was placed at the center of each sheet, to allow
precise assembly of the scans. Adobe Photoshop was used to remove most marks that were not stains,
such as the sticker, tape, or pencil marks. On vertical targets, the bullet hole or the cutout for the barrel is
visible. That hole and the fact that in the experiments with vertical targets, gravity goes vertically from top
to the bottom of the scanned image fully describes the geometry of the spatter generation, because bullets
travelled horizontally and normally through the vertical target and blood source. In experiments with
horizontal spatters, the top of the scanned image correspond to the location of the blood source.
