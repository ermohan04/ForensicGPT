Bloodstain evidence can be very powerful evidence in assault related crimes. Determination of the
distance that blood droplets may travel as a result of an impact into liquid blood may be of signiﬁcance to
corroborate or disprove a version of events, provide likely scenarios, or help determine the culpability of a
person in determining their proximity to the blood shedding event. It was the aim of this research to
determine the potential maximum distance blood droplets travel horizontally following a vertical impact
into liquid blood. A custom apparatus was designed and constructed to replicate a vertical impact of a
timber weapon, rotating on a ﬁxed axis at one end, striking a pool of liquid blood. The device was
positioned at three different levels of elevation to replicate an impact to the head of a person near ground
level, a seated or kneeling height and standing height. Overall, the results indicated that the application of
kinetic energy of between 1 and 5 J at a height of 1780 mm led to the blood droplets travelling a maximum
horizontal distance of 5361 mm (and average maximum distance of 4981 mm). The horizontal distance
blood droplets may travel upon impact does not appear to follow a linear trend with differing kinetic
energy, but is affected by the applied force and release height in a curvilinear relationship. The results
provide a valuable tool to bloodstain pattern analysts and investigators in determining search zones
within a scene, as well as providing information about the proximity of an individual to an impact event.

1. Introduction
Bloodstains can be one of the most common forms of biological
evidence located at assault related crime scenes. Bloodstains can
assist us in indicating who was involved in an assault via DNA
proﬁling, however bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) may assist in
determining where and how the blood shedding event occurred.
With a high proportion of physical assaults that result in death
coming from blunt force injuries [1], the physical characteristics of
bloodstains can be powerful evidence. Bevel and Gardner [2] state
that “bloodstain pattern analysis is based on a very simple theory:
blood as a ﬂuid will react to external forces in a predictable fashion”.
This theory sets the premise for BPA, in that the patterns are
reproducible under similar physical conditions [3] and as such the
physical characteristics of the bloodstain patterns can reﬂect the
nature of events that produced them.
The analysis of the size, shape, location, and distribution of
bloodstains can assist with information on how they were
deposited [4] and BPA often plays a role in supporting or refuting
statements of the victim, suspect or witness [3]. For example,
determining the volume and impact velocity of small bloodstains
may assist determining the position of where they originated [5],
potentially providing information about whether the blood
staining on a suspect’s clothing could have been deposited as a
result of rendering ﬁrst aid [6] or being a bystander. In recent times
the reliability of BPA methodology has been heavily scrutinised by
the courts and the scientiﬁc community. The National Research
Council report in 2009 [7] included the suggestion that an
understanding of the physics of ﬂuid transfer was required for
bloodstain pattern interpretation and reconstruction and that the
“uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are
enormous”. The fundamentals of ﬂuid dynamics relating to BPA
have been explored and certain aspects identiﬁed as requiring
further work to increase the understanding in this ﬁeld have been
identiﬁed [8,9]. Subsequently, there has been a signiﬁcant increase
in BPA research to explore the accuracy and reliability including a
comparative review of ﬂuid dynamics and BPA [8] that highlight
the links between them.
Historically much of the research in BPA has focused on
determining the area of origin, deﬁned as “the space in three
dimensions to which the trajectories of spatter can be utilized to

determine the location of the spatter producing event” [10]. A
numberof recent studies have focused on improving knowledge and
accuracy for areas including (but not limited to) position determi-
nation [5], the dynamics of blood release and formation of cast-off
patterns [11], numerical models for forward blood droplet trajectory
predictions [12] and back spatter from gunshots [13].
A common legal argument exists as to whether the blood-
staining located on a defendant [4] puts them in close proximity to
the victim at the time of the assault. Several crime scene cases
known to the authors of this study involved the defense that the
blood spatter stains located on the suspect’s clothing was the result
of being some distance from the assault, not through direct
involvement. This has led to the identiﬁcation of a gap in practical
empirical studies measuring the distance that blood droplets can
travel as a result of a blunt impact (excluding gunshots).
All recorded results from published peer reviewed studies
reporting the distances that impacted blood droplets have
travelled appear to have been incidental or secondary to the
aim of their research. MacDonnell and Bialousz [14] examined a
variety of aspects of bloodstain properties and dynamics, being the
ﬁrst to document the distance that blood travelled from origin
caused by medium to high velocity impact forces from a motor
driven device. The maximum distance travelled was stated to be
3380 mm, but unfortunately little further empirical data was
provided. Sweet [15] researched the velocity measurements of
blood droplets from a medium velocity impact source, using a steel
cylinder, in to a pool of liquid blood. Sweet noted bloodstains
located on paper 820 mm above and 430 mm away from the impact
site. Ristenbatt and Shaler [16] reported on the bloodstain pattern
analysis in a homicide case study where a victim was beaten about
the upper body. This article reported the maximum height the
blood recorded was 2700 mm and the maximum distance travelled
horizontally was 1900 mm, however as a case study the variables
surrounding the deposition of the blood were unknown and
inestimable. Slemko [17] in a project titled “The Effects of Droplet
Velocity and Fabric Composition” reported that the maximum
distance travelled by blood droplets propelled by a high speed fan
was recorded to be 3500 mm which was the limit of the test. More
recently Attinger et al. [18] show ﬁgures with several bloodstains
of between 1500 mm and 2000 mm from blood source to target,
Laan et al. [5] reported creating impact spatters at a distance of
1000 mm and Kabaliuk et al. [12] reported a ﬂight range of about
1530 mm.
The current practical study aims to investigate the mean and
maximum horizontal distances that blood droplets travel follow-
ing a vertical impact into liquid blood, under controlled conditions.
Utilising a custom designed impact device, the effect of kinetic
energy was explored at three different heights to replicate an
impact inﬂicted to a person positioned lying on the ground, sitting/
kneeling or when standing. The casework relevancy of these
results would assist in determining the maximum horizontal range
that a blood droplet could travel from an impact spatter event,
allowing an assessment of the likelihood of an individual’s
proximity to the event. The experimental design was intended
to replicate a range of situations and variables commonly
encountered in casework, based on practical constraints and the
need to control particular factors. This study was designed to
achieve experimental results useful to casework, rather than to test
or generate to theoretical or numerical models.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Device design
An apparatus was designed and built to create a range of
controlled strikes to impact liquid blood pools using a length
(1000  90  45 mm) of F17 hardwood timber (Fig. 1) rotating
about an axle at one end. A timber frame was built around the base
of a sheet of form ply board (1200  600  20 mm) using pine
timber (90  45 mm). A metal bracket and several metal corner
joiners supported a length of pine timber placed centrally and
vertically at the end of one of the form ply boards. A quarter circle
shaped piece of marine ply was placed on the opposite side of the
metal bracket with two pieces of pine secured on the upper sides of
the form ply to support the threaded metal rod which was inserted
through the hardwood timber “weapon”.
A length of F17 hardwood timber was used as the “weapon”
arm. This timber was speciﬁcally selected to have an even ﬂat edge,
high strength and high density value. A piece of hard, ﬂat marine
plywood, with a varnished upper surface, was placed on the base of
the form ply board where the distal end of the F17 timber striking
arm was to impact. A hole was drilled horizontally through the
proximal end of the F17 timber (Fig. 2) through which a threaded
metal rod was inserted (at the rotating point) providing a perfectly
level join when the F17 timber arm came together with the impact
striking surface. Bearing ﬂanges and bearing washers were utilised
to allow for a smoother movement of the arm with less friction.
A metal spring (Century brand
5
8 61
2 in. extension) was
connected to the F17 timber arm via a counter sunk metal eye hook
(Fig. 2), and attached to another threaded metal rod running
beneath the ply form board through a hole cut in the form ply
board (Fig. 3). The placement of the spring ensured that at rest, the
spring was in the neutral position (i.e. no tension applied).
The base and legs of the device were made from a second sheet
of framed form ply, with the same dimensions as the top. Three
lengths of pine timber (200 mm, 1000 mm and 1800 mm) were
used as supports to the impacting device (on the upper form ply
board) at three different impact surface heights (Fig. 4). Two 20 kg
bags of sand were placed in the base of the apparatus to maintain
stability and prevent movement of the device upon impact.
Incremental slots with shaft bearing ﬂanges were positioned on
the semi-circular bracket at various positions to control the
starting angle of the F17 timber arm. The F17 timber arm was held
in place by the stainless steel rod being inserted through the
bearing ﬂanges. The rod was removed by quickly pulling the
attached rope releasing the arm and allowing it to travel in a
downward arc to impact level with the plywood strike surface
(Fig. 5).
2.2. Trial pilot study
A pilot study was conducted to determine the approximate
distance the blood droplets could travel as well as their direction of
Fig. 1. Blood striking device.

spread, with a number of preliminary tests conducted using pig
blood. The dimensions of the trial room were 6400  6400  3000
mm. No blood was observed on the ceiling during or after the
testing. The spread of blood droplets from impact was determined
to be in the approximate range between 300 and 360 in front of
the device.
The placement of the incremental slots was based on the impact
velocity and spread of the blood during the pilot study. The initial
minimum position for the arm (C) was identiﬁed based on the
smaller spread and distance travelled and the maximum position (G)
by the smallest droplets. The remaining three increments (D, E and F)
were placed at equidistant positions on the marine ply bracket
between the minimum (C) and maximum (G) positions (Fig. 5).
During further testing, it was noted that the previously
identiﬁed minimum position (C) was generating a relatively high
velocity and kinetic force, which resulted in all ﬁve initially
selected increments producing similar bloodstain sizes and
distances. Therefore, two incremental slots (A and B) were added
during the course of testing.
2.3. Impact force
Prior to attaching the arm to the device, it was weighed using a
Mettler Toledo SB32001 DeltaRange electronic scale (including the
bearings and countersunk metal eye hook) to obtain the total mass
of 2.1925 kg (m).
As the F17 timber arm was rotating around a ﬁxed axis,
calculations were required to determine the angular momentum,
the ﬁnal velocity of the arm’s centre of mass and the kinetic energy
that would be transferred from the arm to the liquid blood. A
Mecmesin BFG 50 N basic force gauge was used to record the force
(F1) applied to the arm by the spring at each of the seven
increments (A–G). The displacement of the spring from the rest
position (x) to increment positions A–G were also recorded. The
height from the centre of mass (half way between the axis point
and the distal end of the arm) was marked and the vertical distance
between the start and the end position of the arm was recorded (h).
Knowing the distance from axis to the spring anchor point on the
arm (0.28 m) and the force applied to the arm by the spring at each
increment, the downward force (Fp) applied to the arm by the
spring at the centre of mass (0.49 m) could be calculated for each
increment (0.28F1 = 0.49Fp). Refer to Fig. 5 for visual identiﬁcation
of key locations.

The potential energy in the arm at the increment positions prior
to release consists of the potential energy of the arm in its centre of
mass and the energy in the spring, given by the force applied by the

After the velocity was calculated the kinetic energy applied to

Refer to Table 1 for the velocity and kinetic energy calculations.
2.4. Blood
Anticoagulants are necessary to prevent the onset of coagula-
tion that better represents the physical properties of blood at the
time of the assault [3] and as such have been used in many
bloodstain pattern research studies. There are a number of
different anticoagulants that have been used in BPA studies
including ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), which has
been reported as being suitable to prevent coagulation [19].
The physical properties of porcine blood, including hematocrit
range and shear viscosity of whole blood and plasma, closely
resemble that of human blood [18–20]. Its use up to two weeks old
has been shown to be similar to the behaviour of freshly spilt
human blood providing it had been collected directly into EDTA
anti-coagulant bottles and incubated at 4 C for that period [21]. It
is however recommended to use the porcine blood as soon as
possible after its collection to limit the possibility of change within
the blood properties [22].
Two litres of fresh pig blood was sourced directly into a 2 l
plastic container with 3.0 g of EDTA. The blood was transported
directly to the laboratory in a thermally insulated case and
placed into a water bath maintained at 37 C [20]. The water
bath was set to shake to keep the blood moving to prevent
separation and settling of erythrocytes [22]. Care was taken not
to deviate from ideal circumstances by controlling the temper-
ature of the blood, reducing the time the blood was exposed to
the air, indoor testing to reduce air currents and using a well-
deﬁned quantity of blood.
2.5. Experimental test area
A large enclosed storage shed with a level horizontal concrete
ﬂoor was used for the experimental testing. The dimensions of the
test room were 9845 mm wide, 9545 mm long with a minimum
ceiling height of 4666 mm (pitched roof maximum height of
5340 mm). All exposed surfaces (walls and ﬂoor) of the experi-
mental room were lined with plastic drop sheets for health and
safety reasons and ease of cleaning. The ﬂoor was further lined
with lengths of butcher paper from roles, which was replaced after
each test. The apparatus was placed at one end of the room to allow

for 7000 mm space in front of the device (in the approximate range
of a 300–360 arc).
2.6. Experimental protocol
For each trial, 1 ml of blood was taken from the pig blood
container in the water bath container using a 10 ml syringe and
deposited on the ﬂat plywood impact surface within the strike
zone (i.e. the area directly impacted by the F17 timber arm outlined
by marker in Fig. 6). Within seconds of placement, to minimize
heat loss from the blood, a controlled impact was applied to the
blood pool by releasing the F17 timber from its starting position at
each increment. Each impact on the device was video recorded by
using a GoPro camera on a tripod with a timer on an Apple iPad Air
displayed.
After each impact the furthest lying visible single bloodstain
was located and measured horizontally to the point of origin (distal
end of the F17 timber) using a Hilti PD42 laser measurer. To ensure
accurate measurement, a vertical pole from the bloodstain was
used to guide the position of the laser measurer. A high resolution
image using a Nikon D300 dSLR camera was also taken from
directly above the blood stains (Fig. 7). The F17 timber arm and
strike plate were cleaned of blood residue after each test.
Five replicates were performed at increments A and B at Height
1 (250 mm from ﬂoor), and ten replicates for increments C–G. Due
to results obtained at this initial height, increments F and G were
not tested at greater heights. Therefore, ﬁve replicates were
performed for A and B and ten replicates for increments C–E for
both Heights 2 (1160 mm from the ﬂoor) and 3 (1780 mm from the
ﬂoor), resulting in a total of 140 impacts across the three heights.
Visual analysis of the ceiling of the room was also conducted to
determine if any stains had reached that height. The distance data
obtained was analysed in real-time during the experiment for
consistency and variation, with one sample t-tests being used to
test datasets within each increment to determine if additional
replicates were required to generate reliable results. Each group of
replicates was also checked during experimentation for normality,
skewness and kurtosis, with z-tests being used to determine the
equality of variances between adjacent groups (increments and
heights) during testing.
Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS v21.0 (IBM Corpora-
tion, Chicago). The consistency of impact time and therefore
kinetic energy across the repeated experiments was investigated
using a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparing
before and after time measurements. A two-way ANOVA was
conducted to compare the main effects and interaction of the
ordinal variables height and increment on the furthest distance
blood travelled.
3. Results
3.1. Kinetic energy released during impact
Thecharacteristicsof thetimberarm, spring and increments were
measured to calculate the ﬁnal velocity of the arm and the kinetic
energy imparted to the blood stain upon impact (Table 1). The
consistency of impact kinetic energy was investigated by measuring
the time taken for the F17 timber arm to travel from release to impact
prior to the experiments across 5–10 replicates per increment, and
the corresponding time post-experiment with 10 replicates per
increment (Table 2). A repeated measures ANOVA indicated that no
signiﬁcant differences existed between the pre- and post-experi-
ment times overall (F2,53 = 0.066, p = 0.798), and that there was no
differential changes in travel times between increments (F6,53 = 1.35,
p = 0.252). It can therefore be inferred that the time taken for the F17
timber arm to travel, and therefore the kinetic energy imparted, was
consistent throughout the experiment.
3.2. Experimental test results
The impact height and kinetic energy imparted both inﬂuenced
the distance the blood travelled after impact. Impact heights of
250 mm resulted in distances ranging from 2109 mm to 3404 mm
(Table 3), with an overall average of 2835 mm across all seven
increments and 2109 mm from the lower ﬁve. Impact heights of
1160 mm resulted in distances travelled of 2895 mm–4850 mm,
with an average of 3732 mm from the lower ﬁve increments.
Impact heights of 1780 mm resulted in blood droplets travelling
between 3256 mm and 5361 mm, with an average of 3901 mm.
Both the height and increment had signiﬁcant effects on the
distance that the blood travelled (height F2
123 = 281.92, p < 0.01;
increment F6
123 = 58.17, p < 0.01), with height showing a greater
effect (h2 = 0.43) than the increment (h2 = 0.27). There was also a
small but signiﬁcant interaction between the height and increment
(F8
123 = 6.24, p < 0.01), although this interaction had a minimal
effect size (h2 = 0.04).

Fig. 8 is a boxplot of the furthest distance travelled by
increment. The boxes represent the 25th–75th percentiles (the
interquartile range – IQR) and thick black line the median of each
group. Whiskers indicate 1.5 the IQR, while dots represent
outliers greater than 1.5 the IQR. There is clear separation
between the three heights at the lowest increment, separation
between Height 1 and Heights 2 and 3 at the second and third
increments, overlapping between the distributions of distances at
the higher increments, demonstrating the interaction between
height and kinetic energy on the distances blood droplets may
travel upon impact.
Post-hoc testing with Bonferroni correction indicated that the
distance travelled by blood impacted at greater height differed
signiﬁcantly compared to lower heights, with mean distances
increasing from 2837 mm at Height 1, to 3778 mm at Height 2, to
4117 mm at Height 3 (all pairwise p-values <0.05). In contrast,
increasing increments, and therefore the kinetic energy imparted,
did not show a consistent linear relationship. Post-hoc testing
demonstrated that Increments B and C had greater distances
(p < 0.05) than Increments A, D, E, F and G, with the latter
increments forming a homogenous group with regards to distance
(all p > 0.05). Spline interpolation (Fig. 9) and regression modelling
(data not shown) indicated that the distance travelled by blood
droplets under different kinetic energies follows a cubic trend,
with low distances at low energies, increasing rapidly when the
kinetic energy is 1–5 J, and decreasing to previous levels above
this energy level. Further research, particularly at lower energies,
may clarify the nature of this curvilinear relationship.
4. Discussion
This research was designed to determine the maximum
horizontal distance blood droplets will travel through the air
from a vertical impact into liquid blood. Whilst not possible to
replicate and control many of the variables associated with an
impact, it is important in any research of this nature to know that
the blood being used approximates human blood leaving the body.
To assist in achieving this, fresh pig blood was used with EDTA
anticoagulant, the blood was kept at a temperature of 37 C prior
to placement on the impact device. Testing commenced within
24 h of the collection of the blood and was completed within 72 h.

The hematocrit and viscosity of the blood would have provided
greater information regarding the rheology of the blood [18,24],
although was unfortunately not available at the time.
A custom built mechanical apparatus was used where liquid
blood was placed on a hard, ﬂat timber surface and second hard,
ﬂat F17 timber arm impacted the entire volume of the blood pool.
The two hard ﬂat surfaces delivered a signiﬁcant proportion of the
total kinetic energy to the blood to achieve the best case scenario.
The downward motion of the apparatus was controlled by a spring
and was locked in place at several different increments to control
the velocity of the impact and ultimately the kinetic energy. The
device was set at three different heights — near ground level to

replicate an assault of a person low to the ground (Height 1),
approximate sitting, crouching or kneeling height (Height 2) and
standing height (Height 3), as the height can be important
indicator to a forensic investigator as it may indicate an offensive or
defensive position [23,25].
The two hard ﬂat surfaces coming together provided a very
narrow space for the blood to escape (see Fig. 10) and it appeared
that the majority of the blood travelled forward or to the side of the
F17 timber arm in almost a 300–360 arc. Little blood appeared to
travel back towards the rear of the apparatus, potentially being
blocked by the arm only leaving the front and sides to escape.
Within this research, the angular distribution of stains was not
recorded, as the focus was on distance rather than direction.
However, it was noted that the majority of most distant stains were
estimated to be between 300-360 in front of the impact plate.
Several instances were however noted at more extreme angles,
indicating that further research regarding the distribution of blood
droplets may be instructive.
Prior to this research project being undertaken, the furthest
recorded distance, identiﬁed by the authors, in a published journal
was 3380 mm by MacDonnell and Bialousz [14]. It can be
established from the results of this research project that these
distances can be expanded to 5360 mm and is more consistent
with the prediction of James [26] that blood may potentially travel
up to approximately 6000 mm, although it is unknown how this
ﬁgure was determined.
4.1. Kinetic energy
This research discovered that the change in kinetic energy
followed a cubic trend with low distances travelled at low energies,
increasing rapidly when the kinetic energy was increased to
between 1 and 5 J and decreasing again when above this energy
level (i.e. above 5 J). When a disruptive external force is applied to
liquid blood, liquid sheets and ligaments are forced out [5] and
when the cohesive surface tension forces of the liquid blood/air
interface are exceeded droplets will separate [11]. Dependent on
the level of force applied to the liquid blood, the droplets may
further deform in ﬂight into a “bag- or dumbbell-like shape” before
breaking up into smaller droplets which may have signiﬁcant
effects on the overall drag force [12]. Once separated the blood
droplets follow a trajectory dictated by the velocity and by the
combined forces of gravity and drag [11,12]. Due to drag, the
velocity of the blood droplet decreases as it ﬂies through the air [5]
as the forces of gravity act upon it. A paper by Kabaliuk et al. [12]
comprehensively details the ﬂuid dynamics of blood droplets
following an impact.
The low kinetic energy impacts in this experiment (<1 J) may
have created less disruption of the liquid blood and therefore
produced a larger blood droplet sphere with lower initial velocity
and therefore more inﬂuenced by gravity, and to a lesser extent
air resistance. The higher kinetic energy impacts applied to the
blood in this experiment (>5 J) may have led to a larger initial
velocity of blood droplets reducing the initial inﬂuence of gravity
[25] but potentially slowing due to deformation into secondary
droplets and subsequent effects from drag leading to a smaller
ﬂight range [12]. The medium kinetic energy (between 1 and 5 J)
appeared to have created a higher velocity than the low kinetic
energy impact but potentially resulted in less deformation
allowing the droplets to travel further whilst subjected to the
forces of gravity and drag.
4.2. Height
The height of the impacts appeared to have a more signiﬁcant
effect on the distance blood droplets travelled than kinetic energy
alone. The blood from Height 3 travelled further than Height 2,
which in turn was further than Height 1. Whilst Height 3 obtained
the greatest distance, the signiﬁcance of height cannot be
underestimated in the context of an assault:
 At Height 1, replicating an assault on a person lying at
approximately ground level, the maximum distance that the
blood droplets travelled was at Increment B measuring 3404 mm
from the point of impact (bloodstain dimensions 7.2 mm  2.1
mm) with an average of 3310 mm.
 At Height 2, replicating a seated, crouching or kneeling person,
the maximum distance achieved was 4850 mm (bloodstain
dimensions 8.2 mm  5.2 mm) with an average of 4582 mm
achieved at Increment B.
 At Height 3, replicating a person of average height standing, the
maximum distance being 5361 mm (bloodstain dimensions
5.8 mm  4.9 mm) and an average of 4980 mm, again achieved
at Increment B, these results were as previously identiﬁed the
furthest of the three heights.
Based on the ﬁndings and observations of the experimental trials,
it can be assumed that blood spatter droplets caused through an
impact having lower trajectories (250 mm heights) will travel
shorter distances before impacting with the ground. The impacts at
Height 2, replicating a kneeling or crouching height of a person, and
Height 3, replicating a standing person, can be expected to create
moredistant bloodstains duetothe droplets being in ﬂight forlonger
periods of time before making contact with the ground. These results
supporttheﬁndings ofdeBruinetal.[25] withthehigherelevationof
the blood source, the blood droplets would have an increased ﬂight
time before they make contact with the ground.
4.3. Practical implications
When examining a scene of an assault the crime scene
examiner and/or the bloodstain pattern analyst must determine
the size of the scene. The general method is to start with the
outermost stains and work inward, however this relies upon
Fig. 10. View of the liquid blood on the strike plate during impact from the F17 timber arm (left), and post-impact stain (right). Arrows indicated the approximate 300–360
arc of the bloodstain travel.

knowledge of the potential greatest distance that blood droplets
may travel in a variety of impact scenarios. Thus, with the
knowledge that blood droplets can travel up to 5361 mm in an
indoor environment, this range could assist scene examiners
with the size of a search zone. It is acknowledged that further
studies relating to the distribution of the bloodstains resultant
from an impact into liquid blood at the various heights and
applications of kinetic energy would add further value to the
blood stain analyst.
Other forensic contexts of the results obtained may also include
(i) establishment of a range that allows an assessment of the level
of support that the blood stain evidence provides to different
versions of events, for example if a witness states that the assault
took place in a certain location but the bloodstain evidence was
found outside the possible maximum deposition zone, or (ii) using
the information may help determine proximity to the assault, and
therefore potential involvement, of a suspect who states that they
were some distance away, for example 15 m, yet spatter blood-
stains were located on their clothing.
4.4. Research limitations
This research was designed to replicate blood distribution
caused by impact, such as that occurring during an assault upon a
person. Such events are highly dynamic, and it is not possible to
fully replicate all variables that may occur in all possible situations.
Experimental trials were conducted in controlled conditions to
ensure consistency and allow comparison between the key
variables of interest, namely impact height and kinetic energy.
As such, the inﬂuence of variables such as differing amounts of
blood, direction of force, the nature of the impact surface (curved/
pliable), the impact of air currents or temperature, and the
movement of impacted surface are unknown. As detailed earlier
the hematocrit and viscosity of the blood were not recorded in this
experiment and therefore potentially limited the experimental
results. The tools used to record the research project results were
also limited due to cost and availability. Such limitations included
the use of an iPhone 6s the Slo-Mo (slow motion) function on its
Camera application. Whilst it recorded at 240 frames per second a
camera with much higher frame rates would have provided more
accurate information.
5. Conclusion
The aim of this study was to identify the maximum horizontal
distance a blood droplet would travel as a result of a vertical impact
into liquid blood. Whilst there were several assumptions and
limitations 
identiﬁed, 
the 
maximum 
average 
distance 
was
recorded as 4981 mm with the maximum individual recording
being 5361 mm. These distances provide a range to which blood
droplets could be expected to travel horizontally as a result of an
impact into liquid blood with a blunt weapon.
This research demonstrated that the application of kinetic
energy between 1 and 5 J resulted in the formation of blood spatter
stains at the furthermost distances from an impact into liquid
blood. Kinetic energy levels either side of this range reduced the
distance the blood travelled. An increase in height of the impact
point had a signiﬁcant effect on the distance the blood travelled
with the height corresponding to a standing person recording the
furthest distance. Combining kinetic energy of between 1 and 5 J
with Height 3 resulted in the furthest deposit of blood.
The 
methodology 
presented 
in 
this 
study 
offers 
useful
information to bloodstain pattern analysts, crime scene examiners
and investigators when considering the bloodstain evidence in
context of the scene and may help establish determining the
circumstances of the assault event. These results may provide
assistance with establishing a nexus between the crime scene and
any offenders involved in the perpetration of the offence, the level
of involvement of individuals, likely scenarios as to events, or
evaluating the support the evidence provides to accounts given by
witnesses and/or suspects.
