Abstract 
A total of 103 suicidal and 29 homicidal 
gunshot fatalities were evaluated. In 42% of the 
suicides, characteristic 
findings like blood spatters and/or powder soilings, could be found on 
the shooting 
hand by naked-eye 
inspection 
indicating 
the importance 
of an accurate 
examination 
of the deceased’s hands at autopsy 
for a preliminary 
diagnosis. 
Petechial 
hemorrhages of the conjunctivae 
due to the gas pressure after discharge of the weapon were 
observed in 22% of those cases with contact shot wounds to the head/neck, but not in cases 
of distant 
shot injuries 
following 
the use of non-high 
velocity 
ammunition. 
Therefore, 
conjunctival 
petechiae can be regarded as an additional 
but optional 
sign of contact head 
shots in cases without 
alterations 
possibly 
influencing 
the development 
of conjunctival 
pin-point 
bleedings. The evidence of such findings can be of practical 
importance 
if the 
entrance shot wound cannot be examined for whatever reason.

1. Introduction 
The differentiation 
between suicidal and homicidal 
gunshots is mainly based on 
the entrance wound 
morphology 
and the detection of gunshot residues on the 
shooting hand [4,6,10,13]. In addition to the chemical analysis of gunshot residues, 
the appearance of tissue particles or blood spatters on or in the barrel of the 
weapon as well as on the hands of the deceased can contribute 
substantially 
to the 
reconstruction 
of the case [1,3,1 I, 121. In particular 
at autopsy, 
the naked-eye 
detection of biological 
traces or powder soilings on the shooting hand is of great 
importance 
for a preliminary 
diagnosis. In order to elucidate the percentage of 
cases in which these ‘suicidal markers’ can be observed without 
extensive analysis, 
the present study was performed. 
Another 
aspect of the study was to provide 
information 
on the frequency of conjunctival 
petechiae in head shot fatalities and 
to investigate whether such findings can support the assumption of contact gunshot 
wounds to the head in cases in which an examination 
of the entrance injury cannot 
be performed. 
2. Material 
and methods 
In the period January 
1991 -November 
1993, a total of 103 suicidal and 29 
homicidal gunshot fatalities without signs of relevant putrefaction 
were autopsied at 
the Department 
of Legal Medicine, 
Munich, 
Germany. The individual 
age ranged 
between 1 and 85 years; 6% of the suicides (6 out of 103 cases) were committed by 
females, but 48% (14 out of 29) of the homicide victims were female. The presence 
of visible gunshot residues on the hands like powder soilings or blood spatters and 
of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae 
was recorded in contact or distant 
shot wounds. 
Differentiation 
was made between the localization 
of the injuries 
(head/neck or trunk) and, if possible, between the firearms used (revolver, pistol 
rifle/shotgun). 
3. Results 
In 97 out of the 103 cases (94%) contact injuries could be found localized on the 
head (right 
or left temple, frontal, 
nose, cheek-bone, mouth, 
chin, submental, 
occipital) 
or the neck. Only six suicides showed shot injuries to the chest and in 
none of them (weapon used: rifle/shotgun) 
were blood spatters found on the hands. 
In 18 suicides, a revolver was used, 52 suicides were performed with a pistol, in 22 
cases the weapon was a rifle or shotgun and in the remaining 
11 fatalities the type 
of the gun was not recorded in the investigation 
files. In 33 out of the 103 gunshot 
suicides (32%): blood spatters were detectable on the hands by naked-eye inspection 
(revolvers 
33%, pistols 35% rifles/shotguns 
27% and 27% of the fatalities 
with 
unknown 
weapons). Visible 
powder 
soilings were additionally 
detected in two 
further suicides (2%) and eight cases (8%) showed exclusively powder soilings, but 
no blood spatters, leading to a total of 43 out of 103 cases (42%) with characteristic 
signs on the shooting 
hand. In analyzing 
the frequency 
of such visible traces

76 (199.5) 47-53 
49 
dependent on the calibre of the guns, a positive correlation 
was found in the group 
‘pistols’, but no clear results were obtained in the cases in which revolvers or long 
guns were used (Table 1). 
In none of the investigated 29 gunshot homicides were visible blood spatters or 
powder soilings found on the victims’ hands. 
The frequency 
of petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctivae 
in suicides with 
contact 
gunshot 
injuries 
to the head/neck 
was about 22%. In evaluating 
the 
percentage of positive results dependent on type and calibre of the weapons used, 
the group ‘rifle/shotgun’ 
revealed a higher percentage of positive findings (32%) 
than that of pistols (20%) or revolvers (17%) but no clear relationship 
between the 
appearance of conjunctival 
petechiae and different calibres of the guns was found 
(Table 2). 
In six out of the 29 homicides, contact injuries to the head were found and in 
three of these six cases petechial hemorrhages 
had developed. In none of the 
remaining 23 homicides with distant shot injuries did conjunctival 
pin-point 
bleed- 
ings occur.

4. Discussion 
The differentiation 
between suicidal 
and homicidal 
gunshot 
fatalities 
is - 
besides the reconstruction 
of the death scene and the investigation 
of the entrance 
wound - 
mainly based on the evidence of gunshot residues or blood spatters on 
the shooting 
hand. In particular, 
gunshot residues like powder soilings can be 
present even though they are not detectable by naked-eye examination 
indicating 
the importance 
of a further chemical analysis. By these techniques positive results 
can be obtained in approximately 
40-90% of the cases with variations 
dependent 
on the weapon used [5,6,10,13]. At autopsy, however, the naked-eye detection of 
characteristic 
signs on the shooting hand can contribute 
to the preliminary 
recon- 
struction 
of the case and seems, therefore, to be of considerable practical impor- 
tance. In previous 
studies different 
results concerning 
visible 
shot residues, in 
particular 
on the weapon, were reported, while studies dealing with the frequency 
of characteristic 
signs on the shooting 
hand are very rare. In the old German 
forensic literature, 
Briining 
and Wiethold 
[l] detected blood spatters on the hand 
only ‘in a few’ of hundreds of investigated suicides, but described in 24 out of 42 
(57%) selected cases biological 
traces on or in the barrel of the weapon used. A 
considerably 
higher percentage of such findings 
was reported by Fraenckel and

51 
Strassmann in 1925 [3] who found these characteristic 
signs in or on the weapon in 
‘nearly all cases’ with contact gunshot wounds. Recently, Stone supported this view 
and described positive results of 53% in the barrel or 74”/0 on the barrel of revolvers 
and 57% and 76% in or on pistols, respectively [l 11. The frequency of characteristic 
signs on the shooting hand was investigated by Zwingli 
[13] in 144 suicidal gunshot 
fatalities of the years 1929-1938. This author found blood spatters in 14% of the 
cases (5% of the revolvers and 20% of the pistols) and powder soilings were noticed 
in 29 of these 144 cases (20%) with higher percentages in suicides performed by 
revolvers (46%) when compared to pistols (12%). Furthermore, 
Reed [6] observed 
blood on the hands in 44% of the investigated suicides but it is not clear whether 
blood spatters or larger sized areas of blood, which cannot be interpreted 
as a 
characteristic 
sign of the shooting hand, were detected. 
In our series, relevant differences between the groups ‘revolvers’ and ‘pistols’, as 
described by Zwingli 
[13], could not be obtained. 
Visible powder soilings were 
found on the shooting hand only in a rather low percentage of the cases ( - 10%) 
but blood spatters occurred in 32%, giving a total of 43% of our cases in which 
characteristic 
signs were detectable on the shooting hand by naked-eye inspection. 
A further 
differentiation 
of the frequency 
of positive 
results dependent on the 
calibres of the weapons resulted in a clear tendency to higher percentages of blood 
spatters in cases of increased calibres in particular 
of pistols. Since the gas pressure 
following 
the discharge of the gun is assumed to be responsible for the development 
of back spatters on the weapon and on the shooting hand [9], this observation can 
easily be explained by the usually greater gas pressures of cartridges with larger 
calibres. In evaluating the suicides performed with revolvers however, this tendency 
could not be confirmed probably due to the comparatively 
small number of cases. 
The (surprising) 
observation that blood spatters were more frequent after discharge 
of 0.38 special revolvers when compared to the 0.357 calibre Magnum 
could be 
explained by the fact that, in two out of our three cases, with the use of a 0.357 
Magnum 
revolver 0.38 special cartridges were fired. 
The rather low frequency of visible powder soilings (6- 10% of our cases) as 
another characteristic 
sign of the shooting hand and the absence, at least partially, 
of relevant differences between the groups, ‘revolvers - 
pistols - 
rifles/shotguns’, 
can probably be explained by a difficult naked-eye detection of slight powder traces, 
whereas faint blood spatters can also be detected by accurate investigation. 
There- 
fore, in practice, the detection of visible powder soilings seems to be inferior to that 
of blood spatters at autopsy, but positive results can be expected more frequently 
following 
chemical analysis [5,6,10,13] indicating 
their importance for a conclusive 
diagnosis. With regard to these results, it can be emphasized that the evidence of 
visible ‘markers’ of the shooting hand, i.e. powder soilings and especially blood 
spatters, already contribute 
to the diagnosis of a suicide at autopsy in a consider- 
able number of the cases ( - 43%) whereas negative results provide no reliable 
information. 
Furthermore, 
the detection of these characteristic 
signs supports the 
conclusions 
drawn from the investigation 
of the entrance wounds showing typical 
features of contact shots, like soiling patterns on the skin surrounding 
the charac- 
teristic entrance injury, perhaps in combination 
with a muzzle impression. Since the 


--- PAGE 6 ---

52

hernational 
76 (1995) 
47-53 
head is the most favoured 
site ( - 80-90%) 
of suicidal 
gunshots 
[2,8,11], the 
combination 
of a typical 
injury 
pattern on this topographical 
location 
and the 
evidence of biological 
traces or powder soilings on the hands can be regarded as a 
strong (but not unambiguous!) 
sign for suicide. 
On the other hand, when an investigation 
of the entrance wound cannot be 
performed during autopsy for whatever reason then it would be very important 
to 
discover other morphological 
features which occur typically 
after contact shots to 
the head supporting 
- 
but not proving 
- 
the diagnosis of a suicide. Such a 
parameter could be the detection of petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctivae 
which were found in our series in 21 out of 97 cases (22%) with suicidal and in three 
out of six cases with homicidal 
contact gunshot wounds to the head or the neck. 
The reason for the development of these conjunctival 
pin-point 
bleedings seems to 
be ruptures of small vessels localized in the loose connective tissue of the eyelid or 
conjunctiva 
due to the rapid expansion of the gas following 
the discharge of the 
weapon tightly 
pressed to the skull or introduced 
into the mouth. 
The lower 
percentage of positive 
results in suicides performed 
with revolvers (17%) when 
compared, in particular, 
to rifles or shotguns (32%) can easily be explained by the 
reduced gas pressure in the barrel due to the construction 
of this type of weapon. 
In addition, 
the gas pressure produced by the discharge of cartridges of long guns 
can be assumed to be greater, as a rule, than that of handguns. Even though one 
can expect that the use of larger calibres results in a higher frequency of positive 
results in comparison to smaller ones, this assumption could not be confirmed in 
our series probably due to comparatively 
small numbers of some calibres. Further- 
more, the localization 
of the entrance wound 
and the track of bullet 
are of 
substantial 
importance for the development of conjunctival 
petechiae. Our results 
verify that conjunctival 
petechiae can occur in cases with entrance wounds or tracks 
of the bullet in close topographical 
correlation 
to the orbital region following 
the 
discharge of cartridges of larger as well as of smaller calibres. Since in our series 
only one out of eight contact shots to the neck resulted in petechial haemorrhages 
and the weapon used was a shotgun, it would seem that considerable gas pressures 
only are sufficient for the development of such findings in cases with a more distant 
entrance injury, 
for example localized on the neck. On the other hand, it seems 
possible that (even distant head shot) injuries induced by high-velocity 
cartridges 
can result in the development 
of pin-point 
bleedings of the conjunctivae 
due to 
special biological effects, but in our series the use of such ammunition 
could not be 
observed. In distant shots to the head or in contact shots to the chest following 
the 
use of ‘usual’ cartridges, however, no petechial bleedings were found regardless of 
the weapon used since apparently 
insufficient 
gas pressures near the orbital region 
appear. Therefore, the presence of conjunctival 
pin-point 
bleedings, besides other 
changes like haemorrhages in the fissure of the shoulder joint of the shooting hand 
[7], can support the diagnosis of suicidal head gunshots in cases without 
other 
alterations like aspiration, 
which could influence the development of such findings, 
and can possibly provide additional 
useful information 
in differentiation 
suicide/ 
homicide.
