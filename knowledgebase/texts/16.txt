This paper discusses the effects of thickness, mass per unit area, sett, yarn linear density and twist of
calico fabrics (100% cotton, plain woven) on the morphology of passive bloodstains. Horse blood was
dropped vertically onto three calico fabrics with different mass per unit areas (85.1 g/m2, 163.5 g/m2 and
224.6 g/m2). Six different impact velocities were used (1.7 ms1, 2.9 ms1, 4.1 ms1, 4.9 ms1, 5.1 ms1 and
5.4 ms1). The dry bloodstains were largest on the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. The low
yarn linear density and large inter-yarn spaces meant that the blood could wick into the yarns from all
directions and along the intra-yarn spaces. The calico with the middle mass per unit area had the smallest
mean dry bloodstain area for four out of the six velocities. The twist level for this calico was greater than
for the calicos with a heavier or lighter mass per unit area. This reduced the amount of wicking which
occurred along the yarns due to the tighter yarn structure. The calico with the heaviest mass per unit area
had the highest yarn linear density resulting in a thicker fabric, so the blood could not as easily penetrate
into the fabric. This resulted in a thicker wet blood layer remaining on the fabric surface, where it
gradually wicked vertically into the yarns under gravity. Less wicking along the yarns occurred, resulting
in a smaller bloodstain than on the fabric with the lightest mass per unit area. The correlation between
impact velocity and mean dry bloodstain area was greater for the calicos with the medium and heaviest
mass per unit area than for the calico with the lightest mass per unit area. For the calicos with the
medium and heaviest mass per unit area, the distance the blood spread laterally at impact, which
increased with the increase in impact velocity, had a greater inﬂuence on the dry bloodstain area than the
amount of wicking.

1. Introduction
Although bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) has been used by
crime scene investigators for over a century [1], questions have
been raised on the scientiﬁc validity of the work [2]. The premise
of BPA is that the pattern that blood creates when impacting a
surface will enable the observer to gain an idea of the events
which occurred to cause the bloodshed. However, the wide
variety of creation mechanisms, drop sizes, impact velocities and
target surfaces indicate the complexity of BPA [3]. The reliability
of pattern classiﬁcation of ﬁve bloodstain patterns on non-
absorbent rigid surfaces [4] and fabric surfaces [5] by expert BPA
analysts 
has 
been 
considered. 
On 
non-absorbent 
surfaces
incorrect classiﬁcations were made 13.1% of the time [4] and
on fabric surfaces incorrect classiﬁcations were made 23.4% of the
time [5].
As such, more research is being undertaken on the understand-
ing of the interaction of blood with a variety of surfaces. Work has
been carried out on non-absorbent surfaces (e.g. steel and plastic
[6]) and partially absorbent surfaces (e.g. paper and wood [7–9]).
Equations have resulted that use the bloodstain size and number of
spines 
to back-calculate the impact velocity and 
assist 
in
determination of the origin of the bloodstain [7–9].
Bloodstains on household and clothing fabrics often found at
crime scenes are also being researched. To understand bloodstains
on fabrics, it is important to consider wetting and wicking. Wetting
and wicking are the mechanisms by which liquids move into and
through a fabric [10]. Wetting occurs when the surface energy of a
solid overcomes the surface tension of a liquid, allowing the liquid
to spread on the surface [10]. Once a fabric has been wetted,
wicking can occur. Wicking is the spontaneous transport of a liquid
into a porous system by capillary forces. The rate at which the

wicking occurs is dependent on the dimensions of the capillaries
within the substrate, and the viscosity of the liquid [11].
Fibre content and fabric structure affect the wetting and
wicking properties of a fabric [12,13]. A 65% polyester/35% cotton
plain woven fabric produced larger bloodstains than either 100%
cotton or 100% polyester plain woven fabrics. De Castro et al.
[12,13] hypothesised that this may be in part due to the random
mixture of cotton staple and cut polyester ﬁbres which are spun
together in a blend. This may have created larger interstitial spaces
which resulted in more capillary action. Differences in capillary
forces within 100% cotton plain woven and single jersey knitted
fabrics may have resulted in the larger parent bloodstain area for
the former [12].
When otherwise identical 100% cotton plain weave fabrics were
manufactured from yarns which were either ring, rotor open end or
Murata vortex air jet spun, porcine blood wicked only into the
fabric woven from ring spun yarn [14]. When porcine blood was
dropped vertically on to a commercially woven bed sheet, the
elliptical bloodstains created were attributed to the warp yarns
being ring spun, which wicked blood, and the weft yarns being
Murata vortex spun, which did not. Therefore, even fabrics which
appear identical may not result in similar bloodstains if the yarn
manufacturing technique is different.
Scanning bloodstains with the use of a micro computed
tomography (mCT) scanner provided a greater insight into the
internal structure of bloodstains on fabric [15]. For 100% cotton rib
knit fabric sideways wicking (i.e. wicking along the yarns in the
length and width of the fabric) dominated at the fastest impact
velocity (5.3 ms1), resulting in larger, shallower bloodstains [15].
However, for 100% cotton drill fabric, little variation was seen as
the velocity increased from 2.9 ms1 to 5.3 ms1. A suggested
explanation was that the small capillary spaces for the drill fabric
resulted in the blood not spreading regardless of velocity.
Previous work has had inconsistent methodology which
precludes the ability to compare and conglomerate the research.
There is often inconsistency in the treatment of the fabric prior to
experimentation, for example not stated [16,17], from a second-
hand store so unknown [18] and sometimes laundered, although
not always for the same number of cycles [19,20]. In a number of
articles, the fabric properties (e.g. mass per unit area, thickness,
sett, yarn linear density and twist) are not provided [16,17,19,21].
Whilst work has been published on the effects of fabric and
ﬁbre content on bloodstain morphology, the effect of mass per unit
area has not been extensively studied. The aim of the current work
was to understand the effects of fabric mass per unit area and blood
impact velocity on the resultant parent bloodstain formed on three
100% cotton plain woven fabrics.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
To ensure the research was relevant to BPA, the fabrics used
were ‘household textiles’. Three rolls of calico fabric (100% cotton,
plain woven), each with a different mass per unit area (85.1 g/m2
(light), 163.5 g/m2 (medium) and 224 g/m2 (heavy)) were obtained
from a fabric supplier2 in order to study the effect of the different
mass per unit areas on passive bloodstains (Table 1).
Dimensionally stable fabrics were created by washing the
fabrics for six cycles in a domestic washing machine3 before line
drying [22]. The fabrics were ironed under the same conditions
using a PSP-202E digital steam press on the cotton setting to
remove creases. 100 mm  100 mm specimens (n = 90) were cut
from the fabrics, minimising repetition of warp and weft yarns, and
were conditioned to 20  2 C and 65  4% R.H. for 24 h [23].
Fabric thickness (mm) [24], mass per unit area (g/m2) [25] and
sett [26] were measured. Yarn linear density was estimated by the
removal of ten 1 m long yarns from the fabric and weighing them
using an Oxford A2204 balance accurate to four decimal places. The
twist level and yarn type were provided by the fabric supplier4
(Table 1). SEM images of the fabrics at 50 magniﬁcation and the
warp and weft yarns at 75 magniﬁcation are available in the
electronic Supplementary material.
Deﬁbrinated 
horse 
blood 
sourced 
from 
Southern 
Group
Laboratory5 was used to create the bloodstains. The blood was
stored below 4 C, and used within one week of delivery.
2.2. Method
The horse blood was heated to 37 C in a water bath to simulate
a blood-letting event at body temperature. Blood drops were
formed in a Pasteur pipette and dropped from six different heights
onto the fabrics, which were placed on a hard plastic surface. Blood
was dropped from each height sequentially, but the order of
specimens within a drop height was randomised. All drops were
ﬁlmed using a Phantom V12 high-speed video (6273 fps and
exposure 70 ms). The high-speed video was subsequently analysed
using Phantom Camera Control software6 to measure the droplet
diameter and impact velocity for each drop height (Table 2). The
mean diameter of the drops for all experiments was 3.3  0.17 mm.
Five repeats were taken at each velocity on each fabric resulting in
a total of 90 specimens.
Bloodstains were photographed using a Nikon D3300 camera
under the following conditions: wet (30 s following the drop
event) and dry on the technical face and on the technical rear of the
fabric (24 h later).
Dry specimens were analysed using a Nikon XTH225 micro
Computed Tomography (mCT) scanner7 (Table 3). For the mCT
scans, the fabric specimens were cropped to a width just greater
than the parent bloodstain to increase the resolution of the scans,
and mounted on a foam block. Foam was used as it was a different
density from the fabric, and so the scanned image of the foam could
easily be removed from the CT data during post-processing. The
mCT scanner was used to investigate the internal structure of the
bloodstains as materials of different densities attenuate X-rays

differently. The iron in the blood is the densest material on the
blood-soaked fabric, and therefore the iron-rich bloodstains can be
seen as separate from the less dense fabric background.
The mCT data was manually reconstructed in CT pro 3D8
(Table 3). The reconstructed data was then analysed in VGStudio
Max9 and a 2D image of the 3D reconstruction of the bloodstain
saved. Two-dimensional cross-sections were saved with a slice
distance of 0.05 mm. Cross sections were obtained through the
depth of the fabric in the warp and weft directions (Fig. 1).
The densest areas in the CT scans, where there is the most iron
present, can be seen as the brightest areas within the cross-
sections and 2D image of the 3D reconstruction. Fig. 2 is a
representation of the different ways in which the blood may be
seen in the mCT cross-sections.
The areas of the wet and dry technical face and technical rear of
the parent bloodstains were obtained using the in-built tools in
ImageJ10 . Brieﬂy, the image was converted to binary so the parent
bloodstain was black against the white background. The area of the
bloodstain was measured using the ‘analyse particles’ function. The
outline of the measured area was compared to the original
photograph to ensure spatter not connected to the parent
bloodstain was not included in the measurement.
Two specimens from each fabric and velocity combination were
examined using a Hitachi SU3500 SEM with the EDAX TEAM
microanalysis system11 (15 kV, 60 Pa). Background images were
taken of the fabric (50) and of a yarn removed from the fabric
(75) as well as of the dry bloodstains (42 and 250).
To determine whether the blood drop impact velocity or fabric
mass per unit area had a statistically signiﬁcant effect on the wet
and dry bloodstain areas, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) (IBM
SPSS statistics version 22) was carried out. Statistical results are
only reported in the results section if signiﬁcant. Tukey’s HSD test
identiﬁed which variables or levels contributed towards any
signiﬁcant effects. To ensure that these statistical tests were viable,
equality of variances and normality of data were checked.
3. Results and discussion
The resultant bloodstains from the passive blood drops were
examined to compare the interaction between the blood and the
fabric among the different fabrics and velocities.
Overall, the light calico produced the largest mean dry
bloodstain area, and the medium the smallest, although this is
not true across all velocities (Fig. 3). For the medium and heavy
calico, a straight line ﬁtted to the mean data using a least square ﬁt
gave a strong correlation for both wet (medium: R2 = 0.98; heavy:
R2 = 0.92) and dry (medium: R2 = 0.93; heavy: R2 = 0.94) bloodstain
area with velocity. The correlation was lower for the light calico
(wet: R2 = 0.6; dry: R2 = 0.74). Univariate analysis of variance
(ANOVA) revealed impact velocity affected wet bloodstain area
(F17,72 = 49.314, p  0.01) and dry bloodstain area (F17,72 = 37.459,
p  0.01), the details of which are given in Table 4.
The results showed four groupings of velocities (Tables 4 and 5).
The specimens from 1.7 ms1 had dry bloodstains which were
small and dense, and so the specimens from this velocity were
looked at separately from the other velocities. The specimens from
2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms1 were grouped together as all fabrics had a
gradual increase in mean dry bloodstain area with velocity. The
medium calico had the smallest mean dry bloodstain area and the
light the largest. Within a fabric, the bloodstains appeared visually
similar. The specimens from 5.1 ms1 were looked at separately
from the other velocities as the medium calico had the largest
mean dry bloodstain area, and the light calico the smallest, which
only occurred at this velocity. Lastly, the specimens from 5.4 ms1
were also looked at separately from the other velocities. This
velocity resulted in a large increase in mean dry bloodstain area for
the light and heavy calicos.
3.1. Impact velocity 1.7 ms1
At an impact velocity of 1.7 ms1 the blood spread laterally on
the technical face of the fabric following the initial impact, with
little satellite stain and ligament formation (Fig. 4a–c). The blood
then retracted to form a small bloodstain (Fig. 5a).
The small distance the blood spread laterally at impact resulted
in the blood remaining pooled on the surface of all fabrics in the
wet bloodstain photographs (Fig. 5). The blood pooled on the
surface of the fabric refers to the blood which remained on the
surface of the fabric following impact, and then either wicked into
the fabric or dried on the surface of the fabric.
A key ﬁnding in the current work was the effect of the
differences between the light, and the medium and heavy calicos
on the bloodstains resulting from the 1.7 ms1 impacts. On the
light calico the blood which was pooled on the surface of the fabric
was likely to enter the inter-yarn spaces, as these were largest for
the light calico owing to the differences in yarn linear density
among the three fabrics. In the CT cross-sections (Fig. 6a and b),
both the warp (marked ‘A’) and weft (marked ‘B’) yarns are soaked
in iron-rich blood. Once the blood was pooled in the inter-yarn
spaces, the blood would have been able to wick into the yarns from
all sides, ﬁlling the intra-yarn spaces. The volume of blood on the
fabric surface, and in the inter-yarn spaces, then provided a
reservoir for the blood to wick along the yarns after wetting. The
lower linear density of the warp yarns (14 tex) than the weft yarns
(18 tex) increased the amount of wicking in the former (Figs. 6c,
marked ‘C’ and 8 a marked ‘A’). The lower yarn linear density meant
less blood was required to wet the yarn, and then ﬁll the volume of
the yarn, so the blood was able to wick further.
On the medium and heavy calicos more blood dried on the
surface of the fabric than for the light calico (Fig. 7a–c). Compared
to the light calico, the higher yarn linear density and smaller inter-
yarn spaces of the medium and heavy calico meant it was more
difﬁcult for the blood to ﬁll the inter-yarn spaces and surround the
yarns. The blood pooled on the surface of the fabric and then
wicked vertically through the yarns under gravity from the
technical face towards the technical rear. This resulted in both
the warp (marked ‘A) and weft (marked ‘B’) yarns being soaked in
iron-rich blood (Fig. 8), with blood also remaining on the surface of
the fabric (Fig. 8, marked ‘C’). Although blood was unlikely to have
penetrated the fabric as a result of the impact [27], the blood
wicked through to the technical rear of the fabric prior to the
bloodstain drying (Fig. 7e and f). Although the blood was in the
intra-yarn spaces, it did not wick along the yarns to the same

extent as the light calico. This was owing to the amount of time it
would take to fully wet the high linear density yarns of the medium
and heavy calico as the blood was only soaking through from the
technical face of the fabric. When investigating spatter bloodstains
on three 100% cotton knitted fabrics with different yarn linear
densities, as with the current work on calico, it was found the
smallest bloodstains were on the fabric with the greatest yarn
linear density [28]. The greater the yarn linear density, the more air
spaces there are between the ﬁbres, therefore the more blood
which is required to fully wet the yarns, before wicking can occur.
The blood remaining on the surface of the fabric would dry before
much wicking along the yarns was able to occur. 1.7 ms1 is the
only velocity where the heavy calico specimens had the smallest
mean dry bloodstain area (Fig. 3). As the predominant method by
which the bloodstains are being created on the medium and heavy
calico at this velocity is wicking vertically into the fabric under
gravity, the greater yarn linear density of the heavy than either the
medium or light calico would reduce the ability of the blood to
wick into the heavy calico.
On all three fabrics for 1.7 ms1 impacts the blood which
remained on the surface of the fabric dried in the manner of the
coffee ring effect (Fig. 8a–c, marked ‘B’) [29,30]. The coffee ring
effect occurs in many colloidal ﬂuids when the solutes move to the
pinned edge of the liquid drop to compensate for evaporative
losses [31]. This results in a higher concentration of particulates at
the edge of the drop than the centre, and is evidenced by a ring of
dense blood surrounding the parent bloodstain.
As a larger volume of blood remained on the surface of the
medium and heavy calicos than the light calico, the coffee ring
effect was more pronounced. The coffee ring effect occurred more
extensively for 1.7 ms1 impacts as blood pooled on the surface of
all fabrics following impact and dried before wicking occurred.

3.2. Impact velocities 2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms1
On the light calico there was a large increase in mean dry
bloodstain area from 27.6 mm2 at 1.7 ms1 to 41.4 mm2 at 2.9 ms1
(Fig. 3) owing to the increase in lateral spreading following impact
due to the increase in velocity. This increase in lateral spreading
resulted in no blood remaining pooled on the surface of the light
calico (Fig. 9a). The blood instead penetrated the yarns through to
the technical rear of the light calico (Fig. 9g, marked ‘A’) some of
which occurred closely following impact, with wicking further
increasing the technical rear bloodstain area [27]. The amount of
blood which penetrated to the technical rear following impact has
previously been found to increase with an increase in impact
velocity from 1.9 ms1 to 4.2 ms1 (7.2 mm2–18.6 mm2) [27].
For the light calico, the CT scans of all the bloodstains at this
velocity showed neither the warp nor weft yarns contained a large
amount of iron-rich blood (Fig. 10a and b), with only a patchy area
in the centre of the bloodstain (marked ‘A’). At the edge of the
bloodstain there is iron-rich blood primarily on the warp yarns
(marked ‘B’). Once the blood penetrated the intra-yarn spaces of
the light calico, wicking occurred along them to remove the
particulates (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) from
the centre of the bloodstain towards the edge, removing any blood
which was originally pooled in the inter-yarn spaces (Fig. 10c,

marked ‘C’). Any particulates which remained in the centre of the
bloodstain were spread out owing to the larger dry bloodstain
areas at these velocities than at 1.7 ms1. The amount of wicking
which was occurring at 2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms1 on the light calico
resulted in similar mean dry bloodstain areas at these three
velocities (41.4, 44.0 and 48.7 mm2 respectively) and reduced the
correlation of mean dry bloodstain area and velocity.
The dry bloodstains formed on the light (thinnest) calico
specimens from impact velocities of 2.9, 4.1 and 4.9 ms1 had a
larger mean area than the medium and heavy calico specimens
(Fig. 3, Table 4). However, there was only one statistically signiﬁcant
difference in dry bloodstain area among the fabrics at any of these
three velocities. From an impact velocity of 2.9 ms1 (F2,12 = 3.951,
p  0.05), the light calico was statistically signiﬁcantly larger than
the medium calico. A larger bloodstain on a thinner fabric was also
seen when bloodstains on a blend (65% polyester/35% cotton) plain
woven fabric were compared to those on 100% cotton and 100%
polyester fabrics which had greater thickness and mass per unit area
[12]. Although ﬁbre content may also have had an effect in this
previous work, it was suggested that the large bloodstain size was
caused by the blood spreading laterally over the fabric, rather than
over and through the fabric [12].
For the medium and heavy calico, blood remained pooled on the
surface of the fabric when the blood impacted at a velocity of
2.9 ms1 or 4.1 ms1 (Fig. 9b and c). At an impact velocity of
4.9 ms1 no blood remained pooled on the fabric surface owing to
the greater distance the blood spread laterally at impact. The
increase in lateral spreading also increased the mean dry
bloodstain area with velocity (Fig. 3, Table 4).
Although the blood could not penetrate the medium calico as
easilyas the lightcalicoowing tothe smaller inter-yarn spaces, all the
CT scans of the medium calico bloodstains at this velocity showed

--- PAGE 8 ---

iron-rich blood did wick into both the warp and weft yarns. This
occurred primarily on the sections of the yarns which were on the
technical face of the fabric (Fig.10d and e, marked ‘A’). The blood was
therefore penetrating the yarns from the reservoir pooled on the
surface of the fabric. However, the high twist level of the medium
calico (756/756) compared to the heavy calico (650/624) impeded
the wicking of the blood along the intra-yarn spaces, resulting in the
smallest mean dry bloodstain area at each of these velocities.
The mCT cross-sections for all the heavy calico specimens at this
velocity indicated very little iron-rich blood in the centre of the
bloodstain (Fig. 10g and h). Any iron-rich blood in the centre of the
bloodstain (marked ‘A’) is primarily on the warp yarns, and the
blood has not soaked all the way through to the centre of the yarns
(Fig. 10g, ‘A’). This is possibly due to the higher linear density for
the heavy than the light and medium calicos. The blood dried
before penetrating to the centre of the yarns, shown by the volume
of dry blood which remained on the surface of the fabric (Figs. 9f,
marked ‘A’, Fig. 10i marked ‘B’), ﬁlling the inter-yarn spaces
(Fig. 10i, marked ‘C’). At an impact velocity of 4.2 ms1 it has
previously been found that no blood penetrated through to the
technical rear of the heavy calico at impact, while blood did
penetrate both the medium and light calicos [27].
3.3. Impact velocity 5.1 ms1
5.1 ms1 was the only velocity where the largest mean dry
bloodstain area was on the medium calico, and the smallest on the
light calico (Fig. 3, Table 4). The difference in mean dry bloodstain
area at 5.1 ms1 was not statistically signiﬁcant (the difference
between the medium and light calico was only 5 mm2).
For all specimens from an impact velocity of 5.1 ms1 both the
warp (marked ‘A’) and weft (marked ‘B’) yarns were almost
completely soaked in iron-rich blood (Fig. 11a, b, d, e, g and h),
where the full shape of the yarn is seen (Fig. 2). Less blood was visible
on the surface of the yarns at 5.1 ms1 (Fig. 11c, f, i) than at 4.1 ms1
(Fig.10c, f, i). As the blood was able to penetrate the intra-yarn spaces
for all three fabrics at this velocity, regardless of the yarn linear
density, this would suggest that the increase in velocity to 5.1 ms1
enabled the blood to penetrate into the yarns at impact, ﬁlling the
intra-yarn spaces. Evidence for a higher velocity forcing blood to
penetrate into the intra- and inter- yarn spaces has previously been
seen when passive bloodstains on a 100% cotton rib knit fabric were
examined using a mCT scanner [15]. In this previous work, the
bloodstains formed from a velocity of 5.3 ms1 reached their
maximum extent closer to the technical face of the fabric than the
middle velocity (4.5 ms1), with a mean maximum cross-sectional
area larger than either of the other two velocities investigated in this
previous work (3.2, 4.5 ms1) [15]. The higher velocity appeared to
therefore be forcing the blood intothe intra-and inter-yarnspaces,as
occurred on the calico fabrics from an impact velocity of 5.1 ms1.
Onthelightcalicothemeandrybloodstainareadecreasedfrom48.7
mm2 at 4.9 ms1 to 42.5 mm2 at 5.1 ms1. The coefﬁcient of variation
(CV) for the light calico at 5.1 ms1 (8%) was lower than at 4.9 ms1
(25%). This was possibly due to a greater amount of wicking at 4.9 ms1
increasing the variability in the dry bloodstain area. The amount of
wicking in a specimen would be dependent on variations within the

fabric and yarns [32] and therefore would differ between specimens.
When the area of the bloodstain is more dependent onwicking than on
the distance the blood spread laterally at impact, greater variability
among specimens within that velocity will be seen. The reduced
wicking at 5.1 ms1, indicated by less variability among specimens,
resulted in the smaller mean dry bloodstain area at this velocity.
The mean dry bloodstain area on the heavy calico decreased
slightly despite the increase in impact velocity from 45.7 mm2 at
4.9 ms1 to 45.5 mm2 at 5.1 ms1. There is little evidence of dense
blood on the surface of the heavy calico in the dry bloodstains
(Fig. 12c). This was due to the blood penetrating the yarns rather
than remaining on the surface of the fabric. Although the blood was

then in the intra-yarn spaces, the high yarn linear density of the
heavy calico precluded wicking.
The medium calico was the only fabric where the mean dry
bloodstain area increased with the increase in velocity from 42.8
mm2 at 4.9 ms1 to 47.5 mm2 at 5.1 ms1. The CV also increased
from 13% to 19% suggesting a greater amount of wicking was
occurring, as this would increase the inconsistency of the dry
bloodstain area among specimens [32]. The largest technical rear

--- PAGE 12 ---

bloodstain on the medium calico was seen on the specimens from a
velocity of 5.1 ms1 (Fig. 12e). Blood penetrated the yarns through
to the technical rear of the medium calico across the entire
bloodstain and then wicked along the yarns as the blood was
already in the intra-yarn spaces. The lower yarn linear density for
the medium than the heavy calico meant more wicking occurred in
the former.
3.4. Impact velocity 5.4 ms1
The light calico specimens had the largest mean dry bloodstain
area and the medium the smallest from a velocity of 5.4 ms1
(Fig. 3, Table 4). The difference in mean dry bloodstain area among
fabrics 
at 
5.4 ms1
was 
statistically 
signiﬁcantly 
different
(F2,12 = 9.32, p  0.01). The mean dry bloodstain area for the light
calico (59.7 mm2) was signiﬁcantly larger than the medium
(43.3 mm2). The mean dry bloodstain area for the heavy calico
(53.5 mm2) was not signiﬁcantly different.
For the light calico specimens from 5.4 ms1, the blood spread a
large distance following impact as shown in the increase in mean
wet bloodstain area from 43.6 mm2 at 5.1 ms1 to 64.9 mm2 at
5.4 ms1. The distance the blood drop spread on the surface of the
fabric following impact depended on the kinetic energy at impact.
The kinetic energy was converted to surface energy causing the
spreading [20]. The increase in impact velocity from 1.7 ms1 to
5.4 ms1 resulted in an increase in kinetic energy of over 900%,
hence resulting in more spreading on the surface of the fabric.
No blood remained pooled on the surface of the light calico
specimens from 5.4 ms1 impacts (Fig. 13a). A large amount of
blood penetrated through to the technical rear of the fabric
(Fig. 13g). Iron-rich blood penetrated through the entire thickness
of the warp yarns (Fig. 14a, marked ‘A’) while only coating the weft
yarns (Fig. 14b, marked ‘B’). The predilection for the warp yarns
owing to their lower linear density (14 compared to 18 tex) can be
seen around the edge of the dry technical face (Fig. 13d marked ‘A’)
and technical rear (Fig. 13g marked ‘A’) bloodstain and the 2D
image of the 3D CT reconstruction (Fig. 13j). As the warp yarn on
the light calico was soaked in blood it was possible for the blood to
wick along the intra-yarn spaces within the yarns, increasing the
bloodstain area.

yarns, and ‘B’ the blood soaked weft yarns.

--- PAGE 13 ---

The mean technical rear bloodstain area for the medium calico
decreased from 27.8 mm2 at 5.1 ms1 to 15.1 mm2 at 5.4 ms1.
However, the specimens from an impact velocity of 5.4 ms1 were
the only specimens on the medium calico where the blood
completely penetrated to the technical rear of the fabric (Fig. 13h,
marked ‘B’). The blood coated the warp and weft yarns (Fig.13d and
e, marked ‘A’) rather than penetrating through to the centre of
them. Therefore, the blood on the technical rear of the medium
calico was forced through the inter-yarn spaces and around the
yarns at impact, as the higher twist level of the medium calico
reduced the ability of the blood to penetrate into the yarns
themselves. Some blood also remained pooled on the surface of the
medium calico (Fig. 13b). The blood on the surface dried before
being able to fully wick into the intra-yarn spaces, therefore
reducing the amount of wicking which occurred along them. The
greater yarn twist of the medium than the heavy and the light
calicos reduced the ability of the blood to wick into and along the
intra-yarn spaces, reducing the dry bloodstain area.
For the heavy, as for the medium calico, iron-rich blood coated
both the warp and weft yarns (Fig. 14g and h), although blood did
not completely penetrate through to the technical rear of the fabric
(compare Fig. 13i–h). The blood remained more on the surface of
the heavy calico than either the medium or light calicos owing to
the higher yarn linear density. This is evidenced by a greater
amount of iron-rich blood towards the technical face of the fabric
in the mCT cross-sections (Fig. 14g and h) and the ring of dense
blood which occurred on the surface of the fabric (Fig. 13l).
Therefore, with the increase in impact velocity to 5.4 ms1 the
blood spread laterally across the surface of the heavy calico, as
opposed to penetrating through to the technical rear of the fabric
as for the medium calico. This resulted in a larger mean dry
bloodstain area for the heavy than the medium calico.
3.5. All velocities
A summary of the differences in results between the different
impact velocities and fabrics is given in Table 5.
4. Conclusions
Passivebloodstainswerecreatedonthreemassperunitareas(light:
85 g/m2, medium: 164 g/m2 and heavy: 225 g/m2) of 100% cotton plain
woven calico. Six drop heights were used, resulting in six impact
velocities (1.7, 2.9, 4.1, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.4 ms1). The use ofmCTenabled the
internal structure of the bloodstains to be assessed. This provided an
understanding of where the blood was within the bloodstain, and
whetherithadpenetratedorcoatedtheyarns,whichwasimperativeto
understanding the interaction of the blood and the fabric.
The bloodstains varied depending on the type of fabric and the
velocity with which the blood impacted. Overall, dry bloodstain
area increased with impact velocity, although this was not
consistent across all three fabrics. The light calico generally had
the largest mean dry bloodstain area but had a lower correlation
with velocity. This was due to the low yarn linear density of the
light calico which reduced the volume the blood had to ﬁll;
therefore the blood wicked further along the yarns. The correlation
with velocity was greater for the medium and heavy calicos. Less
wicking along the intra-yarn spaces occurred, and so the dry
bloodstain area was more dependent on the distance the blood
spread laterally following impact, which increased with the

increase in impact velocity. At a slow impact velocity (1.7 ms1) the
blood pooled on the surface of the fabric wicked slowly into the
warp and weft yarns under gravity, while at a faster impact velocity
(e.g. 4.1 ms1) the particulates were more spread out within the
bloodstain, resulting in very different CT scans between fast and
slow impact velocities. This is important to note for forensic
science, as in some circumstances it may be possible to ascertain
something of the area of origin of the bloodstain on the basis of a
fast or slow impact velocity.
For forensic science, it is also important to note that fabric mass
per unit area needs to be taken into account when analysing
bloodstains on fabrics. When comparing bloodstains between two
fabrics of identical ﬁbre content and weave structure, the fabric
with the lower mass per unit area may produce a larger bloodstain
than that of the higher mass per unit area irrespective of the
velocity with which the blood impacted.
