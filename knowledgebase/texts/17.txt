Purpose: The detection of bloodstains at crime scenes is extremely useful in forensic investigations. This study 
aimed to investigate the effects of washing temperature, fabric type, fabric color, and stain age (time from 
staining to laundering) on the detection and identification of bloodstains on fabrics after washing. 
Material and method: A total of 240 fabrics (4 different colors and 5 different types) were stained with blood and 
washed in 4 different washing temperatures with 3 different lag times. The evaluations of fabric images were 
performed using the FLS system (Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems®) on a total of 
1200 images using 5 different wavelengths and filter options. The bloodstained areas of the fabric pieces were 
then excised, and the hemoglobin presence was analyzed using the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test. 
Results: The analyses of laundered samples using the FLS system revealed that the best images were obtained 
from velvet, cotton fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics, in that order. Except for polyester fabrics, the SERATEC® 
HemDirect hemoglobin screening test, which was used to detect bloodstains on fabrics, showed positive results 
after washing at low temperatures (approximately 15 ◦C and 30 ◦C). At higher temperatures (60 ◦C and 90 ◦C), 
the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test yielded negative results. 
Conclusion: The fabric type and color played a crucial role in stain detection using the FLS system on the 
laundered fabrics. The FLS system and the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test revealed that stain age had a 
limited effect on the stain’s detectability.   
1. Introduction 
Detection of biological stains at the crime scene and DNA extraction 
from these samples are critical steps in identifying the offender or victim 
of the incident. Bloodstains are among the most common stains found at 
crime scenes and have a significant forensic value in terms of criminal 
justice.1–3 Bloodstains can often be found on different fabrics, such as 
clothes, sheets, or blankets, belonging to individuals involved in a 
forensic case. The characteristics of fabrics, including thickness, 
weaving pattern, content, and color, affect the formation of blood­
stains.4 These factors may influence the visibility and detectability of 
bloodstains at the crime scene. 
Even when blood is visible at the crime scene, the visibility of 
bloodstains may need enhancement if it is present in less quantity, not 
clearly visible on the surface, or has been dragged by objects, such as 
shoes.5 In addition, bloodstained clothing or items may be destroyed or 
washed after a while to hide the crime.1 
Although there are numerous methods for detecting bloodstains, 
especially in cases where samples are scarce, important evidence such as 
DNA may be compromised by DNA degradation due to destruction of the 
bloodstained samples.5–7 The most commonly observed body fluid at a 
crime scene is blood.7 Many crimes, ranging from murder to assault, 
involve blood.8 Bloodstains can absorb light at wavelength 415 nm.9 The 
Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems (FLS) 
system readily allows visualization of the location of the stains and 
documentation as scientific evidence, which can be then presented to 
the court.10 The FLS system is a nondestructive and noninvasive method 
based on the absorptive and photoluminescent properties of the bio­
logical stains.10,11 As it permits rapid scanning of large surfaces at the 
crime scene, using it before advanced verification methods saves time.6

After the stain has been located, various methods are employed to 
confirm the stain prior to performing DNA analysis. Immunoassay 
methods, which are frequently used in forensic laboratories, are per­
formed for the quick and reliable detection of the presence of hemo­
globin.7,12 The visible spectrum of hemoglobin consists of three main 
peaks. In fresh bloodstains, hemoglobin appears as oxyhemoglobin, with 
the strongest peak of oxyhemoglobin at 415 nm, known as the “Soret” 
band or “γ” band.13 
The increase in societal awareness has led to the increase in the 
tendency of perpetrators to disrupt the crime scene. Criminals frequently 
wear gloves to avoid leaving their fingerprints or DNA, and they use 
bleach to clean up the crime scene. A crime scene can be cleaned to 
destroy evidence of the incident, and surfaces that serve as evidence can 
be painted.14 Many studies on the detectability of semen and bloodstains 
(Table 1) on washed clothing were conducted to gain further insights 
into the clarification of such cases.15–20 In two studies, Karadayı et al. 
reported that semen stains on fabrics can be detected even after 
washing,15 and the detection rate increases as the age of the stain in­
creases.16 However, further studies are needed to determine the 
detectability of bloodstains in a wider range of fabric types and colors 
after washing in different lag times and washing conditions. Arjun et al. 
found that the detectability of bloodstains after washing was highest in 
cotton and brasso fabric types.1 However, little is known about the 
detectability of a bloodstain after machine washing a textile product.18 
Studies conducted on bloodstains have primarily used luminol to 
investigate the visibility factors in washed fabrics. To the best of our 
knowledge, no detailed study has been conducted to investigate the 
effect of the lag times of bloodstains on different types of fabrics prior to 
washing in determining the stain location and confirming the stain using 
the FLS system. 
In this study, we aimed to reveal the effect of stain lag times before 
washing on the detection and identification of bloodstains on laundered 
clothes. Using a newly developed UV-VIS-IR imaging system with IR 
feature, we also aimed to comprehensively (four different colors of each 
of five different fabrics) confirm the role of other factors (washing 
temperature, fabric type, and color) that have been shown to have an 
effect on the detection of washed bloodstains on fabrics. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Sampling 
A sample of 25 cc of fresh blood was taken from 6 healthy adult 
volunteer donors. To mimic blood samples obtained from a crime scene, 
the samples were not placed in EDTA tubes, and bloodstains were 
quickly created with Pastor pipettes without allowing blood to coagu­
late. The detectability of the bloodstain was evaluated based on the lag 
times of bloodstains, washing temperatures, and fabric types and colors. 
Given the possibility of encountering fabrics with different structural 
properties at a crime scene, commonly used fabric types and colors with 
varying properties were preferred in the study. A bloodstain was created 
using 20 different fabrics, including 5 different fabric types (cotton, 
polyester, denim, velvet, and fleece) and 4 different color tones (2 light 
and 2 dark). Taking into account 3 different lag times and 4 different 
washing temperatures, 240 pieces of fabric (3 × 4 × 20 = 240) were 
collected. To determine the location of the bloodstains that would form 
on each fabric after washing, a circle with a diameter of 5 cm was drawn 
using a pencil, which would not be erased in water. The midpoint of the 
marked area on the fabrics was stained with 500 μL fresh blood. 
Considering the delays in incident reporting and the availability of 
biological evidence, the fabrics were dried at room temperature after 
staining and kept in 3 different paper envelopes for 24 h, 1 week, and 1 
month, respectively, prior to performing the washing protocol. As a 
result, three groups were obtained. The graphs were created using IBM 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 25.00. 
This study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of the 
University of Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Fac­
ulty (REC: 86133). 
2.2. Laundering protocol 
The bloodstained fabrics, which were kept for 24 h, 1 week, and 1 
month under appropriate conditions, were washed in a household 
washing machine (Bosch Maxx 8) at 1000 rpm and 4 different temper­
atures: ~15 ◦C (tap water temperature at the time of laundering), 30 ◦C, 
60 ◦C, and 90 ◦C. Each bloodstained fabric was washed with 65-mL 
enzyme-based liquid laundry agent (Bingo liquid laundry detergent)

by grouping the fabrics with the same lag time and color tone. No 
detergent was used at 15 ◦C. To prevent cross contamination among the 
groups, the washing machine was run without fabrics between washes. 
Fabric softener and laundry bleach were not used in any of the washes. 
After the washing process, the fabrics were dried at room tempera­
ture overnight and the marked areas were examined. 
2.3. Testing for blood stains 
To determine the persistence of the bloodstains after washing, each 
stain (240 samples) created within the marked area on each fabric was 
investigated using the FLS system. The bloodstained area was excised, 
and the presence of hemoglobin was determined using the SERATEC® 
HemDirect hemoglobin test (SERATEC Gesellschaft für Biotechnologie 
mbH, G¨ottingen, Germany). 
2.4. Examination of bloodstains with the FLS system (Forenscope) 
An advanced forensic light source system was used to determine the 
location of bloodstains on fabrics and investigate stain persistence after 
the laundering procedure. The Forenscope-Mobile Multispectral 
Tablet® (Forenscope EUROPE) was used for the examination, which has 
a built-in imaging, recording system, and portable forensic light source 
system with Android operating system that can emit light at different 
wavelengths, allowing the use of different filters. For each sample, the 
following five different lights + filter options were used:  
- White Light (6500 k) + VIS filter + Color Camera Mode  
- Violet Light (410–420 nm) + BP415 Filter (BandPass 415 nm Filter) 
+ Color Camera Mode  
- Violet Light (410–420 nm) + BP415 Filter (BandPass 415 nm Filter) 
+ Monochrome Camera 
Mode.  
- Violet Light (410–420 nm) + BP415 Filter (BandPass 415 nm Filter) 
+ Invert Camera Mode  
- Infrared 840–860 nm + IR filter + Monochrome Camera Mode 
All fabrics were photographed and recorded using Mobil Multi­
spectral UV-VIS-IR Imaging Systems®. A total of 1200 (5 × 240 = 1200) 
images were obtained for 5 different shots based on the different com­
binations of filters and wavelengths of light for each sample. To take 
photographs from a standard distance and prevent external light from 
affecting the images, a dark room supplied with the system and 
customized for the device was used. After photographing, the images 
from the camera were transferred to a computer in JPEG format and 
sorted according to variable characteristics to facilitate evaluation. 
From the obtained images, three researchers (BK, SK, and DO) selected 
four reference images (negative, weak, moderate, and strong images). 
Based on the reference images, the same three researchers indepen­
dently evaluated and categorized the captured images into the four 
groups, taking into account the visibility of the stain in the images. If a 
unanimous decision was not made for a sample, the opinion of the 
majority of the researchers for that image was considered. For example, 
if the first researcher evaluated the image as strong, the second 
researcher as moderate, and the third researcher as strong, the result was 
recorded as strong. To assess the intraobserver agreement, 60 randomly 
selected images were reevaluated by the first author (DO). The same 
images were evaluated separately by the second and third authors (SK 
and BK), and interobserver agreement was tested on 120 assessments. 
Cohen’s kappa test21 was performed to calculate the intraobserver and 
interobserver reliability. 
2.5. Confirmatory blood test and evaluation 
The presence of hemoglobin on the washed bloodstains in all groups 
was analyzed using the SERATEC® Hemdirect test. According to the kit 
manufacturer’s (SERATEC) instructions, the cut underwear pieces were 
kept in 1 ml buffer solution for 10 min. Approximately 100 μl (three 
drops) of this solution was added to the sample well. Results were noted 
after the end of the 10-min incubation period. The presence of a pink line 
in the test region (T) indicates that the test is positive. Results based on 
the status of the pink line was interpreted according to modification of 
Holtk¨otter et al. Classification.22 These categories were defined as 
“++++,” “+++,” “++,” and “+” in the presence of the strong T-line 
with sharp edges, T-line with sharp edges, light T-line with one sharp 
edge, and faint T-line, respectively, and clear result window was noted 
as negative. 
3. Results 
Cohen’s kappa value used for measuring intraobserver agreement for 
evaluation stages was 0.93, indicating almost perfect agreement. Like­
wise, interobserver agreement (kappa value: 0.74) was substantial 
accordance. 
The results of the FLS system examinations on the samples are shown 
in the Supplementary, and the results of the SERATEC® Hemdirect he­
moglobin test are shown in Table 2. 
3.1. Forensic light source system 
The results obtained from the FLS system analysis of the bloodstained 
fabrics washed with different washing protocols revealed that the 
strongest to the weakest images were obtained in velvet, cotton, polar 
fleece, denim, and polyester for all lag times (Fig. 1A). 
In terms of the prominence of bloodstains after washing, the FLS 
system produced a better image in light-colored fabrics compared to 
dark-toned fabrics. When all storage times and washing temperatures 
were considered, cotton white and cream, velvet white and cream, and 
fleece white and cream colored fabrics produced the best results 
(Figs. 1–3). 
It was observed that the rate of detectability and image quality using

the FLS system decreased in all fabric types and tones with the increase 
in the washing temperature (Supplementary, Fig. 1B). 
The location of the bloodstain could be determined after the laun­
dering procedure in 72% images evaluated in the study (Supplemen­
tary). Considering the washing conditions and lag times of bloodstains, 
the least successful FLS system analysis results were observed in black- 
colored fabrics (Fig. 1C; Fig. 3A and B). Images were usually obtained 
in dark-colored fabrics using IR light (Fig. 4). 
The lag time of the bloodstained fabrics before washing had an effect 
on the quality of detectability in the FLS system analysis. The best results 
obtained by the FLS system analysis were observed in laundered 
bloodstained fabrics with 1 month of lag time (Fig. 1A; Fig. 2; Fig 3A; 
Fig. 5). 
When the images displayed and recorded for each sample using 
different wavelengths and filter systems of the Forenscope device were 
evaluated, the best images were obtained using the following 
parameters:  
- Violet Light (410–420 nm) + BP415 Filter (BandPass 415 nm Filter) 
+ Color Camera Mode,

3.2. Serological testing 
Regardless of the stain retention time, the SERATEC® HemDirect 
hemoglobin test produced a strong positive result in all fabric types 
when no detergent was used at water temperature of ~15 ◦C. 
With a 1-month lag period, strong positive results were observed in 
cotton, denim, and fleece fabrics that were washed with detergent at a 
water temperature of 30 ◦C, whereas weak positive results were 
observed in velvet fabric (Table 2). 
It was observed that when the water temperature was higher than 
60 ◦C, the bloodstain produced a negative result regardless of its age 
(Table 2). 
4. Discussion 
Blood and blood-contaminated items are frequently encountered 
during a crime scene investigation, and extracting DNA from such 
samples in the later stages of the investigation is critical to procure ev­
idence regarding the incident and the criminal. However, criminals 
often try to clean up the blood at the crime scene in order to destroy 
evidence, and in some cases, they attempt to destroy evidence by 
washing bloodstained clothing. Previous studies based on the determi­
nation of location of the bloodstain after the washing process are usually 
conducted using chemical substances, such as luminol. Although the FLS 
systems have been shown to be effective in detecting biological 
stains,11,12 the number of studies that employed the FLS system is 
limited. Furthermore, the effect of blood persistence and stain lag time 
of washed clothes on the detection rate of evidence has not been fully 
explored. Therefore, we used a cutting-edge Forenscope light source 
system (Forenscope), which is more efficient than the traditional 
forensic light source systems. 
In the present study, the best FLS system image was obtained in 
velvet, cotton, polar fleece, denim, and polyester fabrics. Gupta et al. 
obtained pronounced result in hand-washed cotton fabric using the 
luminol test.2 In the study conducted by Edler et al. using luminol, after 
washing some fabric by hand and some by machine, the least blood 
residue was observed in micro fleece fabrics (24.2%), whereas macro­
scopic bloodstains were detected in all the cotton denim samples.17 
Among all samples, the presence of blood was detected macroscopically 
in 57.2% samples after the washing process, whereas a reaction rate of 
95.9% was observed in all samples by the luminol technique; this rate 
was 88.6% in the control samples.17 In the present study, the stain 
location was detected after washing in 72% evaluated images. The 
image quality obtained after washing may have been influenced by the 
Fig. 4. Forensic light source (ForenScope) examinations at IR wavelength of bloodstains on different dark-toned fabric types after various laundering procedures.

amount of blood used in the formation of the stains. Edler et al. used 10 
mL of blood, whereas 500 mL of blood was used in the present study. 
Stojanovi´c et al. reported positive results with Hemastix® and Bluestar® 
in washings at 30 ◦C, 60 ◦C, and 90 ◦C in cotton fabrics.23 
Edler et al., citing Grifford et al., reported that after 9 h of soaking in 
still water and 30 min of washing in moving water, no macroscopic 
bloodstain was observed on the fabrics with blood that were kept from a 
few seconds to a maximum of 9 h. Edler et al. reported that lag times of 1 
day and 1 week do not affect the reaction to luminol after washing.17 In 
our study, stain images were obtained in 62%, 72%, and 81% fabrics 
that were washed after 24 h, 1 week, and 1 month of lag period. Based on 
these results, it was concluded that the percentage of detectability in­
creases with the lag time prior to washing. Hofmann et al. reported 
better stain images because the lag time before washing increases in 
their study using the luminol method. A weaker luminol reaction was 
reported after washing in fabrics that were kept for 24 h than in fabrics 
that were kept for 3 or more days.18 
In the present study, when all the lag times and washing tempera­
tures were considered, favorable results could not be obtained in the 
polyester fabric owing to its poor absorbency and moisture retention 
properties. Similarly, in the study by Edler et al., the least chem­
iluminescence intensity was observed in polyester fabrics, probably due 
to the failure of hemoglobin adhesion to the polyester.17 Our study re­
sults are consistent with this finding. 
A study that used poly light found that the stain image quality was 
poor due to high absorption of blood by polar fleece; however, a better 
image was obtained on light-colored cotton fabric.24 Hofmann et al. 
used the luminol method and reported that stronger fluorescence was 
obtained in light-colored fabrics.18 The researchers suggested that 
fluorescence was absorbed in black-colored fabrics and other methods 
should be used in such cases.18 Similarly, in terms of the persistence of 
the bloodstain, a better image was obtained in this study with the FLS 
system in light-tone fabrics than in dark-tone fabrics after washing. 
Another study found that using infrared light sources was beneficial in 
dark fabrics.25 According to Chun-Yen Lin et al. study, which used 10 
different types of black fabrics, stains were visible up to 1/8 dilution 
with IR.25 However, Sterzik et al. reported that IR enhances the visibility 
of undiluted blood, but stain images cannot be obtained in diluted 
blood.26 In our study, the decreased detectability of stain age with IR, 
especially in dark-colored fabrics washed at high temperatures, supports 
this finding. Moreover, no favorable stain images could be obtained on 
the denim fabric at any of the three temperatures. 
Many factors influence the effectiveness of the FLS systems, 
including washing temperature, drying time, type of washing machine, 
type of sample investigated, fabric color and type, quantity of blood­
stain, and time elapsed between the crime commission and crime scene 
investigation.10,24 Edler et al. could not confirm the effect of washing 
water temperature on macroscopic cleaning. Although the lowest 
chemiluminescence was observed with washing at 95 ◦C, it was reported 
that stains remained more stable in samples washed at 60 ◦C.17 In the 
study conducted by Hofman et al. using luminol, it was reported that 
there was no major difference between washing of textile products at 
30 ◦C and 60 ◦C, and they also reported that detectability at 95 ◦C was 
significantly reduced.18 In their study on cotton fabric, wood, and tile 
surfaces, Miranda et al. reported that fluorescence intensity varies with 
sample age. The fluorescence was lower when the samples were moist, 
and the fluorescence was stable for 60 days on dry samples regardless of 
the surface where the stain sample was located.27 In the present study, 
stain visibility did not differ significantly between fabrics washed at 
30 ◦C and 60 ◦C for the 24-h lag period, but some difference was 
observed for 1-week lag times. Considering the lag period of a maximum 
of 1 week, our findings of 1-week lag times were consistent with those of 
Hofman et al.18 In the present study, the difference in fabrics subjected 
to a 1-month lag period was considerably higher than the others and was 
significantly reduced at 95 ◦C. We found that increase in washing tem­
perature decreased the rate of detectability and image quality using the 
FLS system. 
Bloodstains are the most visible at 415 nm with yellow glasses and at 
410 nm without glasses.24 Although we obtained a favorable image of 
blood at a wavelength of 415 nm, this was not the sole wavelength for 
effective forensic blood imaging. Favorable results were obtained using 
the violet and the monochrome option of the FLS System. Bloodstains on 
dark-colored fabrics should be located with an IR light. 
In some studies, a greenish discoloration has been reported after 
washing. Similar observation has been made in dried samples for up to 3 
days by Edler et al. and in bloodstained fabrics kept for 1 month in our 
study. Adair and Shaw in their studies using luminol suggested that this 
coloration could be due to the moisture in samples before washing.28 
Another hypothesis is that the laundry detergents can cause degradation 
of blood proteins, and the released sulfur compounds make the stain 
appear green,17 which seems more likely given that the stains are 
thoroughly dried before washing. 
Enzyme-based detergents can remove proteins, such as hemoglobin. 
In a study conducted by Arjun et al.1 with five different enzyme-based 
detergent brands, it was determined that Ariel® was the best deter­
gent for removing stains in the washing of bloody fabrics. As the washing 
agent used in our study (Bingo) is also an enzyme-based detergent, this 
could explain the reason behind the negative result of the SERATEC® 
HemDirect hemoglobin test, especially at the high temperatures. 
As shown in Table 2, positive results were obtained by the SER­
ATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test after 24 h, 1 week, and 1 month of 
lag periods in all fabric types washed with detergent-free water at 
~15 ◦C. Similar results were obtained in the FLS system analyses. This 
finding shows that a detergent-free wash at low temperature is sub­
stantially insufficient to completely remove bloodstains from any type of 
fabric. 
The strong positive results obtained in cotton, denim, and fleece 
fabrics washed with detergent at 30 ◦C water temperature after a 1- 
month lag period suggested that washing such fabrics at this tempera­
ture does not completely remove stains after long-term lag periods. 
However, it has been determined that when the water temperature rises 
above 60 ◦C, the bloodstain yields a negative result regardless of the 
stain age. This finding demonstrates that washing bloodstained fabrics 
at high temperatures and with detergent can completely remove the 
stain. In the samples where the stain was visible after washing but 
negative result was with the SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test, we 
suggest that this may be due to denatured hemoglobin, especially at high 
temperatures. 
In addition to being nondestructive and less time-limited than other 
methods, the expansion of the spectrum with evolving technology makes 
the FLS systems more useful. 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the FLS system analysis and the SERATEC® 
HemDirect hemoglobin test, it can be concluded that stain age has a 
limited effect on stain detectability. According to our findings, the fabric 
type and color were the most crucial features in the detectability of the 
stain using the FLS system on the laundered fabrics. Furthermore, the 
highest detectability was obtained at low washing temperatures and 
longer lag times, whereas bloodstains on light-colored fabrics were more 
detectable than on dark-colored fabrics. However, bloodstains that 
could not be detected at other wavelengths on dark fabrics could be 
detected by IR. The SERATEC® HemDirect hemoglobin test analyses 
revealed that the washing temperature was more significant factor than 
the lag time and fabric type.
