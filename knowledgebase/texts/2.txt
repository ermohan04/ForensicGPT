This is a data set of 61 blood spatter patterns scanned at high
resolution, generated by controlled impact events corresponding
to forensic beating situations. The spatter patterns were realized
with two test rigs, to vary the geometry and speed of the impact of
a solid object on a blood source – a pool of blood. The resulting
atomized blood droplets travelled a set distance towards a poster
board sheet, creating a blood spatter. Fresh swine blood was used;
its hematocrit and temperature were measured. Main parameters
of the study were the impact velocity and the distance between
blood source and target sheet, and several other parameters were
explored in a less systematic way. This new and original data set is
suitable for training or research purposes in the forensic discipline
of bloodstain pattern analysis.

Value of the data
 The data set can be used by researchers to test crime scene reconstruction models [1–3]. Brieﬂy,
these models pursue two purposes. First, they classify patterns with respect to their generation
mechanism (e.g. beating vs. shooting [4]). Second, they determine the region of origin of the blood
spatter [5,6]. Recently, the US National Academies emphasized [7] the need to develop more
accurate bloodstain pattern analysis methods, with stronger ﬂuid dynamics foundations. Accessi-
bility to large amounts of bloodstain patterns produced under controlled conditions is thus
important for the development of the needed science base [3,7–9]. The data in this manuscript
addresses the above issues by systematically documenting the experimental conditions.
 The data helps dissemination of blood spatters for teaching and instructional purposes. Indeed,
production and transport of blood spatters is cumbersome. A large space, the size of a habitation
room, is needed to create a realistic blood spatter; and care should be taken to have a reproducible
and realistic generation mechanism, be it a beating or a gunshot. Blood sourcing and handling is
not trivial either. Human blood for instance needs to be used under strict safety conditions because
of the risk of blood-borne diseases and pathogens. Since travelling across borders is common for
BPA instructors, both alternatives of travelling with blood spatters through customs or having the
blood spatters prepared at the site and time of the workshop involve logistic efforts and safety
risks. This database provides provide BPA instructors with a safe set of spatters ready to be printed
for their classes.
 This data set is new and original, and has not been published elsewhere.
 The experimental design and methods described in this manuscript can be readily reproduced and
used to create additional blood spatters.
1. Data
Blood spatters are a subset of bloodstain patterns, with stains generated by drops gone airborne
[1–3] before hitting the surface of a solid object called the target. Impact spatters are spatters where
blood is atomized by a force applied impulsively to the blood source [2]. Those features of atomization
and airborne transport are rarely observable in a crime scene, and distinguish spatters from other
bloodstain patterns, such as transfers where stains are produced by contact between the blood source
and the target.

Here, two types of impact events are exerted in a controlled manner on a pool of blood to generate
spatters representative of beating events. The scanned images of the spatters are provided as Sup-
plementary material. Some of the spatters contain well above 1000 stains, as that in Fig. 1.
The coordinates of the blood origin and the target on which the spatter occurs were measured, as
per the geometry in Fig. 2. The coordinate system originated from the bottom left corner of the wall
supporting the target. In selected experiments, two blood spatters were generated on the same target,
from two different locations, called regions of origin.
The conditions of each experiment are documented in a text ﬁle located in the same directory as
the spatter image, and summarized in Table 1, with the range of each parameter, and the reason for
documentation of each parameter. Fig. 3 provides a synthetic view of the main variables investigated,

the velocity of the impact that atomized the blood, and the distance between blood source and
spatter target.
2. Experimental design, materials and methods
Two tests rigs were used to create the impact blood spatters, as shown in Fig. 4. In the ﬁrst rig
(dowel and hockey puck, named ‘HP#’), blood is rapidly squeezed between a cylindrical wood dowel
(rod) and a ﬂat surface. The dowel rotates by the force of a rubber bungee, and hits a hockey puck
where the blood is located. Before impact, a rotating wood slab holds the dowel under tension, at an
initial angle controlled by a set of discrete dowel holes around which the slab is free to rotate. That
initial position isreported as the dowel height station and numbered 1–3 (3 corresponding to the
highest height and tension used in this data set). In the second rig, that with cylinders, named ‘C#’,
blood is squeezed between two ﬂat surfaces. The immobile bottom cylinder is 7.7 cm in diameter. The
Fig. 4. Two test rigs were designed to generate the impact beating blood spatters. Left, a dowel hits a hockey puck where the
blood is located. Right is a sliding cylinder device that squeezes the blood between two ﬂat surfaces. In both devices, the initial
position of the impactor controls the impact velocity. For scale information, the bottom cylinder on the right is about same
diameter as a hockey puck, 7.6 cm.

top cylinder is 3.8 cm in diameter, and able to freely fall along a vertical guide rod from a pre-set
height.
In the hockey puck rig, the impact contact occurs along a line; in the cylinders rig, across the ﬂat
surface of the top cylinder. The measured impact velocities are reported in Table 2. On both rigs, the
pool of blood has approximate volume of 1 mL blood, and thickness of 1 mm. To ensure reproducible
surface and wettability conditions, the impacting surfaces were rinsed with isopropanol, then deio-
nized water, and dried before each trial. In selected experiments, a soaked polyurethane foam was
used instead of a blood pool.
The experiments were performed in a closed room (159.2 cm × 249.8 cm × 242.6 cm), where the
air was quiescent. Room temperature and relative humidity were measured with a Mannix PTH8708
temperature-humidity pen.
The experiments utilized ethically-sourced swine blood with heparin to prevent coagulation. The
blood was drawn less than 48 h prior to any experiment. The blood was placed on a rocker and was at
room temperature. Hematocrit was measured with a dedicated centrifugation device (STI, Hemata-
Stat-II).
The choice of swine blood can be explained as a compromise between safety and relevance to BPA
in a public university laboratory. Indeed, human blood is a biohazard, requiring extensive testing and
handling precautions to avoid risks of HIV (human immunodeﬁciency virus) and hepatitis B & C,
which can be deadly if untreated. Artiﬁcial blood is still in a development phase, and it is not clear if it
will ever be able to match all the complex - and still partly unknown [15]- characteristics of actual
blood [3]. Among animal blood, swine blood is the closest to human blood in terms of comparable
physical properties [16], such as hematocrit range, shear viscosity of whole blood and plasma, ery-
throcyte aggregation behavior. Since swine blood has not been associated with risks of HIV or
hepatitis B, it is a safer substitute to human blood. Thus, swine blood was drawn from healthy pigs
screened for zoonotic diseases at the Ames USDA facilities. Blood was stored refrigerated when not in
use and allowed to reach room temperature before use. Personal protection for biohazard including
coveralls, gloves, face shield, surgical mask, goggles, were used while producing spatters, and gloves
while manipulating dried spatters during e.g. scanning.
Most blood spatters were generated on a target made with ﬂat poster board sheets (UCreate,
Walmart Inc., 22 in × 28 in) taped together. The smooth side of the sheet was typically used. Few
experiments were made on the rougher side of the same sheets, and other on less expensive butcher
paper. Targets of large sizes (up to 136 × 110 cm) were assembled by taping together the back of two
or four poster board sheets with masking tape. An optical proﬁlometer Zygo Newview 6300 measured
the roughness of the target, with results reported in Table 1. Spreading correlations, which link drop
sizes, stain sizes and impact velocities together, have been characterized on those substrates
according to the methods in [10]. Note that Table 3 of [10] reporting values of roughness for a range of
substrates, has a typo for the roughness, mentioning [mm] instead of the correct magnitude in [μm].
The spatters were scanned at 600DPI (dots per inch) on a ﬂatbed scanner (Epson Expression
11000XL), which is slightly better than what has been obtained with high-end photography [4], and
allows to have a clear deﬁnition of the edges of most stains. The use of a scanner avoids issues of
parallax, which are often present on crime scene photographs. The spatters were scanned in a pie-
cewise manner, by cutting the tape joining the poster board sheets, because the maximum scanning
area of the scanner was A3 (297 × 420 mm), signiﬁcantly smaller than the largest target posters (1360
× 1100 mm). Poster board sheets were never cut in that process. Scans were assembled using image
processing software Adobe Photoshop®, and saved as high-quality jpg. A sticker was placed at the
center of each sheet, to allow precise assembly of the scans. Photoshop was used to remove marks
that were not stains, such as sticker, tape, or pencil marks.
