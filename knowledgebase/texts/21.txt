This work investigates the spreading dynamics of three candidate sol–gel solutions, of ranging viscosities,
surface tensions and densities, and compares them with water and two commercial blood substitute
products. Droplets were created with different sizes (10 to75 mL) and impact velocities (1.4 to 6.0 m/s) to
strike 176 gsm cardstock. Over 2200 droplets were created using the six different ﬂuids and their ﬁnal
dried stain diameter was measured. Droplet spread was plotted using the Scheller and Bousﬁeld
correlation and uses effective viscosity as a parameter for non-Newtonian ﬂuids. Comparing the results to
an expected whole human blood range validated the spread of the candidate FBS sol–gel material in
passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. These ﬁndings complement the practical application of the
material as a safe substitute for demonstrating droplet spread under controlled conditions on hard paper
surfaces.

1. Introduction
The Organization of Scientiﬁc Areas Committee’s (OSAC)
bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) subcommittee has recently
reported a call to determine the differences between fresh, whole
human blood and various blood substitutes for use in research,
training and case experimentation [1]. The subcommittee suggests
that further research can help with understanding the relationship
between the physical characteristics of blood and other ﬂuids and
the mechanisms that cause pattern formation [1]. This work
complements this idea by exploring the contributions of surface
tension, density and viscosity to droplet spread and passive drip
stain formation of various forensic blood substitutes (FBS).
Previously, our sol–gel formulation has demonstrated validity
in passive dripping simulation [2]. We can further evaluate the
utility of our materials by investigating the ﬂuid dynamics of
spread. We extend our previous data set [2] by creating more
droplets of various size and impact velocities. This helps to provide
a more comprehensive understanding of droplet spread in
practical crime scene reconstruction. We can then compare the
results of the sol–gel materials to the expected whole human blood
range in passive drip bloodstain pattern simulation. Validation of a
forensic blood substitute is an important component of its
implementation into research and training exercises. This is
particularly true with commonly encountered [3], well researched
[4] and extensively taught [5] bloodstains patterns associated with
bloodletting events.
Droplet impact and spreading dynamics have been heavily
explored in the literature [6]. Traditionally, spread has been
modeled in bloodstain pattern analysis, and other areas of ﬂuid
dynamics, using either the droplet’s Weber number and/or
Reynolds number [4,7]. A recent study suggests that the accuracy
of the model can be enhanced by blending terms from both the
capillary and viscous regimes of the ﬂuid [8]. Our work supports
this idea, and we use the Scheller and Bouseﬁeld relation [9] to
linearize the spreading ratios of six different ﬂuids. This work
extends previous work that uses the correlation as a platform to
test candidate FBS materials [10] as it can be used to express both
Newtonian and non-Newtonian spreading by using a ﬂuid’s high
shear, or effective viscosity [11]. In this paper we investigate the
spread of six ﬂuids, water, two commercial blood substitutes, and

three sol–gel materials used to develop what we describe as our
candidate FBS. This candidate FBS has been tested against whole
blood and validated using another passive dripping test [10]. The
focus of this work is to demonstrate the spreading dynamics of the
validated material in comparison to those observed for other
materials.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Test liquids
Six different ﬂuids were characterized in this experiment:
water, three sol–gel materials and two commercial products. The
sol–gels were created using an established protocol [2]. These
included the base formulation (GT), the base formulation that
undergoes a process for alcohol removal (LAGT), and the LAGT gel
with ﬁllers, which is our candidate FBS. The GT and LAGT
formulations had <1% weight by volume (w/v) food coloring, to
enhance visualization of the dried stains. Millipore water was used
with <1% w/v food coloring. Two commercial products were also
tested; one intended for use by forensic practitioners [12] and the
other for use in educational settings [13].
2.2. Physical property measurements
The surface tension of each ﬂuid was measured using the
Pendant_Drop plugin for ImageJ [14]. A 1 cc glass syringe was
cleaned with water and dried with acetone prior to droplet
formation. Scaled images of the fully developed droplets were
captured using a Nikon D3400 under ambient conditions prior to
droplet release. Fifty measurements were obtained per ﬂuid and
averaged.
Density was determined by measuring the mass of known
volumes of each material drawn in a 1 cc glass syringe with an
analytical balance. Ten measurements were obtained per ﬂuid and
averaged.
The viscosity of each ﬂuid was measured in triplicate at
25 C  0.05 C between shear rates 1 to 12,000 s1 using a TA AR
2000 rheometer. Viscosity was measured in ambient conditions as
each of the materials are considered stable and ready-to-use at
room temperature. Measurements were taken and averaged over
60 s for each of the shear rates analyzed. The high shear viscosity
was determined by averaging the ﬂuid’s viscosity at shear rates
greater than 100 s1.
Statistical test measures were applied to the density, surface
tension and viscosity measurements obtained for each of the six
tested ﬂuids. It is important to note that the whole human blood
values were not included in the testing, as the values were
obtained from the literature using different sources, where means
of the physical properties are reported rather than the raw data,
where variance in sample measurements are used and required for
statistical testing. A one-way ANOVA test was used to determine
whether 
there were 
any 
statistically signiﬁcant 
differences
between the means of the different ﬂuids’ densities, surface
tensions and high shear viscosities. A Tukey honestly signiﬁcant
different test was then used for post hoc testing for pairwise
analysis of each of the physical properties of the ﬂuids. Statistically
signiﬁcant differences were also conﬁrmed using a pairwise test
with a Bonferroni correction factor for multiple testing.
2.3. Stain deposition
Droplet volume was controlled using different syringe tips with
various diameters. Single droplets were formed at speciﬁc dripping
heights between 20–120 cm and allowed to fall perpendicular to
the target paper. Droplet volumes ranged from 10 to 75 mL and
impact velocities 1.4 to 6.0 ms1. White cardstock (65 lb/176 gsm)
was the target surface for stain deposition. Each piece had a circle
printed on it as an area that stains could be dropped within to avoid
any interference by the paper’s edges. 10 stains per dripping height
were created and allowed to dry prior to measurement. The
diameter of each stain was measured from scaled images of the
stains using ImageJ. Over 2200 stains were created and measured.
The droplet’s spread, DS/D0, was determined as the quotient
between the measured stain diameter, DS, and original droplet
volume D0.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical property measurements of test ﬂuids
Table 1 reports the average measured properties of the ﬂuids,
and includes an estimated whole human blood range that is taken
from a survey of the scientiﬁc literature on the scientiﬁc
literature. Combined, they form a wide range of 
testable
properties to model droplet spread, and therefore assess the
capabilities of the ﬂuids to act as forensic blood substitutes in
dripping simulation. Interestingly, the commercial substitutes
have signiﬁcantly different high shear viscosities and surface
tensions compared to whole human blood, and are in fact, more
similar to water. The LAGT and FBS have similar properties to
whole human blood, with a slightly lower surface tension and
higher density than required.
The one-way ANOVA testing determined that statistically
signiﬁcant differences exist between the means of each of the
tested ﬂuid’s densities, surface tensions and high shear viscosities
(p < 216 for each test). Using the post-hoc testing, only three
similarities in means were determined and were: the surface
tension between the LAGT and FBS (p = 0.250), the density between
water and Commercial 1 (p = 0.951) and the high shear viscosities
between water and Commercial 1 (p = 0.685). These results support
the idea that the sol–gels have physical properties that are much
different than water and the other commercial blood substitutes,
as well as demonstrate how the physical properties of Commercial
1 are similar to water. The rest of the pairwise comparisons were
determined to have statistically signiﬁcant differences between

the means of the pairs (p  3.110). The results of this ﬁnd primarily
suggest that each of these ﬂuids must be plotted independently
when mapping droplet spread. It also supports the idea of using
descriptors for ﬂuids being more “water-like” and “blood-like”.
Fig. 1 shows an example of a fully developed droplet of each
ﬂuid using the same 1 cc glass syringe. There is a visual difference
in droplet size and contour when they are fully developed at the
syringe tip. Since droplet size inﬂuences stain size, it is important,
then that consistency in droplet size is maintained when testing
candidate materials in passive dripping simulation.
The alcohol removal step when converting GT to LAGT is key to
increasing the surface tension of the base sol–gel material, while
not signiﬁcantly affecting its viscosity and density. The increase in
density from LAGT to FBS is a result of ﬁller addition.
3.2. Dried stain characteristics
Fig. 2 highlights the observed difference in the average
spreading ratio of the dried stains of each ﬂuid. This ﬁgures
shows the average spreading ratio of the stains created from
droplets of the same approximate size (36.9 mL  2.0 mL). Plotting
the spreading ratio, Ds/D0 accounts for minor volume differences
between the ﬂuids As expected, the water stains are much larger
than the commercial and sol–gel products, GT, LAGT and FBS.
3.3. Droplet spread
Using the Weber and Reynolds numbers individually to plot
ﬁnal stain diameter is not an effective way to understand
spreading in this case. Fig. 3 shows that most of the data falls
below the theoretically and experimentally depicted capillary and
viscous regimes commonly used to model spread [7,26–28]. This
has also been reported in a previous study of forensic relevance
[8].
If anything, these models are best suited for water, rather
than ﬂuids with a higher viscosity, like the commercial and
candidate ﬂuids. It is ﬁtting, then, that the ﬂuid spread is more
appropriately modeled using a combination of dimensionless
numbers.
The Scheller and Bouseﬁeld Correlation [9] using the An & Lee’s
concept of effective viscosity [11] shown in Fig. 4 is one example of
a method that linearizes the data (R2 = 0.71) and shows a clear
Fig. 1. Droplets that have formed prior to release from the tip of a 1 cc glass syringe for surface tension measurement. The average surface tension values for each of the ﬂuids
are given. The differences in opacity of the FBS and commercial products from the GT, LAGT and water are a result of the solid content of each ﬂuid.

difference in scalability of passive drip stains created by all of the
ﬂuids. The correlation uses a combination of a ﬂuid droplet’s
density, surface tension, viscosity, volume and impact velocity to
map its spread. The scaling factor (slope of the line of best ﬁt), 0.55,
is different than the 0.61 reported [11]; however, this is most likely
a result of surface constraint as stains were created on two slightly
different hard, porous surfaces [10]. Paper surfaces have complex
interactions at the ﬂuid-substrate interface, where absorbency can
conceivably limit spread.
Scalability is highlighted by the overlap in stain data between
ﬂuids. For example, a small water droplet can be made to look like a
larger stain created from larger droplets made from sol–gel and
vice versa. This speaks to the versatility in creating a wide variety of
formulations for FBS; however, practically this is ill-suited for

implementation into forensic training and reconstruction as
discussion of the scaling factors would require further and
unnecessary follow-up/instruction.
There is a clear difference between the LAGT and FBS solutions
compared to the other ﬂuids. In fact, the commercial products
share similar spreading characteristics to water. This is primarily
due to the products’ low viscosity. When applying the range of
experimental conditions (10 to 75 mL droplet volumes and impact
velocities 1.4 to 6.0 ms1) to the reported whole human blood
range, a theoretical range of spread is determined. This range,
shown in Fig. 4, was determined using an accommodating
approach, one that exploits the entire range of physical property
values reported in the literature. Again, some stains made by
water and the commercial standards fall outside of this range,
while the sol–gel solutions, particularly the LAGT and FBS, do not.
This is best demonstrated by Fig. 5, which uses the ﬂuids’
Ohnesorge numbers in relation to droplet spread. The vertical
spread in data at a speciﬁc Ohnesorge number is dictated by the
droplet’s impact velocity. Again, this plot demonstrates how the
LAGT and FBS solutions spread in a manner similar to whole
human blood range. Caution is recommended when using and
applying the commercial ﬂuids in dripping experiments under
the tested conditions.
The obvious extension of this work is to investigate splashing;
particularly in spine and scallop formation as well as the
generation of satellite stains from the parent stain.
3.4. Importance for validation prior to implementation in training
Establishing validation protocols are important for implement-
ing an artiﬁcial ﬂuid into bloodstain training and research
programs [29]. Using ﬂuids that can accurately represent the
mechanisms of bloodshed is important for training, particularly
where whole blood is not used. This holds true for both
quantitative and qualitative stain and pattern characteristics. It
is important to consider how well a ﬂuid mimics a well-researched
bloodstain pattern type. This is because there is little user-beneﬁt
in using a material with physical properties that are signiﬁcantly
different than whole blood as it could potentially provide a false
visualization of bloodstain pattern formation. This is particularly
important in training, as providing an accurate representation of a
scientiﬁc concept is important for a learner to understand the
theoretical and experimental core principles of pattern formation
[30]. This is why investigating the fundamental dynamics of
candidate FBS materials during pattern simulation is so important
for implementation into the industry.
4. Conclusion
This work extends the validation of the silicon sol–gel material
as a candidate FBS for simulated passive dripping under controlled
conditions on a paper substrate. Passive drip stains of six different
ﬂuids were created and their spread analyzed. Spread was modeled
using the Scheller and Bousﬁeld correlation, with an applied
effective high-shear viscosity for non-Newtonian ﬂuids. A theo-
retical range for whole human blood was determined and applied
to the data. This was used to show that droplet spread from the
LAGT and FBS solutions were more similar to blood, and the two
commercial products more similar to water. This work emphasizes
the need to characterize and thoroughly test FBS materials for use
in crime scene research and training.
