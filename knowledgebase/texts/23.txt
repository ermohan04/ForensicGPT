Predicting the Position of the Source of Blood
Stains for Angled Impacts
ABSTRACT: Droplets of pig’s blood were dropped onto paper at different angles to the horizontal to produce blood stains. Impact velocities var-
ied from 1.82 to 5.76 m⁄sec, drop size from 3.7 to 5.0 mm in diameter, and the surface sloped at angles between 22.7 and 90 to the horizontal.
From the data a single equation relating stain size to drop size and velocity for all impact angles was produced; ab = 111.74 (Re1 ⁄ 2We1 ⁄ 4)0.75DoDo +
0.00084 with R2 = 0.88, where a is the stain width, b the stain length, Re the Reynolds number, and We the Weber number. A second equation rela-
ted the number of spines, N, to drop size, velocity, and surface slope for all impact angles as N = 0.76 We0.5 sin3h with R2 = 0.9, where h is the
impact angle. Combining these equations the impact velocity can be determined and hence the position of the stain’s source.
KEYWORDS: forensic science, bloodstain pattern analysis, angled impact, spines, pig’s blood
The standard technique for determining the position of the source
of a blood stain at a crime scene is the ‘‘stringing technique’’ (1,2).
This technique uses the fact that the width to length ratio of a
blood stain is approximately related to its impact angle. Using the
calculated angle of impact, a straight line is drawn back from the
stain along the line of the impact angle. Where the lines from sev-
eral stains intersect is assumed to be the source of the stain.
However, this does not take into account the effect of gravity on
the flight path of the blood droplet. Assuming that the path of the
blood stain can be described by the equations for the movement of
a rigid object, i.e., neglecting factors such as air resistance and
oscillation of the blood droplet, then the equations needed to
include gravity in the flight path of the blood droplet are (3):
ui cos hi ¼ uf cos hf
ð1Þ
ui sin hi  gt ¼ uf sin hf
ð2Þ
xf ¼ xo þ ui cos hit
ð3Þ
yf ¼ yo þ ui sin hit  1
2 gt2
ð4Þ
where (xo,yo), are the coordinates of the source of the blood
drop; (xf, yf) the position of the centre of the blood stain; hi, the
angle to the horizontal at which the drop is launched; hf, the
angle to the horizontal at which the drop hits the ground (or
wall); ui, the initial velocity of the droplet; uf, the impact velo-
city of the droplet; t, time; and g, gravity. Eliminating the initial
angle of flight, the initial velocity, and time gives:
yo ¼ yf  tan hf xf  xo
ð
Þ  0:5g xf  xo
ð
Þ2
u2
f cos2 hf
ð5Þ
Now the final position of the stain is known, the horizontal
position of the source can be obtained by the stringing method
and this leaves two unknowns, the vertical position of the
source and the impact velocity when the drop hits the wall or
floor. If the latter can be determined from the stain shape and
size then the position of the source of the blood can be
obtained.
A large amount of work has been carried out looking at the ver-
tical impact of droplets onto different (dry) surfaces to study the
reverse problem, given a known drop size and impact velocity what
will the final shape of the liquid stain be for the cases when no
splashing occurs; for ink used in printing (4) and for water (5,6)
because of its use in irrigation (7,8) and settling dust on coal (9).
The authors found that the stain’s maximum size (10), final size
(11) [as droplets hit a surface they expand out due to momentum
and then contract back due to surface tension giving a final stain
size smaller than the maximum spread of the impacting droplet
(8)], number of spines (also termed fingers) (6,11), and any
rebound of the droplet (12) depended on the droplet’s impact velo-
city and size as well as a combination of surface tension, density,
viscosity, and contact area (11).
When studying blood stains at a crime scene the maximum
stain size or any rebound cannot be determined. This leaves the
stain’s size and number of spines from which to determine the
impact velocity. A variety of equations relating the stain’s size
and number of spines have been determined. Some are physics
based, looking at the stain size; the conservation of volume (4) or
energy (8) or the forces acting on the drop (9) or to predict the
number of spines; the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (5), or surface
tension (13). Other equations require complex computer modeling
(7,14,15). A survey of the papers prior to 1993 is given in Ref.
(11) and later work on the number of spines occurring is sum-
marized in Ref. (5).
In general, the equations developed in the above references were
found not to work when the authors of this paper applied them to
blood or water droplets. This may be due to the background of the
work. Many projects were set up to examine the spraying of liquids
onto surfaces (5) for use in spray painting or pesticide application,
resulting in low Reynolds and Weber numbers (16).
In 2005, Hulse-Smith et al. (17) showed that it is possible to
determine the impact velocity of a blood droplet landing vertically
from the number of spines around the blood stain and the stains

A theoretical parameter, ReI, proportional to the Weber and Rey-

has been used (16). The authors found correlations for experi-
mental data for a variety of liquids against Reynolds numbers
of up to 25,000 and Weber numbers of up to 4000 for ReI
against the number of spines and the ratio of stain size to drop
size. This paper is referenced in Ref. (5) but with the equation
now (mis)printed as

hereafter referred to as ReIM.
However, the above work only considered the vertical impact of
blood stains and many blood stains arrive at an angle to the sur-
face. Whilst there has been a large amount of work considering the
vertical impact of droplets as outlined above, there has been little
work on the angled impact of droplets, the exceptions were either
onto a heated surface (19) or a single case at a single angle of 45
to validate a complex computational fluid dynamics model of the
flow of a droplet but ignoring the generation of spines (20).
By looking at the angled impacts of blood droplets onto paper
this paper shows how the same equations can be used to determine
the impact velocity of droplets over a wide range of angles, for
which the vertical impact is simply a special case.
Experimental Technique
As in the work in Ref. (17), pig’s blood was used, which has
been shown to be a viable blood substitute (21). One liter of blood
was mixed with 100 mL of the anticoagulant 10% sodium citrate.
Blood was collected from the abattoir one morning and the blood
to be used that day was kept in a water bath at 37C and removed
only when it was to be used, ensuring that the experiments were
carried out at body temperature. The remaining blood was kept in
a fridge to be used the following day. All blood was discarded at
the end of the second day. Values for the density (1062 kg⁄m2),
viscosity (0.0048 N sec⁄m2), and surface tension (0.0056 N⁄m1)
for pig’s blood were taken from the literature (21).
The blood was dropped from pipettes clamped into position at
heights of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm above the impact surface,
resulting in impact velocities of 1.8–5.8 m⁄sec. Three different pip-
ette sizes were used, 1.52, 2.25, and 5 mm diameter, to obtain dif-
ferent sized droplets, resulting in measured drop diameters of 3.4–
5.0 mm. The pipette was changed every six drops to avoid clotting
of blood affecting the drop size formed. The droplet fell vertically
to impact onto a surface, the slope of which was altered to give
impact angles of 22.7, 43.5, 56.3, 61.6, 78.8, and 90 to the hori-
zontal. For the 22.7 impact only the 1.52 mm pipette was used
and for the small pipette at 90 to the horizontal, extra heights of
20, 40, 60, and 80 cm were included. The surface used was stand-
ard photocopying paper. Each combination of height, pipette size,
and surface slope was repeated six times.
The last 10 cm of the droplets fall was recorded using a Phan-
tom V7.1 camera (Vision Research Inc., Wayne, NJ) filming at
1000 frames⁄sec. The drop’s velocity and width were measured
using the camera’s image processing software, Phantom 7, camera
software version 605.2. Whilst the droplets were formed slowly
using the pipette to avoid imparting an initial velocity onto the
droplet, measuring the drop’s velocity using the camera meant that
if inadvertently an initial velocity was imparted onto the droplet, it
was taken into account in the results. For all stains the stain size
was measured and the number of spines around the entire stain
(360) was counted by hand. For each angle and height, the results
were averaged over the six replicates. The stain size and number of
spines were then plotted against a number of variables to obtain a
correlation coefficient.
Results
Figure 1 shows the effect of impact angle on the number of
spines obtained and the stain size and shape. As shown in previous
work (1), as the impact angle increases, i.e., becomes closer to a
vertical impact, the stain becomes shorter, until for a vertical
impact a circular stain is generated (Fig. 1a). What has not been
discussed before is that the number of spines also alters as the
impact angle alters. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the number of
spines increases as the impact angle increases. As the drop size or
impact velocity increase the stain size and number of spines also
increases for an angled impact, Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, as pre-
viously demonstrated in Ref. (17) for a vertical impact.
Vertical Impact
To compare the results against work by previous authors, at first
only vertical impacts were considered with the correlation coeffi-
cients, R2, given in Table 1 for stain size and Table 2 for number

of spines plotted against a number of parameters. When the stain
size is plotted against the Reynolds number or Weber number the
correlation is low as would be expected when plotting a dimen-
sional number against a nondimensional number.
The circular stain produced by a vertical impact can be para-
meterized by the stain’s diameter, DS. To nondimensionalize the
stain size for vertical impact, most work uses the ratio of the stain
diameter to the drop size, Ds⁄Do (17). This ratio is often known as
b (11). However, on a sloping surface the stain is oval in shape
(see for example Fig. 1c) and so the stain size, S, depends on both
the stain’s width (a) and length (b), and is given by S = pab⁄4. So
for the two-dimensional analysis, a new parameter has been devel-
oped during this work, a, given by:
a ¼ ab
D2

duced and therefore a = b this reduces to the form:
a ¼ ab

Hence to plot results equivalent to those in Ref. (17), here given

For this equation, as the velocity tends to zero the stain size
tends to a negative area. Physically the impact velocity is zero
when a drop is placed on the surface and allowed to collapse under
gravity to produce a stain of finite size. Hence c in Eq. (15) must
take a value greater than zero and the negative value in Eq. (16)
for the constant c is not physically realistic. As the drop size tends
to zero in Eq. (15) the stain size also tends to zero as would be
expected.
Although it is not physically realistic (as when the velocity tends
to zero the stain size tends to zero), to compare results to those in
Refs. (17,18), the equation for the Reynold’s number was forced to
pass through zero giving c = 0 in Eq. (15) as in Eq. (6) taken from
Ref. (17). This gave correlation coefficients of R2 = 0.81 and 0.83
for Re and Re0.5, respectively, with equations a = 0.00310 Re or
a = 0.200 Re0.5. The original for Re0.5 had a coefficient of 0.5 for
water droplets (18), but it was found necessary to alter this to
0.555 for the work on blood (17). This compares with the equival-
ent coefficient here of 0.22 = 0.4, suggesting differences in the
results.
Even better results are obtained with correlation coefficients of
R2 = 0.95 and 0.93 by plotting the stain size against ReIMDoDo and
ReDoDo. Mathematically, these variables give equations of the
form:
ab ¼ m1MD2
o þ c1
ð17Þ
where m1 and c1 are constants and M is a nondimensional num-
ber such as the Reynolds number or REIM. When the velocity
tends to zero the stain size tends to the value of c1; however, c1
is a constant and it would be expected that the stain size formed
when a droplet is placed on the surface (with zero velocity)
would vary with drop size. When the drop size tends to zero
then again the stain size tends to the value of c1, when clearly
it should tend to zero. When c1 is zero then as the drop size
tends to zero the stain size correctly tends to zero. However, as
the velocity tends to zero the stain size also tends to zero when
actually although it should become smaller it should tend
towards a size based on the drop size.
For the number of spines, significant correlations were found
(Table 2) for the Reynold’s number, the square root of the Weber
number, ReI and REIM. Once the equations are forced to pass
through zero, implying no spines when the velocity or drop size
tend to zero, the correlation coefficient for the Weber number
becomes insignificant but the other parameters still show significant
correlations. Compared to the results from Ref. (5,17), where the
number of spines from Eq. (7) was Cn = 0.955 and 1.11, respect-
ively, here the value for Cn was 0.63.
Angled Impact
When all the angles (from 22.7 to 90 to the horizontal) are
considered, the correlation coefficients on the right of Table 1 are
obtained for the stain size. To calculate the stain size using alpha,
the only significant correlation is against the Reynolds number
(Fig. 4) when R2 = 0.8. A significant correlation is also obtained
for the square root of the Reynolds number, but as in the vertical
impact case, the negative constant means that the stain’s size tends
to a negative area as the velocity tends to zero, nullifying this
equation.
As discussed in the section on vertical impact, an equation rela-
ting alpha to the impact velocity and drop size, when the line does
not pass through zero gives the best physical interpretation of the
data when the velocity or drop size tend to zero. However, better
correlations were found for the stains size against ReDD, ReIDoDo,
and ReIMDoDo. The best correlation was for ReIMDoDo (Fig. 5)
with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.88.
For the number of spines none of the parameters give a signifi-
cant correlation (Table 2). However, the graphs do not take into
account the angle of impact, which alters the stain’s shape. To take
this into consideration the graphs were replotted in the form:
y ¼ m  sinn h þ c
ð18Þ
where h is the impact angle and n is a constant, varied to give
the best fit. Correlation coefficients are given in Table 3.
These results include the data collected at 22.7 to the horizontal.
The number of spines tends toward a single spine as the impact
velocity and impact angle tend to zero. This means that at low
impact velocities and angles, it is impossible to distinguish between
stains by calculating the number of spines. However, for the experi-
ments carried out for the impact angle at 22.7 to the horizontal, it
was found that whilst droplets from 50 cm only formed one spine
(Fig. 6a) those at faster impacts (from 100 cm and above) formed
more than one spine (Fig. 6b). This suggests that whilst the correla-
tions are still valid at this angle, further work would be needed, for
example, looking at spine length, to consider smaller angles and
lower velocity impacts when only one spine is formed.
For the stain size the best results occur when the angle of
impact is neglected, i.e., n = 0 in Eq. (18). This implies that the
stain size is independent of the angle of impact. This is feasible
in that regardless of the impact angle the same amount of blood
is available and a change in stain size would only occur if signi-
ficant cast off occurs or the blood collects at one end of a long
stain or a stain is exceptionally thick. There was no clear sign of
these occurring.

As discussed above, physically, the best equation to use is that
for the Reynolds number given by:
a ¼ 0:0023Re þ 3:27
ð19Þ
as the equation makes physical sense as the velocity and drop
size tend to zero. Better fits are found using ReDoDo, REIDoDo,
and REIMDoDo but they do not give the correct result as the
velocity tends to zero. However, as long as the equation is only
used within the limits of the collected data then the other equa-
tions could be used, for example, the equation for REIMDoDo
with R2 = 0.88, compares with R2 = 0.70 for Eq. (19) gives
ab ¼ 111:74REIMDoDo þ 0:00084
ð20Þ
For the number of spines, the angle of impact has a clear effect
(see Fig. 1). Whilst there is no correlation when n is set to 0, for
n = 3 Reynolds number, Weber number, ReI and ReIM all give cor-
relations of better than 0.9. Example plots, for Re and We0.5 are
given in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. For the Weber number this
cubic dependence on the impact angle could be due to the variable
parameter DoVo
2, but for We0.5, Re, ReI, and ReIM the reason for
this cubic dependency of the angle is unclear.
A summary on the causes of spines is given in Ref. (5), out-
lining that at the moment, it is thought that the number of spines
depends on the surface tension of a liquid and not its viscosity.
Given the closeness of the correlation coefficients, this means
that from this data it is not possible to determine which equation
is best. Until more data varying the density, surface tension, vis-
cosity, and surface can be obtained it is recommended that the
equation using the square root of the Weber number is used.
Given that it would be expected that the number of spines
should tend to zero as the drop size or velocity tend to zero
then:

The coefficient in Eq. (21) is 0.76, this is lower than those in
Refs. (17) and (5), 0.955 and 1.11, respectively. The difference in
values may be due to the difference in surface used. The surface
affects the contact angle between the liquid and the surface and
hence the stain size (18). Another possible explanation is that, as
was observed in Ref. (17), counting spines is somewhat subject-
ive. The author’s experience with working with water and now
blood has shown that it is more important to be consistent than
to obtain the exact number of spines. As long as the counter is
consistent then the same relationships will occur, with slightly dif-
ferent coefficients, hence until the process can be automated a
researcher must obtain and apply their own equations to work in
the field.
Conclusions
The experimental work presented in this paper shows that it is
possible to use a single equation to take into account the impact
angle when calculating a blood stain’s size and number of
spines. Hence for a blood droplet’s impact on paper by measur-
ing the stains size and number of spines it is possible to deter-
mine the impact velocity and hence the position of the source of
the droplet.
The results differ from those of Hulse-Smith et al. (17), but dif-
ferent surfaces were used and as they point out the determination
of what is a spine is difficult to quantify. Results at Cranfield Uni-
versity have shown that as long as the person counting spines is
always consistent meaningful equations can be found and used.
The exact form of the equation to determine the number of spines
will require further work using different liquids to determine the
exact dependency of the number of spines.
Currently, work has only been carried out on paper and further
work will be needed to determine whether any relationships exist for
other surfaces and if they can also be incorporated into a single equa-
tion for all surfaces by taking account of the contact angle and⁄or
the surface roughness. Before use at crime scenes the work will then
have to be validated using blind trials. For crime scene work, it may
also be possible to set up equations that do not need the liquid’s den-
sity, viscosity, and surface tension, the values of which will have to
be taken from the literature, as they cannot be obtained from a dried
scene. However, this will make it more difficult to include effects
such as different surfaces or extend the work to other liquids found
at a crime scene and still have a single equation.
