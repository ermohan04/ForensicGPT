in bloodstain pattern analysis?

1. Introduction
Bloodstain pattern analysis has several applications in crime
scene reconstruction, informing on the sequence and timing of the
events, their mode of operation, and the location of blood sources.
The latter application is known as the determination of the region of
origin and involves the inspection of bloodstains and the backward
reconstruction of trajectories. Current methodologies for predicting
the origin of a bloodletting event rely on assuming that blood drops
travel in straight lines [1]. While simple, the technique involves
intrinsic inaccuracies since the effect of drag and gravity on drop
ﬂight are unaccounted. These inaccuracies become signiﬁcant as the
distance between the origin of the event and the spatter increases, or
in speciﬁc cases of downward projecting drops [2]. Several extensive
studies have also explored the uncertainty associated with an
arbitrary selection of stains or the values of impact angles [3–5].
To reconstruct the trajectories backward and account for drag
and gravity, knowledge of droplet size and impact velocity is
required [6]. These can be estimated from the morphology of the
bloodstains, by e.g. analyzing their size, volume and number of
spines [7–9]. In this regard, there is signiﬁcant literature proposing
correlations between stain diameters, droplet sizes, and impact
velocities [7,10,11]. A few studies have also demonstrated backward
reconstruction of trajectories [7,11], albeit without quantifying the
inﬂuence of speciﬁc target properties and blood hematocrit. Blood is
indeed a highly complex, shear-thinning, non-Newtonian ﬂuid,
whose ﬂow behavior depends on several factors such as: shear rate
(or the impact velocity), temperature, hematocrit and humidity
[12–14]. Hematocrit values in human blood of healthy individuals
vary between values of about 40 to 45% [1,15,16].
This manuscript highlights the effect of varying target conditions
in predicting the trajectories of blood drops. The experimental
analysis
presented
here
considers
dripping
drops
impacting
vertically on glass, cardboard, polycarbonate and aluminum targets.
The inﬂuence of target wettability and roughness is documented,
together with the inﬂuence of humidity, room temperature, blood
temperature and hematocrit. The study also describes a process to
measure the viscosity of blood and to estimate its variation with
hematocrit and temperature. The spreading characteristics of the
drop, in regards to surface wettability and roughness, are discussed
by generating individual correlations for each of the targets. Based
on the differences between correlations, the study quantiﬁes the
inaccuracies
in
the
simple
trajectory
reconstruction
task
of
identifying the drop release height when target-independent
correlations or population-average hematocrit levels are used
instead of values speciﬁc to the case at hand.

Trajectory reconstruction from inspection of bloodstain patterns is relevant to crime scene investigation.
While the inﬂuence of target properties on trajectory reconstruction has been often qualitatively
discussed, it has rarely been quantiﬁed. Similarly, a few impact studies measure the viscosity of the blood
used in impact experiments. In this work, the impact of blood drops is investigated on targets with a range
of surface roughness and surface material. The maximum spreading is characterized using a spreading
correlation, which relates the ratio of stain diameter to drop diameter with the non-dimensional numbers
Reynolds number and Ohnesorge number. The process for obtaining individual spreading correlations for
each of the target substrates and for measuring the viscosity of the respective blood samples is described
extensively. The error in estimating the drop release height, associated with using an impact correlation
unspeciﬁc to the target of interest, is estimated analytically and numerically using experimental data. A
similar analysis is done when the hematocrit of the blood is assumed rather than measured. Both
assumptions lead to signiﬁcant errors in estimating the release height of a blood droplet.

2. Experimental setup
2.1. Blood handling
For the blood droplet impact studies on solid surfaces, blood
from healthy swine is utilized, which is comparable to human blood
by its ability to assemble in rouleaux at low shear rates [17,18]. The
blood used in this study is purchased from the National Animal
Disease Center, in Ames, IA. The anticoagulant used is 1% heparin.
Before use, the blood is placed on a rocker (Labquake, Thermo
Scientiﬁc) until it reaches room temperature. The hematocrit of the
blood is measured through centrifugation (STI, HemataStat-II) at
1548–2312 g for 60  3 s, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The
temperature of blood, room temperature and relative humidity are
also documented prior to experimentation. No blood samples older
than three days were used in the experiments.
2.2. Blood rheometry
Before each blood droplet impact experiment, blood viscosity is
measured at the documented temperature and at different shear
rates (seven measurements are taken with shear rates ranging
from 10 to 2500 s1), using the capillary viscometer setup shown
in Fig. 1. The setup comprises a syringe pump (KD Scientiﬁc,
780230) which pumps blood into a hard polycarbonate capillary
tube (FEP, ID 0.521 mm, length 1.575 m), with a controlled ﬂow
rate between 0.01 and 2 mL/min. These values of ﬂow rates
correspond to a Reynolds number Re < 600, thereby assuring a
laminar ﬂow. A differential pressure sensor (Omega DPG 110, with
a range of 1 to 7 bar and accuracy < 0.5%) is employed to measure
the pressure drop DP along the tube at different ﬂow rates Q. The
entry length (Le) for Newtonian ﬂows is theoretically calculated as
Le/D = 0.06Re, where D is the internal diameter of the tubing
[19]. For Re = 600, the entry length for a Newtonian ﬂow comes out
to be 18 mm, and that for a shear-thinning ﬂuid is of comparable
length [20]. In the experimental setup, an entry length of 12 cm is
provided to ensure that the velocity proﬁle is fully developed
before reaching the pressure sensor.
The Ostwald-de Waele power-law equation is used to describe
the shear-thinning behavior
t ¼ K ˙gn;
(1)
with ˙g is the shear rate, t, the shear stress, and K and n the
respective
ﬂow
consistency
and
non-Newtonian
power-law
exponent. Then, the Rabinowitsch–Mooney (RM) equation is
employed to determine the non-Newtonian shear rate [21,22]:
˙g ¼  Q

(2)
Above, R is the hydraulic radius of the tubing and d represents
the derivative. The non-Newtonian power law exponent (n) is
expressed as
n ¼ dlogDP
dlogQ
(3)
Equation (1) is coupled with the wall shear stress (tw) given by:
tw ¼ DDP
4L
¼ K ˙gn;
(4)
to calculate the coefﬁcient K. The relative uncertainty (SD = 4%) on
the viscosity measurements with the capillary viscometer is
mostly due to the uncertainty on the temperature and on the
pressure measurement.
The viscosity measurement reaches a plateau (4.1  0.05 mPa,s)
above a shear rate of approximately 580 s1. While the chosen
mathematical correlation matches well with the data points in
general, there is a slight mismatch where the measured viscosity
reaches a plateau due to the inherent mathematical shape of the curve
ﬁt. Expressions for the viscosity accounting for the dependency on
shear rate, temperature (T) [6] and hematocrit (H) can be obtained as
follows. First, the power law curves, equation (5), of six blood samples
(labeled A to F), measured at different temperature and hematocrit
levels, are tabulated in Table 1.
Then, the viscosity at a given shear rate is expressed as a linear
function of T and H, as in
mð ˙gÞ ¼ a0 þ a1T þ a2H;

Although the viscosity typically varies exponentially with
temperature [19], the small temperature range (15–30 8C) in the
present experiments allows a linear assumption between the
viscosity and temperature[13].
A question arises as to which shear rate to use for evaluating the
viscosity. In drop impacts with relevance to bloodstain pattern
analysis, the shear rate is on the order of the impact velocity
divided by the drop diameter [7]. Taking a typical case of a 1 mm
droplet travelling at 2 m/s or faster, this corresponds to a shear rate
of 2000 s1 or larger. Also, as observed in Fig. 2, the viscosity attains
a plateau above a shear rate of approximately 580 s1. This plateau,
physically corresponds to the situation where shear is so high that

blood cells no longer interact so that the blood assumes Newtonian
behavior. Consequently, the blood viscosity value used here is at a
shear rate of 2000 s1. As a function of T (in 8C) and H (in %), it
corresponds to the following correlation

2.3. Drop impacts experiments
As described in Table 2, the drop impact experiments are
conducted on glass, cardstock (Colorbok, textured white cardstock),
polycarbonate and aluminum surfaces, which represent a range of
non-absorbing surfaces. Several values of surface roughness for
polycarbonate and aluminum surfaces are obtained after grinding
with sand paper and subsequent rinsing with isopropanol and
deionized water. Then, to dry the targets, the aluminum surfaces are
wiped with clean tissue, while only compressed air is used for
polycarbonate to prevent the formation of static charge on the
surface.
Surface roughness of the targets is measured using a 3D
microscope (Hirox, Digital Microscope, KH-8700). The static
contact angle of the blood drops, on the targets, is measured
using ImageJ software [24]. A syringe pump (KD Scientiﬁc,
KDS230) is used to create blood droplets, through FEP tubing
and a 27 gauge blunt needle (corresponding to an average droplet
diameter of 2.47 mm, and a volume of 7.89 mL), as shown in
Fig. 3. Within 70% population interval, the uncertainty on the
measured droplet diameter is 3.1%, and 6.2% for impact velocity.
Blood is a complex ﬂuid and the following handling precautions
have been useful to reduce experimental uncertainties. The blood
is continuously pumped (at 0.1 ml/min), without stopping, to
prevent its drying at the needle outlet; drying of blood at the
needle outlet has been observed to modify drop diameter over
time. Correspondingly, a droplet is generated every 5 s. A small
container was placed under the needle to collect redundant
droplets generated between each trial of experiment. Droplet
impact velocity is altered by changing the droplet release height (5,
10, 20, 60 and 150 cm). At each height, the needle is replaced to
ensure consistent nozzle condition. The targets are blown with
compressed air just before the start of the experiments to remove
any residual dust particles. Series of 10 blood stains are created on
each surface, at each height, to ensure repeatability of results. A
high speed camera (Redlake MotionXtra HG-100 K) is used to
record the droplet impact, while the dripping rate is kept constant.
3. Results and discussion
The representative sequence of events during droplet impact
and spreading on different targets is shown in Fig. 4. When the
droplet impacts normally on the surface, its inertia drives the liquid
radially outwards, and this expansion is opposed by viscous
dissipation in the blood and by surface tension at the blood–air
interface. At t = 2 ms, the droplet stretches the blood into a thin
layer called lamella, surrounded by a peripheral thicker ring called
the rim. About 3 ms after the impact, as the inertial forces weaken,
the droplet reaches a maximum spreading, whereafter capillary and
viscous forces dominate. The liquid in the rim is brought back by
surface tension toward the vertical axis of symmetry. This recoiling
phase
occurs
for
3 ms < t < 20 ms,
and
corresponds
to
the
dissipation of the inertial forces by viscous forces. That phase
occurs with contact line pinned to the target[7,11,25], except on
glass as observed in Fig. 4. After the instance of maximum spreading
(image (iv) in Fig. 4), the contact line remains pinned for the
aluminium, cardstock and polycarbonate targets, while the contact
line on the glass target spreads further: this is attributed to the

signiﬁcantly higher wettability of the glass target, due to low
wetting angle and roughness, compared to the other targets. A
glossary for the speciﬁc ﬂuid dynamics terms used in this paragraph
is available in Tables 2 and 4b of review [6].
To formulate correlations for a speciﬁc target, droplet diameter,
impact velocity and spreading factor are measured from the
sequence of images. Droplet diameter is determined using equation
(8), which accounts for drop extensional oscillation following
detachment from the needle [26].

impact velocity and diameter, we ﬁt correlations [27] of the

Here, We is the Weber number (We ¼ rVid2

The Ohnesorge number can be understood as a comparison
between the kinetic energy of impact with the resistant work of the
viscous forces and the surface tension. As mentioned previously, as
the time scale of the spreading process is extremely small, droplet
spreading is associated with high shear rates. Consequently, it is
acceptable to employ the viscosity of blood at high shear rates[7];
here, the viscosity value at 2000 s1 is used, as mentioned in
Table 3. The corresponding correlations for the different targets are
plotted in Fig. 5 and tabulated in Table 3.
Inspection of Fig. 5 reveals ﬁrst how much larger the spreading
is on the glass target. At low impact velocities, the spread factor on
glass is on average 25% larger than on the other targets. This might
be due to enhanced wetting on the glass, which has a signiﬁcantly
lower contact angle than other targets, as shown in tabulated in
Table 3. As the Ohnesorge number increases, i.e. as the ratio of
impact energy versus the work of resistance forces increases, the
spread factor on the glass target becomes comparable with that on
other targets, owing to the decreased inﬂuence of wetting forces on
spreading[10].
Fig. 5 also demonstrates how spreading is inﬂuenced by the
roughness, for a given surface. The spreading factor for the
roughened aluminum and polycarbonate targets are lower than for
their respective unaltered counterparts. These observations are
coherent with the observations in Patil et al. [28] and Hulse-Smith
et al. [7], where an increase in the surface roughness reduces
spreading upon drop impact. The associated formation of spines
observed in [7] is attributed to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
which is encountered when a liquid-air interface is subjected to a
sudden acceleration[7,29]. One question that arises is if the
spreading factor as calculated by equation (10) remains constant
between a few seconds after impact and the hours or days that
separate a crime from a thorough bloodstain pattern analysis.
Indeed, Brutin et al. [14] recently reported a slow spreading of
sessile blood drops on glass due to evaporation, until equilibrium is
reached. However, such a spreading is not observed in our
experiments of impacting drops. For glass, the dried stain diameter
measured 24 h after impact is approximately 2% smaller than the
diameter of the blood drop after 20 ms of impact. A similar
variation is observed for the other targets, where the dried stain
diameter is approximately 2–3% smaller than the blood drop
diameter after 20 ms of impact. This difference in spreading
behavior, between the observation of Brutin’s group, who used
sessile drops spreading slowly, and our experiments, can be
attributed to the enhanced inertial spreading of the drop on impact
in our study, where the inertia of the impacting drops completely
overpowers the surface forces and causes the drops to reach a
maximum spread within just 20 ms after impact. The spreading
induced by evaporative ﬂux observed in [14] is effective on a much
larger time scale (in the order of 1 s), hence, its effects are not
observed.
Based on the data in Fig. 5, a question of high relevance to
forensic arises as follows. For the purpose of trajectory reconstruction
from inspection of stains, can we use a single spreading correlation
independently of the target material and conditions? Let us ﬁrst
quantify the uncertainty on trajectory reconstruction induced by
using a one-size ﬁt all correlation, versus correlations speciﬁc to a
given target. A way to study these effects is by analytical inspection
of equation (11). For a given correlation (i.e., known values of a and
b) and a known b (from known stain size and drop volume), the
height from which the drop is released can be predicted using
equation (11). Assuming that drag does not affect the droplet
trajectory, the impact velocity of the drop can be given as:
Vi ¼

Taking the values for a and b for aluminum mirror as the base,
and b = 3, a 10% change in a (keeping b constant) leads to about a
51% change in h, whilst, a 10% change in b (keeping a constant)
leads to about a 43% change in h. Conversely, to ensure that a
change in h does not exceed 10% (i.e. Dh/h < 10%), the maximum
change in a and b should not exceed approximately 2 and 3%,
respectively. Relating these observations to the correlations for
different targets in Table 3, the variations in a (between 2 and
116%) and b (between 1.5 and 33%) exceed the above calculated
values, thereby indicating that a single correlation will signiﬁcant-
ly impact the prediction of a drop release height.
The effects of this ﬁnding can be shown from the current set of
experiments, in Fig. 6. Here, we use the measured spread factor b
from drop impact experiments on the aluminum mirror target
(from all drop release heights), and calculate the drop release height
using the spreading correlations of Table 3 speciﬁc to each of the
targets. For the case with gravity and without drag, equation (16) is
used to reconstruct the trajectory. For the case with gravity and
drag, the differential equations of motion in [6] are numerically
integrated. Hence, the height ratio HR compares the calculated
heights using correlations of the individual targets (x-axis), to the
experimental drop release height on the aluminum mirror. It is
important to mention here that the data in Fig. 6 corresponds to all
the drop release heights used in the experiments (i.e. 5, 10, 20,
60 and 150 cm). Fig. 6 clearly shows a marked difference in height
predictions from the respective correlations; the variation in the
average height values are tabulated in Table 4. For example,
estimating the height of release of stains found on an aluminim
mirror target using correlations obtained on glass would underes-
timate the release height by about 50%, while using correlations for
rough polycarbonate would overestimate the height by about 50%.
A related question of interest is the inﬂuence of the assumed
hematocrit level on the backward reconstruction of trajectories.
This corresponds to a crime scene reconstruction where a standard
hematocrit level, say 44%, would be used to estimate the height of a
released drop, instead of measuring the hematocrit of the individual
to whom the blood belongs. For the case where gravity is considered
and drag neglected, the resulting uncertainty on the prediction of
the release height of a dripping drop can be estimated again by
analyzing how equation (16) depends on the hematocrit. First, the
viscosity m of the blood depends on the blood hematocrit, as per
equation (5). Second, the drop impact diameter di is not known on a
crime scene, contrary to the laboratory experiments here where it
can be measured from high-speed videos. In a crime scene situation,
it has been proposed to estimate di by e.g. by measuring the volume
Vs of solid material remaining in the stain [6], which is linearly
proportional to the drop volume and the hematocrit [9], so that
Vd = aVs/H, where a is a proportionality coefﬁcient determined
experimentally. For the present experiments, where average drop
volume of 7.89 mL and the average value of H = 44% is known, we
have aVS = 3.47 mL. As a result, the estimated impacting drop
diameter (di), for an unknown value of H can be obtained as:

Therefore, using standard values of hematocrit in trajectory
reconstruction introduces two systematic errors, one on the blood
viscosity and the other on the estimated impact diameter. An
example of the systematic error due to the use of standard values of
hematocrit for the estimation of the dripping drop release height is
shown in Fig. 7 for the situation when a dripping drop impacts an
aluminum mirror surface (i.e. a = 0.4285 and b = 0.1934), with
typical spreading b = 3 and 3.9. The droplet release height was
estimated with and without considering the drag force acting on
the droplet, as was done for Fig. 6. For a typical hematocrit value of
44%, the estimated droplet release heights are 26.0 cm without
drag and 28.1 cm with drag for the spreading factor b = 3. For the
spreading factor b = 3.9, the estimated droplet release heights are
100.8 cm without drag and 129.8 cm with drag.
The range of height over which the above graph is plotted
corresponds to the typical values of hematocrit found in humans. It
is seen that within this range, and for this speciﬁc trajectory
reconstruction task, a difference of 10% between the hematocrit
used to develop the correlations, and that relevant to the crime
scene (for instance 40% vs. 50%) leads to errors larger than 30% in the

the droplet release heights used in the experiment (i.e. 5, 10, 20, 60 and 150 cm) were taken as the reference height to calculate HR. The drop release heights were calculated
with and without considering drag force on the droplet.

drop release height calculations (23.0 cm vs. 30.7 cm for b = 3,
89.2 cm vs. 119.1 cm for b = 3.9 for calculations without drag). For
trajectory reconstructions involving gravity and drag, the error is
between 30 and 50% (24.7 cm vs. 33.7 cm for =3; 110.2 cm vs.
164.6 cm for b = 3.9). Thus, the problem of reconstructing trajecto-
ries by inspection of individual drops seems very sensitive to the
correct choice of the spreading correlation and to the correct
knowledge of the hematocrit.
4. Conclusion
The impact of blood drops on targets with different materials and
roughnesses was investigated, detailing a methodology for measur-
ing
the
viscosity of blood
at
relevant high shear
rates
of
2000 s1. Care was taken to ensure consistent blood ﬂow conditions
during experimentation, whilst the blood rheometry procedure
allowed the use of appropriate values of blood viscosity for the blood
sample used for experimentation, incorporating the effect of
temperature and hematocrit. Individual correlations, relating stain
size (through spreading factor b) and velocity of impact (through
Re2Oh), were developed for each of the targets, with an aim to
minimize the error in calculation of drop release height. Conse-
quently, it was demonstrated, both analytically and numerically,
that reconstructing the height of release of an individual drop by
stain inspection using correlations obtained with a different target
than the target of interest can lead to signiﬁcant errors, as large as
50% of the drop release height. A similar analysis showed that a
difference of 10% between the hematocrit used to develop the
correlations, and that relevant to the crime scene (for instance 40%
vs. 50%), induced errors between 30 and 50% in the drop release
height. The systematic errors induced by misestimating the
hematocrit or by using spreading correlations not speciﬁc to the
target of interest were found larger when drag was included in the
calculations, besides gravity. While this level of uncertainty is
probably acceptable in most court cases, it is nonetheless important
that BPA analysts are aware of the magnitude of the uncertainty.
This is especially important in relation with the 2009 study of the US
National Academies of Science and Engineering, which mentioned
that ‘‘the uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis
are enormous’’ [30]. As a result, we suggest that for an accurate
trajectory reconstruction of blood drops, it is advisable to generate
correlations individual to the speciﬁc surface and blood, if the
surface characteristics and hematocrit of the blood speciﬁc to the
crime scene is available. Employing generalized correlations or
average
hematocrit
levels
can
lead
to
signiﬁcant
errors
in
determining the region of origin of the blood spatter.
