An improved automated bloodstain pattern analysis method has been developed and validated, which utilises 
computer vision techniques to identify bloodstains on a plain background within a digital image. The method 
generates metrics relating to the individual stains as well as the overall pattern, including bloodstain pattern 
specific metrics such as the gamma angle, circularity, solidity, area of convergence, stain density and pattern 
linearity. This method provides an objective approach to the analysis of bloodstains and bloodstain patterns and 
can generate a wealth of quantitative data that is currently not obtainable using manual techniques or other 
image-based programs currently utilised in the discipline. This method will be useful to analysts and researchers 
investigating the application of quantitative methods to bloodstain pattern analysis.
1. Introduction
Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is a discipline of forensic science 
that is concerned with the study of the size, shape and distribution of 
bloodstains deposited onto surfaces at bloodletting events, particularly 
crime scenes. With knowledge of the underlying principles of fluid 
mechanics, the physical characteristics of the stains can be analysed and 
used to assist with the reconstruction of the events that led to the 
bloodshed [1–3]. One of the key tasks in BPA is the classification of 
spatter patterns. Spatter patterns are groups of small circular and 
elliptical shaped bloodstains that have been formed as the result of some 
external force being applied to a source of liquid blood [4]. The current 
terminology of the different classes of spatter patterns in BPA relate to 
the mechanism of the force that caused them. Common types of spatter 
patterns present at crime scenes include impact (caused by an object 
striking liquid blood), swing cast-off (caused by blood released from a 
bloodstained object due to its swinging motion), and expirated (caused 
by the generation of droplets due to the force involved with the expul­
sion of blood from the mouth, nose or lungs) [4]. The application of 
these forces on the liquid blood results in its breakup into smaller 
droplets that travel through the air away from the blood source. When 
these predominately spherical droplets land onto nearby surfaces they 
collapse and spread on the target forming circular and elliptical shaped 
bloodstains.
BPA can be a valuable tool in investigations; however, the subjec­
tivity of the discipline has been criticised [5,6] and disagreements be­
tween trained analysts have been documented in some high-profile cases 
[7,8]. A lack of empirical data and scientific foundations was cited as 
areas needed for improvement [5]. These criticisms have raised doubt 
over the reliability of the evidence that is often delivered in courtrooms. 
In response, reliability and black box studies have been undertaken to 
investigate the accuracy and reliability of bloodstain pattern classifica­
tion. These studies have shown that some spatter patterns can have high 
error rates for classification [9–11]. This is not unsurprising as the me­
chanical process involved in the formation of spatter stains is the same 
regardless of the initial force applied. As a result, there are overlapping 
characteristics between different types of spatter patterns (for example, 
the range of stain sizes in a pattern) which can lead to ambiguity or 
misclassification. Studies have also shown some analysts are not always 
consistent with their classifications, classifying the same pattern 
differently when unknowingly presented with it a second time [12]. The 
inference being that there is a subjective approach to the classification 
process. There have been calls for more systematic guidelines within the 
discipline to assist with the classification task, but currently there is still 
no agreed criteria about what features are required to make a classifi­
cation and the decision is left to the analyst based on their training, 
experience and level of confidence.
To reduce the subjectivity, quantitative methods have been

investigated to assist with BPA. Earlier research has applied image 
processing techniques to the analysis of digital images of bloodstains to 
automatically fit ellipses to the bloodstain shape and determine the 
impact angle and orientation angle from the minor and major axes. 
However, the described methodologies were applied to images of single 
bloodstains [13–15] or the procedure required input from the analyst to 
select the appropriate stains within a pattern [16,17]. More recently, 
researchers have utilised the quantitative techniques of Matlab [18–20]
or ImageJ [21–23] to the analysis of digital images of bloodstain pat­
terns. While both methods can easily extract the number of stains and 
give a measurement regarding their size, other BPA specific metrics are 
not available such as the directionality of the stain (represented 
numerically as the gamma angle), and the impact angle.
1.1. Gamma and impact angles
When a droplet lands on a target at an angle, the resultant stain is 
elliptical with the major (long) axis in alignment with the direction of 
travel. Furthermore, as the blood droplet collapses and spreads across 
the target a volume of the liquid can form a small wave that follows the 
direction of travel of the droplet. This wave can spill over from the 
contact line (the edge of the blood in the main parent stain) resulting in 
thin protrusions extending from the end of the parent elliptical stain 
[24]. Depending on the angle, droplet size and surface features, the 
protrusions can be single (referred as a tail), multiple (referred to as 
spines) and/or fully detach from the parent stain (see Fig. 1). The 
presence of these tails or spines on one side of an elliptical stain is 
considered a reliable indicator for the direction of travel along the major 
axis, and by combining the orientation angle with the direction, the 
gamma angle can be determined. For example, a stain on a 45-degree 
angle with a right direction will have a gamma angle of 45 degrees. 
However, if the same stain’s directionality was left the gamma angle 
would be 225 degrees (see Fig. 2) [1].
Whilst the gamma angle can give information about the general di­
rection a blood drop was travelling, the trajectory of the droplet can be 
estimated by including information on the angle the droplet impacted a 
target surface. It has been previously demonstrated that there is a rela­
tionship between the width to length ratio of an elliptical stain and the 
angle of impact (α) of the droplet to the target. Perpendicular impacts 
result in circular stains, more oblique angles result in more elongated 
elliptical stains. This relationship is shown in Eq.1 [25]. 
α = arcsin Width
Length
(1) 
An accurate impact angle estimation relies on an accurate width and 
length measurement. One of the challenges faced by BPA analysts is 
accurately measuring the elliptical shape of the parent stain when the 
tails and spines lengthen the final stain. Analysts are trained to ignore 
these protrusions when estimating the length of the ellipse [26]. By 
combining the estimated impact and gamma angles a straight-line tra­
jectory of the droplet can be determined. It is noted that the other 
influencing forces such as gravity and drag are ignored during this 
estimation.
Determining these angles for various stains can assist with grouping 
stains together as part of the same pattern/event and also can be used to 
limit the positions of the blood source within a geometric space and 
therefore assist with reconstruction of events at a scene. Most analysis at 
crime scenes is still undertaken manually and each spatter pattern can 
contain hundreds to thousands of stains. So, whilst the gamma and 
impact angles are considered important features there is currently 
neither the time nor the resources to collect data on every individual 
stain.
In 2017 image processing techniques were applied to develop a 
methodology that can automatically extract bloodstain pattern features 
from digital images [18]. Using Matlab R2015B the digital image of an 
impact pattern was imported, the background subtracted, and the ob­
jects of interest (stains) segmented using the Triangle thresholding al­
gorithm. To overcome the challenge of fitting accurate ellipses to stains 
with spines, the researchers applied erosion and dilation morphological 
operations to remove small protrusions and background noise. Stains 
greater than 10 pixels in both the original binarised image and the 
eroded/dilated image were then mapped, linked and relevant mea­
surements computed using Matlab regionprops [18]. In this research the 
direction of the stains was determined by locating the centroid of the 
ellipse from the eroded/dilated image within the bounding box of the 
original stain. This along with the orientation angle was used to calcu­
late the gamma angle. Other BPA specific features were also computed. 
These included shape features of the individual stains (tail to body ratio, 
width to length ratio, area of stain to area of convex hull ratio (regularity 
measure), ratio of perimeter of inscribed circle to perimeter of stain, 
stain size and stain intensity. Five pattern features were also calculated: 
overall directionality, convergence, linearity, circularity of pattern, 
stain density.
Subsequently this methodology was applied to a limited number of 
laboratory generated impact and cast-off patterns [27] and the results 
analysed. A combination of five of the above-described features were 
found to be optimal for distinguishing between these two classes of 
patterns. Although demonstrating a promising approach to the appli­
cation of an automated system to the analysis of spatter patterns, Matlab 
licences are expensive and not all researchers and BPA analysts have 
easy access to this platform. Furthermore, the fixed thresholding values 
did not work well when the methodology was applied to further labo­
ratory generated spatter patterns created in our research facilities and 
the system was slow to analyse patterns with thousands of stains [28].
We present an Automated Bloodstain Pattern Analysis method 
(ABPA method) that improves on the previous methodology described 
[18], increasing the detection of the small stains present in the patterns, 
and computing more suitable BPA specific metrics that have been 
developed based on the results of prior research [27,28] and on an un­
derstanding of the fluid mechanics underpinning the formation of blood 
spatter patterns. This application has been implemented in Python, 
importing modules including numpy, matplotlib, and Open CV for easy 
implementation of image segmentation and analysis. Python has the 
benefit of being a free open-source language that is readily available to 
researchers, academics and analysts, making the method more acces­
sible than Matlab.

were used. The patterns were laboratory generated using porcine blood, 
and a food safe blood substitute (42.5 % w/v liquid honey, 20 % w/v 
water-based dye, 10 % w/v pasteurised egg white, and 27.5 % w/v de- 
ionised water). Surface tension and viscosity were not measured. The 
patterns were created on paper targets, with a wide range of variables 
including volume of blood, variations of force applied and various ob­
jects or expirated mechanisms used. The resulting patterns ranged from 
singular stains to up to thousands of stains depending on the variables 
used. A Canon EOS 5Ds with a 24–70 mm lens was used to photograph 
the bloodstain patterns. For each photo the same settings were used: 
8688 ×4888 pixels resolution, 70 mm zoom, diaphragm opening of f5.6, 
shutter speed of 1/125 s and automatic ISO and focus, resulting in all 
images having a resolution of 7.9 pixels per mm. Multiple images were 
taken for each pattern to capture all the stains and these were stitched 
together using photo stitching software (PTGui version V10.0.17). In 
order to stitch these images together, pins or stickers were placed in the 
images to act as reference points. Therefore, in addition to the blood­
stains, most images had markers as well as rulers around the edge to 
show the scale.
3. Development of automated bloodstain pattern analysis 
method
The methodology presented in this paper takes a digital image of a 
bloodstain pattern, identifies the individual bloodstains, calculates 
metrics for each individual stain and metrics for the overall pattern. 
Improvements to both the segmentation of the stains and the methods 
for calculating bloodstain metrics have been implemented.
3.1. Cropping of images
To segment the bloodstains, it was assumed that the image had a 
lighter background to the bloodstains and no other objects were in the 
image apart from circular stickers used for stitching. This is a reasonable 
assumption for research purposes. Any rulers present in the images were 
therefore required to be removed. An automatic cropping function 
previously developed [28], was incorporated into the methodology to 
achieve this. However, this method assumes there are four rulers, on all 
four edges, so for images with less than four rulers the rulers were 
required to be manually cropped.
3.2. Stain segmentation
As part of the cropping process the image was first blurred with a 
Gaussian blur and converted to grey scale. A novel approach to the 
detection of the bloodstains in the images was then developed. Rather 
than using Triangle or Otsu thresholding which have been used in prior 
research [14,18,28] and which rely on the entire image having a 
consistent histogram, the grey scale image was converted to binary with 
adaptive thresholding. Adaptive thresholding calculates the threshold 
value for smaller regions of the image determined by a block size which 
leads to different threshold values for regions which have changes in 
lighting, reducing the effect of shadows and noise [29]. The adaptive 
thresholding method applied was based on the Gaussian mean value of a 
block in the image then a constant offset parameter was applied. The 
block size was set at 99 pixels for all images. The binary image was 
produced by setting all pixels with values below the threshold to black 
and all pixels with values above the threshold to white resulting in white 
stains on a black background.
An opening morphology operation (erosion followed by dilation) to 
reduce noise and remove some protrusions that are not significant, was 
then performed on the binary image as described in [28]. Circular 
stickers added to assist with image stitching were removed by incor­
porating the Hough circle transform algorithm [30] as detailed in [28]. 
Finally, each stain or polygon was found by finding the contours of the 
image using the Suki border algorithm [31]. Stain less than 5 pixels were 
not counted due to the uncertainty of them being true stains versus 
background noise.
3.3. Bloodstain metrics
Ten different outputs were developed and computed for each indi­
vidual stain in the image. These, along with the four developed pattern 
metrics are summarised in Table 1.
Each stain was designated an identification number and the X and Y 
positions for the centroid were computed. The area of the bloodstain was 
simply a count of all the pixels in the stain boundary. The inputted scale 
value (pixels per mm) was used to covert this value to area in mm2. The 
pixel count was retained as this was found to be a useful metric when 
sorting and applying thresholds to the outputted data. The intensity was 
measured by the normalised average grey scale value of the pixels in the 
stain and was used as a measure of lightness for the stains. The solidity (a 
measure of boundary smoothness or regularity) of the stains was 
determined by the ratio of the area of the stain to the area of the convex 
hull of the stain. Smooth edged stains with no protrusions will have a 
solidity value close to 1.
3.4. Ellipse fitting
The remaining five bloodstain metrics required the fitting of an el­
lipse for calculation. As discussed, any tails or protrusions will falsely 
elongate the length of any fitted ellipse, and therefore these need to be 
removed prior to any ellipse fitting. Rather than using an erosion and 
dilation operation that has been used in prior research, a novel solution 
to the task of removing the tails was developed. This involved identi­
fying the concave points along the stain boundary, then starting from the 
furthest point away from the centroid, the algorithm stepped around the 
stain in both directions measuring the distance between the two points. 
When the ratio of this distance to the maximum width or height of the 
bloodstain was greater than 0.3 and one of these points was a concave 
point, the end of the tail is identified. All points between these two 
points were removed so the tail was removed. The ellipse was then fitted 
to the resulting polygon using the least squares method [32].
The size of the width and length of the ellipse was then measured. 
The shape of the ellipse was represented in the circularity metric, 
calculated as a ratio of the ellipse width and length. A stain with a 
circularity measure of 1 is circular, a stain with a circularity close to 0 is 
very elongated.
The orientation angle of the stain was measured clockwise from 
vertical from the centre of the bloodstain with the range of between 
0 and 179 degrees. As discussed, to determine the gamma angle the 
horizontal direction of the stain is also required. To determine the 
horizontal direction of each stain a convex hull of the contour line was 
applied and the furthest point on the contour from the centre of the stain 
was determined to be the end of the tail. Differences in the X co-

ordinates between the centre of the stain and the furthest point away 
were calculated with negative values indicating a left direction. For 
stains with left directionality, the gamma angle equates to the angle of 
the stain plus 180 degrees.
For stains that are not particularly elliptical, determining a reliable 
directionality is difficult, if not impossible as tails and protrusions are 
usually not formed, and the leading edge of the stain cannot be identi­
fied. Therefore, a threshold ratio of 0.86 was set (which equates to 
approximately 60-degree angle of impact) as stains made at impact 
angles above this do not usually display tails or protrusions. Thus, 
directionality was not calculated for stains which had a width to length 
ratio greater than 0.86 to ensure only reliable directionality measure­
ments were calculated.
3.5. Pattern metrics
Three pattern metrics were selected for computation: linearity, 
convergence and distribution of stains. The linearity was chosen as a 
mathematical representative of how linear or not a pattern was. It is 
expected that patterns such as cast-off will have a more linear shape than 
radiating patterns from a stationary source of blood such as an impact, 
and therefore may be a useful measurement for discrimination. The 
linearity was calculated by plotting all the stain centroids and fitting 
them to a two-degree polynomial curve using numpy’s “polyfit” function 
with an output graph [33].
A small area of convergence in a pattern indicates that the stains 
originated from a small area, suggesting a stationary source of blood, 
and is expected to be observed in impact patterns (and expirated pat­
terns). To identify the area of convergence, a line following the major 
axis of the ellipse was extended back to the edge of the image for all 
stains with fitted ellipses. A sliding window algorithm over these line 
segments found all of the intersections. A density matrix was calculated 
with the Gaussian kernel density estimator described in [34] with 25 
bins and then plotted using a heat map. A box was fitted around the area 
that contained 60 % of the intersections and the co-ordinates of this box 
were computed.
A convex hull was applied to the entire pattern to calculate the total 
area of the pattern. The distribution of the stains was then calculated in 
two different ways, the first was simply the total number of stains 
divided by the pattern area, and secondly, the total area of the stains 
divided by the pattern area which gave a proportion of the pattern that 
was stains.
3.6. User interface
A user interface was developed to increase usability of the applica­
tion. This enables the user to select which annotations to display, which 
pattern metrics to compute, and which results to export.
The user interface also enables the analyst to zoom in on a selected 
stain when the row representing that stain is selected, creating a link 
between the data and the selected stain. This allows the results to be 
checked against the physical characteristics of the stain to ensure ac­
curacy. Batch processing was also made available so an entire folder of 
images can be processed with no further user interaction.
3.7. Outputs
A digital image of a spatter pattern is used as the input along with the 
known resolution of the image (in pixels per mm). The method delivers 
the individual bloodstain metrics as a comma separated file (containing 
one line for each stain and columns for each metric) and an annotated 
image with selected features displayed. The overall pattern metrics are 
delivered as a further comma separated file, and three graphs are pro­
duced to display convergence, linearity and distribution of the stains. 
The co-ordinates for all boundary pixels for each stains are also pro­
duced in a separate comma separated file, with each row representing

green. Metrics are listed on the left.

the co-ordinates for each stain. This workflow is represented in Fig. 4.
4. Results
The proposed ABPA method was applied to 132 cast-off, 208 impact 
and 132 expirated patterns that were generated in the laboratory as 
previously described in Section 2, and the outputted results scrutinised 
by a trained BPA analyst.
4.1. Segmentation
All bloodstains that were able to be visually identified by the analyst 
in the outputted image file were annotated by the method. This included 
very small stains less than 0.5 mm in diameter. However some false 
positives were detected, such as staple holes and shadows at the edge of 
some images. Any markings from rulers not completely cropped out 
would also be identified as stains as would any non-circular pins present 
in the image.
4.2. Comparison with ImageJ
Three patterns from each class (expirated, cast-off and impact) rep­
resenting a variety of different stains numbers, sizes and intensities were 
analysed with both ImageJ (using the auto thresholding function) and 
the proposed ABPA method and the number of stains identified with 
each were compared. As ImageJ did not have a minimum stain size, a 
count of stains greater than 4 pixels was calculated for the ImageJ results 
for comparisons which are noted in Table 2. It is noted that there was a 
big difference between stain numbers for impact pattern 14 and expi­
rated pattern 87 between the two methods, with the proposed ABPA 
method detecting more stains than ImageJ. When qualitatively 
comparing the binary output of ImageJ with the pattern overlay output 
of the ABPA method it is apparent that ImageJ is not detecting all of the 
stains in the image.
For impact 14 a larger volume of blood was used resulting in larger 
and darker stains within the pattern. As a result, the thresholding for 
ImageJ is not detecting the smaller and fainter stains (Fig. 6). Likewise, 
for the expirated pattern 87, due to the blood substitute being a paler 
colour and then further diluted with saliva during the spitting action to 
create the pattern, many of the stains are pale and these are not all being 
detected by ImageJ.
The propsed ABPA method also coped better with shadows and un­
even lighting. For expirated pattern 53 (Fig. 7) the shadowing on the 
lower portion of the image was counted as stains in ImageJ, and was 
largely ignored with the proposed ABPA method. This is represented in 
the total stain count of 8383 with ImageJ, reducing by nearly half to 
4773 when stains less than 5 pixels are removed. This is much more 
comparable to the 4613 stains identified with the ABPA method. This 
result also validates our decision to limit noise by having a minimum 
stain size of 5 pixels for the proposed ABPA method.
4.3. Comparison with Matlab method
The impact pattern analysed with the Matlab method in [18] was 
made available to the authors and was analysed with our developed 
ABPA method. The proposed ABPA method detected 1623 stains of 10 
pixels or greater, much more than the 420 labelled elements identified in 
the original research paper. The improved segmentation process is likely 
to account for the increase in stains detected, as well as the ability of the 
proposed ABPA method to count and measure all stains not just those 
with fitted ellipses.
Overall, the results indicate that the proposed ABPA method has a 
reliable and sensitive stain segmentation method that copes well with 
shadows and uneven lighting, and different intensity stains and is an 
improvement on both the automated thresholding of ImageJ and the 
previous Matlab developed methodology.
4.4. Ellipse fitting and bloodstain metrics
Ellipses were fitted well to well-formed elliptical and spherical 
stains. However, as the method attempted to fit ellipses to all stains there 
were times when very large ellipses were overlayed onto stains, 
particularly for ones that had flowed, or were overlapping with other 
stains. Examples are shown in Fig. 8. Currently the only solution to 
remove these is to identify these stains using the user interface and

remove their data from the file once it has been saved. Some stains did 
not have enough points around their contour to fit an ellipse. This 
resulted in empty values for the width, height, direction, angle and 
gamma angle, however other metrics such as area and position were still 
able to be measured. The bloodstain metrics for the 11 stains in cast-off 
pattern 103 are displayed in Table 3.
4.5. Pattern metrics
The pattern metric outputs for the three different patterns (impact 
14, cast-off 103 and expirated 9) are displayed in Table 4.
For the linearity, the centroids of the stains were plotted and a 2- 
degree polynomial was fitted to the points (see Fig. 10). The measure 
of how well the points fitted to the curve were represented by the 
calculated R2 value. The R2 values for both the impact and expirated 
patterns were very low indicating the centroid points did not fit well to a 
curved line. The R2 value for the cast-off pattern was higher which is 
expected as this pattern type is more linear than the other two which are 
radiating patterns. As not all cast-off patterns produced stains in a 
strongly linear distribution a large range of R2 values (ranging from 0.1 
to 0.99) were noted for these types of patterns.
Likewise, both density measurements (ratio of the stain number to 
pattern area and ratio of stain area to pattern area) is lowest for cast-off 
which is expected as this pattern has a smaller number of stains. The

expirated pattern has the highest density measurement, which again is 
consistent with this pattern having the largest number of stains. How­
ever, these density measurements appear to be lower than expected for 
expirated and impact and this is likely to be due to the area of the convex 
hull of the pattern being measured larger than it truly is due to false 
positives near the edges of the target. As such it is likely that the density 
measurements for expirated and impact in particular are lower than the 
true values.
The convergence box calculated for cast-off 103 was much larger 
than for the other two patterns reflecting the fact that cast-off patterns 
are not expected to have an area of convergence because the source of 
the blood is not stationary. Fig. 9 shows the convergence heat maps for 
impact 14 and expirated 9, and the centre of these heat maps accurately 
represent the differing positions of the blood source when these patterns 
were created (close to the bottom of the target for impact and centrally 
for expirated). For some cast-off patterns with limited stain numbers the 
convergence was unable to be computed as there were no intersecting 
directional lines.
The convergence metric was the longest pattern metric to calculate 
particularly for patterns with many stains as this created many in­
tersections between the different stains directional paths which had to 
be identified and counted.
5. Conclusions
Our main goal was to increase the objectivity of BPA by developing a 
method that could be used to extract quantitative data, including BPA 
specific metrics, quickly and reliably from digital images of spatter 
bloodstain patterns.
The developed ABPA method described in this paper is an 
improvement on methodologies described in prior research relating to 
quantitative BPA. We have demonstrated that the proposed ABPA 
method has a reliable and sensitive stain segmentation methodology 
that copes well with shadows and uneven lighting, as well as different 
stain intensities, and is an improvement on both ImageJ and the previ­
ously reported Matlab developed method [18]. More stains and less 
background noise and/or false positives were identified with the pro­
posed ABPA method compared to the previously described methodolo­
gies. However, some false positives such as staple holes or marks from 
rulers were still identified as stains.
With regards to the BPA specific metrics, a novel approach to 
ignoring tails and fitting ellipses was established resulting in accurate 
ellipse fitting and therefore accurate impact angle calculations for the 
elliptical stains. A reliable approach to determining the location of the 
tail or spines on the stains and therefore their directionality was also 
developed. Using the directionality and the orientation angle, the BPA 
specific gamma angle was calculated for all stains with a circularity 
below 0.86. However, there were some challenges with irregular shaped 
stains (such as compound stains and flows) and the method struggled to 
fit accurate ellipses to these stains. Implementing a methodology to 
identify overlapping ellipses would improve the outputs of the ABPA

method in the future. Improvements could also be made to the density 
calculations which currently seem overinfluenced by outliers in a 
pattern, which greatly increase the overall pattern size, thus reducing 
the density.
A user interface was also developed which linked stain data to the 
identified stains in the image, allowing for individual stains to be 
identified within the image and scrutinised against their calculated 
metrics. This interface can be used to identify those false positives and 
irregular shaped stains with poorly fitted ellipses. Their metrics can then 
be manually removed from the pattern outputs.
The method coped well with all of the laboratory generated pattern 
images it was applied to (132 cast-off, 208 impact and 132 expirated 
patterns). These images range in overall size, shape and orientation as 
reflected by the differing target sizes used for the different pattern types. 
It was determined from the ABPA method that the number of stains 
present in these patterns ranged from 1 to over 9500 stains. Generally, 
patterns were processed within a few minutes, with patterns containing 
thousands of stains taking longer to calculate the convergence metric 
due to the sheer volume of intersections of the directional lines of the 
stains.
Having demonstrated that the developed ABPA method can cope 
with a range of pattern types and produces accurate and reliable stain 
and pattern metrics it is hoped further researchers will utilise the 
method. By using Python and open source computer vision libraries no 
licenses are required to run the method which is also seen as a benefit as 
it improves accessibility to other analysts and researchers. It is envi­
sioned that the data generated from the dataset of the three spatter 
pattern classes used during this validation process will now be statisti­
cally analysed, with the intention of potentially discovering measurable 
stain and pattern features that will be diagnostic for classifying different 
pattern classes.
