The drying of a drop of human blood exhibits coupled physical mechanisms, such as
Marangoni ﬂow, evaporation and wettability. The ﬁnal stage of a whole blood drop
evaporation reveals regular patterns with a good reproducibility for a healthy person.
Other experiments on anaemic and hyperlipidaemic people were performed, and
diﬀerent patterns were revealed. The ﬂow motion inside the blood drop is observed
and analysed with the use of a digital camera: the inﬂuence of the red blood cells
motion is revealed at the drop periphery as well as its consequences on the ﬁnal
stage of drying. The mechanisms which lead to the ﬁnal pattern of the dried blood
drops are presented and explained on the basis of ﬂuid mechanics in conjunction
with the principles of haematology. The blood drop evaporation process is evidenced
to be driven only by Marangoni ﬂow. The same axisymmetric pattern formation is
observed, and can be forecast for diﬀerent blood drop diameters. The evaporation
mass ﬂux can be predicted with a good agreement, assuming only the knowledge of
the colloids mass concentration.
Key words: bioconvection, blood ﬂow, colloids
1. Introduction
Several patterns can be observed in dried drops of a diﬀerent nature. Coﬀee drops
have been widely studied in the past by demonstrating the inﬂuence of colloids in the
ﬁnal pattern observed (Deegan et al. 1997). Regarding human blood serum (the clear
portion of any liquid separated from its more solid elements), the dried drop of blood
serum presents diﬀerent patterns depending on the individual’s health condition. The
speciﬁc regular pattern characteristics of a healthy individual do not appear in a dried
drop of the blood serum from a person with blood disease (Martusevich, Zimin &
Bochkareva 2007; Shabalin & Shatokhina 2007).
Experimental observations of dried drops of biological ﬂuids (except whole human
blood) have been performed and published in medical journals. The drying process
is not analysed in the literature; they only focus on the ﬁnal pattern in order to
diﬀerentiate healthy people from patients with diseases. The drying technique has
been used to store samples in locations, where appropriate storage conditions are not
available: ﬁeld studies, third world countries, deserts, etc. (Zhuang et al. 1982). The
method was used to detect hepatitis B infection in serum dried on ﬁlter paper. Also,

experimental observations of dried drops of serum have been performed (Yakhno
2008). The author identiﬁed the origin of the patterns observed in dried drops of
serum from the phase transition (gelliﬁcation) of proteins. A strong attachment of
the dried serum due to a biological reaction of the protein with the glass plate of the
microscope and salt crystallization were found in the dried drop, these phenomena
have been explained.
Whole blood is a complex colloidal suspension which behaves like a non-Newtonian
ﬂuid. Since the colloids of blood have complicated shapes, the individual colloid
behaviour is hardly predictable. Pozrikidis (2006) demonstrate the existence of a
molecular adhesion component to explain the ﬂipping behaviour of a platelet over a
plane wall. Besides the ﬂow around these colloids, the biochemistry is also present,
the red blood cells (RBCs) evidence repulsive behaviour near a wall as they do in the
human body to avoid the vessel obstruction. When drops of blood evaporate, all the
colloids are carried by the ﬂow motion inside the drop and interact. These interactions
are governed by ﬂuid mechanics, biology and chemistry. Any modiﬁcation in the drop
evaporation process can reveal a given disease, either an RBC-related disease for
whole blood drop evaporation or another disease for serum drop evaporation.
Similar to those phenomena which we observe with whole blood are presented in
the case of the desiccation of a colloidal suspension (Pauchard, Parisse & Alain 1999).
Crack patterns formed by desiccation of a colloidal suspension in a sessile drop placed
on a glass surface have been observed. Pauchard et al. (1999) demonstrate that the
crack formation is related to the salinity of the suspension and interpreted the pattern
obtained for large drops as buckling instability. The experimental observations with
mica colloids in deionized water (Deegan 2000) were theoretical conﬁrmed by Popov
(2005).
The biological suspension used in this study is real human whole blood from which
the coagulation protein (ﬁbrinogen) has been removed. RBCs are observed thanks to
the relative transparency of a thin layer of blood (less than 500 µm). In this paper,
we will mainly present the dynamic of the process of evaporation using a top view
visualization and the drop mass evolution during the drying process.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental set-up
An experimental set-up was designed to provide a complete geometric characterization
of a posed drop of blood during its evaporation on a substrate. The drops were
deposited on Bioblock glass plates. Environmental conditions (temperature, pressure,
humidity) were recorded using a meteorological station. Evaporation took place in
a parallelepipedic box measuring 100 × 100 × 150 mm3 which remains covered during
the whole duration of the experiment to avoid external ﬂow perturbations. The box
volume is not suﬃcient enough to saturate due to the generation of drop vapour
phase. The image analysis was made by means of a Canon EOS 7d digital camera
coupled with a ×1 to ×5 macro lens. This camera enabled us to obtain 5184 × 3456
pixels on an area of 22.3 × 14.9 mm2. With an enlargement of ×1, the resolution was
4.30 µm, and with the greatest enlargement of ×5 the resolution was 0.86 µm. For
ﬁlms with 30 images s−1, spatial resolution had to be reduced to 1920 by 1080 pixels
(full HD) with a pixel size of 2.30 µm. This optical diagnosis allowed a visualization
of the drop from above in enough detail for further analysis of speciﬁc areas. Drop
evaporation was performed using a cold cathode back light at 5000 ± 270 K without
any surrounding light to avoid reﬂection on the blood drop interface. The eﬀect of the

density of light on the drying process was studied to avoid any biological or chemical
disturbance of the phenomenon. To follow the drying process, the experiment is
performed on a digital accurate weighting balance with a resolution of 10 µg up to
81 g (Mettler Toledo XS 205). The drop is deposited on a microscope glass substrate
(5 g) and then the total mass of the set-up is recorded on a computer at 1 Hz.
2.2. Blood: biological and physical properties
Blood samples were taken in a nearby medical laboratory and stored in their original
10 µl sterile tubes (BD Vacutainer 9NC 0.109M) in a refrigerator at +4◦C, so
that several experiments could be carried out at diﬀerent times. Experiments were
performed at any time from 1 h to 6 days after the sample was drawn, results for
the same person remained almost the same showing that these storage conditions
do not inﬂuence the main drying process. The blood used in this paper was taken
from volunteers of whom some were in good health and others had a disease:
anaemia (reduction below normal of the number of RBCs, quantity of haemoglobin
or the volume of packed RBCs in the blood) or hyperlipidaemia (elevated blood
lipids, particularly triglycerides, after carbohydrate ingestion). The biological ﬂuid
properties have been determined in order to correctly analyse the ﬂow behaviour
observed and the pattern formation. The whole blood and the serum have been
analysed in terms of ﬂuid viscosity using a Physica MCR 501 ‘Anton Paar’ and the
surface tension has been determined using the pendant drop method. At the same
time, a full haematology and biochemistry analysis of the blood has been performed
to obtain the blood characteristics in terms of comosition (haematocrit, lipidaemic
balance). The blood density varies slightly for diﬀerent people in between 1020 and
1060 kg m−3 depending on the blood composition. Considering this small variation in
density (less than 4 %), one assumes a constant whole blood density of 1040 kg m−3
in this study. The blood rheology is obtained in the range of shear stresses from 0.1
to 100 s−1 and is given in (2.1) as
τ = k˙γ n,
(2.1)
with n equal to 0.82 ± 0.01 and k is a constant. This is in agreement with typical results
obtained, indicating that whole blood viscosity is driven by the RBCs concentration
(the haematocrit) (Thieret 2008). For the blood serum, we obtain n = 1.01 ± 0.01,
which is more consistent with a Newtonian ﬂuid. The blood serum does not contain
micrometre-sized colloids, such as RBCs or WBCs, but only ions and proteins. Of the
whole blood drop, 43.9 % volume is RBCs based on haematological analysis. Mass-
wise, 23.9 % of whole blood is composed of colloids which will be remain on the
glass substrate at the end of the drying process. The main blood colloid distribution
is as follows.
(i) Erythrocytes (red blood cells) with 4.9 × 106 units mm−3 and a typical size of
8 µm represent 97 % of the volume of colloids,
(ii) Leukocytes (white blood cells) with 4.3 × 103 units mm−3 and a typical size of
15 µm represent 2 % of the volume of colloids,
(iii) Platelets with 2.4 × 105 units mm−3 and a typical size of 3 µm represent 1 % of
the volume of colloids.
For our analysis in § 3, we will assume that the ﬂuid is mainly composed of 8 µm
diameter colloids at high concentration (about 45 %). Whole blood also contains ions
and proteins which represent 11.6 % by mass of the ﬁnal dried deposit (statistical
values obtained for all experiments were performed using the same blood sample).

The blood surface tension was measured using the pendant drop method with a
capillary tube of 1 mm diameter. The exact capillary tube diameter was measured
to an accuracy of 0.02 mm and blood drop mass was determined to be 10 µg using
an electronic balance. This method gives a statistical value of 69.8 mN m−1 ± 4.6 %
over 72 drops for the full blood and 58.8 mN m−1 ± 4.9 % over 24 drops for the
serum. These values agree with the theoretical values found in the literature, and
they indicate that full blood surface tension is very close to the value obtained for
water, while serum surface tension is of a much lower value. Contact angles were
determined using the sessile drop method where whole blood, serum and water were
dropped onto three substrates: a microscope glass plate without any coating or with
PTFE or epoxy coating, to conﬁrm the surface tension measurements. The values
obtained were close to the value obtained with pure ultra-ﬁltered water as presented
in table 1. Based on physical properties, the full blood used in this study is very close
to water except for the ﬂuid viscosity, which demonstrates non-Newtonian behaviour
(thixotropic ﬂuid).
3. Experiments
3.1. The pattern formation for healthy people
The diﬀerent stages of blood drop evaporation are shown in ﬁgure 1. The initial
drop diameter is 5.9 mm and the enlargement used is ×4.8 to allow visualization of
RBCs. The images for the ﬁlm did not undergo any processing except for cropping
as the original size of each picture was 5184 pixel × 3456 pixel. However, due to
the experimental protocol, the digital camera started taking pictures up to 3 min
after the drop was placed on the plaque. Nevertheless, this delayed starting time was
compensated and is t = 0 min. We present a ﬁlm of the whole evaporation process
online with a playing time which is seven times the real duration, the external drop
diameter is 6.5 mm (supplementary movies available at journals.cambridge.org/ﬂm).
The evaporation/desiccation process can be divided into ﬁve stages which are
detailed below. During the evaporation process, the drop is always pinned on the
substrate. The total evaporation time for the case presented is 36 min and the
durations of the stages are presented as a percentage of the total time of evaporation.
(i) Stage 1 (from 0–20 %): the RBCs move out from the centre of the drop to the
desiccation line which recedes. A red deposit is observed at the edge of the drop. The
measured receding speed of the desiccation line is 0.7 µm s−1.
(ii) Stage 2 (from 20 to 50 %): crystallization appears at the edge of the drop and
propagates inwards. At the same time, the desiccation process continues from the edge
towards the inside of the drop. A dark red torus is observed which demonstrates a
diﬀerent ﬂuid composition. This torus contains a high concentration of RBCs. These
cells are now clearly observed moving from the centre to the edge of the drop.

to 70 %): the dark red torus desiccates rapidly and
simultaneously the colour of the central part of the drop changes to an increasingly
lighter red. The drop is almost totally desiccated and the ﬁrst crack appears around
the drop between the future corona and central part of the drop.

person with anaemia, (c) sample from a 31-year-old man in good health and (d) person with
hyperlipidaemia.
(iv) Stage 4 (from 70 to 85 %): the central part of the drop desiccates producing
much smaller plaques. Desiccation of the corona ﬁnishes and circular drying spots
are observed around the corona.
(v) Stage 5 (from 85 to 100 %): the large plaques of the corona move slightly as
soon as they are totally desiccated. This concludes the desiccation of the drop and no
further changes are observed.
All patterns observed with dried drops of blood present similar characteristics: the
central part of the drop, the wide mobile plaques of the corona with wide white cracks,
and the ﬁne periphery (ﬁgure 2). Whereas the central part of the drop and the ﬁne
periphery stick onto the glass plate due to the absence of RBCs, the corona is where
mobile deposits form and these do not adhere to the substrate. The explanation of
this wetting phenomenon lies in the proteins which exist on the RBCs (glycoproteins).
The function of these proteins is to avoid wettability with a wall and, in particular,
the internal wall of organs, veins.
At the beginning of drop evaporation, the ﬂuid is homogeneous in colloids, this is
why a thin periphery can dry on the glass plate. However, since Marangoni convection
is occurring, the RBCs (and other heavy colloids) accumulate at the drop triple line,
which is receding. The RBCs accumulate by Marangoni convection to form a solid
deposit which will be called hereafter ‘the corona’. The remaining ﬂuid, which consists
mainly of serum without heavy colloids, leads to typical small-sized patterns adhering
to the glass substrate after its evaporation.
3.2. Repeatability and reliability about whole blood experiments
The pattern formation observed in drying drops of blood is totally diﬀerent for
individuals in good health and for those who have a disease. However, for healthy
people, the patterns observed are quite similar and are presented in ﬁgure 3. They are
as follows.

(i) Cases (a) and (c): case (a) is a 27-year-old woman and case (c) is a 31-year-old
man, neither smokes or consumes alcohol on a regular basis. The results of drying
drops of blood for these two cases reveal the same patterns which will be detailed in
§ 4.
(ii) Case (b): the person is anaemic. The external part of the drop corona is very
light-coloured compared to the central part; furthermore, the formation of dark lines
is observed in this area and then the appearance of white lines in a central torus
which corresponds to a non-wetting situation of the blood on the glass substrate.
There are small-sized plaques on the central part of the drop.
(iii) Case (d): the person is hyperlipidaemic. The external part of the drop corona
is thick and ‘greasy’. This external zone is followed by the formation of intermediate
plaques with white lines which also demonstrate a non-wetting situation on the glass
substrate. There are small-sized plaques on the central part of the drop.
4. Discussion
4.1. Physical mechanisms involved
Based on the biological and physical properties of blood obtained in the previous
section, we can estimate the dominating forces. RBC speed can be measured using ﬂow
visualization and is determined to be ∼8 µm s−1. With the blood viscosity and density,
we obtain a Reynolds number for the internal drop ﬂow of Re = ϱUD/µ ≈3 × 10−3,
where ϱ is the whole blood density, U is the average speed estimated using a RBC
displacement, D is the drop radius and µ is the blood viscosity. The capillary number
which compares the viscous and the capillary forces is: Ca = Uµ/σ ≈1.1 × 10−6, where
σ is the blood surface tension. The Rouse number which compares the sedimentation
fall velocity and the shear velocity is: Ro = Us/(k ∗√τ/ϱ) ≈8.2 × 10−5, where Us is
the sedimentation fall velocity (1 mm h−1 during the ﬁrst hour) and k is the Von
K´arm´an constant. Consequently, the ﬂow inside the blood drop is driven only by
Marangoni convection.
To conﬁrm the diﬀerent mechanisms involved in the drying process, we compared
the evaporation mass ﬂux of three drops: blood, serum and pure water on a glass
substrate. The stages of the drops evaporation are all reported in ﬁgure 4, where it
appears that the drying process is mainly driven by the Marangoni ﬂow, since the
blood and serum curves are in agreement with the pure water curve. The colloidal
suspension curves (blood and serum) are corrected by dividing the evaporation mass
ﬂux by the real ﬂuid mass concentration (which is 76.1 % for blood and 88.1 % for
serum, water ﬂuid mass concentration is 100 %, since we use pure distilled ultra-
ﬁltered water). Since the evaporation process is related to the ﬂuid phase transition
to vapour phase, the solid phase of the suspension is not of concern. One notices that
when the blood drop is deposited on the glass substrate, the evaporation mass ﬂux is
slightly more important compared with the pure water case. Then this enhancement
tends to disappear with time while the colloid concentration changes.
At the beginning of the experiment, the blood drop is deposited and its shape
is hemispherical. The RBCs are homogeneously dispersed inside the drop which is
about 0.5 mm in thickness and 6 mm in diameter. Marangoni ﬂow is acting (see
the supplementary movie), the RBCs movement from the inner of the drop to the
periphery is clearly observed. The blood drop desiccates since the water contained in it
is evaporating. At the same time due to Marangoni ﬂow, the RBCs are accumulating
at the drop periphery creating a layer of biological deposit (cellular components).
From 50 % of evaporation time, the drop shape is no more classical with a central

ﬂat area. Marangoni ﬂow is no longer possible and the remaining RBCs are trapped
into the central area of the drop, while most of the cellular components have been
deposited in the drop corona area. At 70 % of the total evaporation time, the central
area of the drop starts to completely desiccate and evidences small-sized pattern
formation. This last stage of the process is characterized by a sharp decrease of
the evaporation mass ﬂux, since the remaining water is that which is inside the
RBCs. Finally, after 85 % of the total evaporation time, the RBCs which are just
shells containing the haemoglobin, crack and free the remaining liquid which can
evaporate. This leads to a typical cross-section deposit which can also be called a
‘donut’ shape.
The drying process behaviour based on the evaporation mass ﬂow rate is not
modiﬁed by the drop diameter as presented in ﬁgure 5. After this, the evaporation
mass ﬂux sharply decreases. This second dynamic is clearly related to the absence
of convection, since the drop is now mainly a solid with a small amount of liquid
remaining inside the red blood cells. The last stage of the drop evaporation consists of
the red blood cells shell cracking, which releases the haemoglobin. This last stage of
evaporation takes more time since the ﬂuid has to migrate through the solid deposit,
which does not wet the glass microscope plate.
As evidenced in ﬁgures 4 and 5, the evaporation dynamics can be scaled assuming
that the blood is a colloidal suspension composed of pure water and 23.9 % by
mass RBCs 8 µm in diameter and the serum as a colloidal suspension of pure water

investigated, the same evaporation dynamics is observed like for pure water. Thus, the
total evaporation time can be predicted based on the blood haematologic composition
by comparison with pure water.
4.2. Axisymmetric pattern formation
Depending on the diameter, cracks can be observed as shown in ﬁgure 6, where we
present drops with diﬀerent diameters formed simultaneously from the same blood
with the same experimental conditions. The drop with a diameter of 3.8 mm shows
no wide axisymmetric cracks, whereas the drop which is 5.4 mm in diameter clearly
shows periodic cracks around the corona. This cracking phenomenon is only observed
above a critical diameter which for this case is 4.2 mm. The mechanical stresses inside
the solid deposit desiccating can be advanced as the origin of this cracking. The
formation of wide cracks is similar to the desiccation of drops of nanoparticles on
glass plates studied by Pauchard, Abou & Sekimoto (2009) to which the RBCs in
the present case may easily be compared. Pauchard et al. (2009) observed cracking
which depended on the initial concentration and deformability of nanoparticles. In
our study, the concentration and shape of RBCs can lead to the same consequences
on the ﬁnal patterns observed. The corona of the drop is mainly composed of RBCs
which have been deposited by internal drop convection. Thus, the central part of the
remaining blood is less and less rich in RBCs. After stage 4, the liquid remaining in
the central area of the drop contains mainly proteins, white blood cells, blood platelets
and a few amount of RBCs. All these elements present hydrophilic behaviour with
glass and wet the substrate.
For small drops below a critical value, drop evaporation which is related to the
volume to be dried, is much faster. For large drops with a diameter of more than
4.2 mm, evaporation takes place over 30 min and Marangoni convection observed

through RBC motion is noticeable. RBCs accumulate at the edge of the drop. When
the desiccation phenomenon occurs on the glass substrate, a decrease in volume is
observed due to the large amount of water required. During the desiccation process,
stress inside the solid deposit of desiccated blood built up and induced surface cracks
periodically releasing the stress. Furthermore, the RBCs present at their surface
proteins induce a hydrophobic behaviour with all materials. This is observed with
glass. The dried RBCs at this position in the drop do not wet the substrate and
reveal an hydrophobic behaviour. This enables a cracking phenomenon linked with
the diameter of the drop, and consequently with the perimeter of the corona. For
small drop perimeters, the stress inside the RBCs solid deposit is small compared
with large drop diameters.
5. Concluding remarks
Observations of the Marangoni ﬂow motion inside a drop of blood using a digital
camera at a good resolution (about 2.3 µm) enable us to show that the motion of
RBCs at the edge of the drop is the main mechanism of blood drop evaporation and
deposition. The mechanisms involved in the blood drop evaporation are conﬁrmed
through the evaporation mass ﬂux which is measured to be in agreement with a
pure water drop evaporation. Other biological elements (white blood cells, proteins)
are transported to the edge of the drop with the RBCs and contribute to the
pattern formation through the deposit wettability with the substrate and mechanical
properties. The blood evaporation dynamic can be predicted by a comparison with
the pure ﬂuid evaporation case corrected by the mass concentration in colloids.
Totally diﬀerent patterns are formed according to whether the person is healthy or
suﬀers from anaemia or hyperlipidaemia. This is leading our research to correlate the
pattern formation with blood diseases. An analysis of the corona of the drop reveals
the presence of large solid plaques measuring several hundred micrometres which are

clearly visible for a normal individual, but are absent for someone with a disease.
This simple, reliable and inexpensive indicator could be used for the diagnosis of
blood diseases. The ﬂuid mechanics involved in this real colloid suspension include
convection of the main colloids (cellular components), but also evidences hydrophobic
behaviour between the RBCs and the substrate, which modify the pattern observed
after the drop has desiccated. An explanation for nonlinear evolution of the number
of cracks with increasing diameter is currently being prepared, in conjunction with
elements of solid mechanics.
