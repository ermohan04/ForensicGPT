ABSTRACT: We investigate the impact velocity beyond which the ejection
of smaller droplets from the main droplet (splashing) occurs for droplets of
diﬀerent liquids impacting diﬀerent smooth surfaces. We examine its
dependence on the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension.
We show that the splashing velocity is independent of the wetting properties
of the surface but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of
the liquid. A preexisting splashing model and simpliﬁcation are considered
that predict the splashing velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. Both the splashing model and simpliﬁcation give a good
prediction of the splashing velocity for each surface and liquid, demonstrating the robustness of the splashing model. We also
show that the splashing model can also predict the splashing velocity of blood, a shear-thinning ﬂuid.
■INTRODUCTION
When impacting a dry, smooth surface, a droplet either spreads
over the surface (for low-impact velocities) or disintegrates
into smaller droplets (for high-impact velocities). This so-
called splashing phenomenon has been the subject of
numerous studies over the last several decades and is of
relevance for a wide range of practical applications such as crop
spraying,1,2 rain drops impacting porous stones,3,4 and forensic
research.5−7 The splashing velocity vsp is deﬁned as the critical
value of the impact velocity of the droplet beyond which
splashing occurs (Figure 1). Many studies have tried to ﬁnd an
empirical relation between the splashing velocity and ﬂuid
parameters8−13 and between the splashing velocity and surface
properties.14−17 In addition, Xu et al.18 showed that the
atmospheric conditions have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on droplet
splashing,13,17,19 implying that the air viscosity is also an
important parameter. To include the air viscosity, Riboux and
Gordillo recently proposed a theoretical model for impact and
splashing on smooth surfaces.20 They postulated that splashing
occurs because of the breakup of a small liquid ﬁlm that lifts oﬀ
the surface just after the impact due to the lift force generated
by the surrounding air. In the model, the ﬂuid and substrate
properties govern the splashing as well as the air viscosity; in
ref 20, a quantitative agreement was found between the model
and experiments on a single substrate.
Numerous experimental studies have investigated splash-
ing;8−19 however, the inﬂuence of the wetting properties of the
surface on splashing has not been considered in detail. It has
recently been shown that the wetting properties of the surface
aﬀect droplet spreading at low-impact velocities.21,22 In the
model of Riboux and Gordillo, the splashing velocity also
depends on the surface properties.20 The surface tension and
the wetting properties of the surface are closely linked through
Young’s law.23 Therefore, the dependence of the splashing
velocity on surface tension should also be taken into account
for a droplet of a given size. Furthermore, the splashing model
has not yet been tested for more complex ﬂuids such as, for
example, blood. In forensics, being able to determine when
blood splashes could help in distinguishing between the stains
that are formed from the droplet impact (impact stain) or the
stains formed by absorbing blood during contact with a blood
source (transfer stain).7,24 Blood is a shear-thinning ﬂuid, but
studies have shown that blood can be approximated as a
Newtonian ﬂuid when it is subjected to high shear rates.25−27
Laan et al. showed in 2014 that the spreading of blood is
similar to the spreading of Newtonian ﬂuids, which was
attributed to the high shear rate inside the droplet during
spreading.21 As splashing occurs during spreading (Figure 1b),
the questions are whether blood can also be approximated as a
Newtonian ﬂuid during splashing and whether the splashing
velocity of blood can also be predicted using the splashing
model for Newtonian ﬂuids of ref 20.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the eﬀect of
surface tension of the liquid and the wetting properties of the
surface on the splashing velocity of the droplet. Using high-

speed camera footage, we measure the splashing velocity of a
set of Newtonian ethanol−water mixtures and shear-thinning
blood impacting on diﬀerent surfaces at laboratory conditions.
We compare the results with the splashing model of Riboux
and Gordillo.20 We show that the splashing model predicts the
splashing of both ethanol−water mixtures and blood very well.
Although the model is consistent with the experimental data,
the calculation is complex and depends on several parameters
that have to be inferred from the experimental conditions and
have to be calculated separately. We therefore use a
simpliﬁcation, also given by Riboux and Gordillo, valid for
low Ohnesorge numbers and atmospheric conditions, which is
the situation that pertains to most practical applications and
show that it predicts the splashing velocity very well. These
results show that the splashing velocity is independent of the
surface wetting properties and that blood can be approximated
as a Newtonian ﬂuid during splashing.
■MATERIALS AND METHODS
To measure the splashing velocity vsp, droplet impacts were recorded
using a high-speed camera (Phantom Miro M310). The droplets were
generated from a blunt-tipped needle (needle diameter 0.4 mm) using
a syringe pump, where the needle was suspended above the substrate
at a certain height. By systematically increasing the height of the
needle and checking whether the droplet merely spreads over the
surface (Figure 1a) or splashes (Figure 1b) for each height, we
determined the initial droplet diameter D0 and impact velocity v at the
onset of splashing for each liquid. The ﬂuid parameters of each liquid
are given in Table 1. Three diﬀerent surfaces were investigated for the
ethanol−water mixtures: stainless steel, glass (Objektträger, Menzel
Glaser, Thermo Scientiﬁc), and paraﬁlm. All three surfaces were
considered smooth, each having an arithmetic average roughness Ra
below 0.5 μm.22 For blood, the splashing velocity was determined
from blood droplet impact footage on glass (θst ≈20°; where θst is the
static contact angle of water21), acrylic glass [poly(methyl
methacrylate), PMMA; θst ≈70°], Trespa (θst ≈82°), and
polyoxymethylene (POM; θst ≈79°) surfaces using the data of ref
21. The density (1055 kg/m3), surface tension (59 mN/m), and
viscosity (4.8 mPa·s) of the blood used are also given by Laan et al.21
Both the impacts of Newtonian ﬂuids and blood were measured at 21
°C and atmospheric pressure. During the experiments with blood, the
anti-coagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was added to prevent
the coagulation of blood.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For each ethanol−water mixture, the contact angle θ on steel,
glass, and paraﬁlm was measured using the sessile drop
method.30,31 Because of surface inhomogeneities, a droplet
deposited on a surface does not have a unique contact angle
but attains a contact angle that ranges between the advancing
(θa) and receding (θr) contact angle.32 In Figure 2a, θa is
plotted as a function of the surface tension. In glass, the
contact angles of each ﬂuid were too small to be determined.
Therefore, each ﬂuid is considered to be completely wetting
the glass surface (θa ≈0°). Do note that the glass used in this
study has a lower contact angle compared to the glass used in
the study of ref 21. All liquids have a similar receding angle of
roughly 20° when deposited on steel. When deposited on
paraﬁlm, the receding contact angles of all liquids were
consistently 10° lower than their corresponding advancing
angle.
To characterize the diﬀerence in wetting properties of the
three substrates, Young’s law is used, which describes the force
balance between the interfacial tensions of the substrate, liquid
droplet, and the surrounding vapor23,33

σSV and σSL are the solid−vapor and solid−liquid interfacial

between σSV and σSL is a property of the solid that gives the
surface free energy of the substrate.23,31,34 (σSV −σSL) can be
determined by ﬁnding the critical surface tension from the
contact angle measurements: the surface tension at which a

droplet completely wets the surface. By plotting the cosine of
the measured contact angles as a function of surface tension
(Figure 2b), (σSV −σSL) is found by ﬁtting a straight line
through the data using the least squares method and
extrapolating the ﬁts to the surface tension for which the
liquid would fully wet the surface (cos(θ) = 1). Because glass is
completely wetted by all evaluated liquids, the critical surface
tension of glass is higher than 71.99 mN/m. For steel and
paraﬁlm, a critical surface tension of 14 ± 1 and 19 ± 1 mN/m
is found, respectively. Therefore, liquids wet the paraﬁlm less
compared to the steel surface.
The measured splashing velocities of the ethanol−water
mixtures are plotted as a function of liquid surface tension in
Figure 3a. The graph shows that the splashing velocity
increases roughly linearly with the surface tension. For pure
water droplets, no splashing was observed within the velocity
range investigated here (0.1 < v < 4.7 m/s). No signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the three evaluated surfaces is observed,
implying that the splashing velocity is independent of the
wetting properties of the substrate. The same holds for blood
(Figure 3b), where the splashing velocity remains constant
(∼3.47 m/s) for all observed substrates. These results suggest
that the wetting properties of the substrate do not inﬂuence the
splashing velocity of both ethanol−water mixtures and blood,
which is the ﬁrst useful conclusion. This is remarkable as the
droplet is in full contact with the substrate during splash-
ing.35,36 However, in ref 35, it was also observed that just
before splashing, the edge of the liquid sheet dewets the
surface from which the satellite droplets are formed (see Figure
4a−d).
Although surface roughness is not considered in this paper,
it can also inﬂuence splashing.16,17 On rough surfaces, the
liquid sheet does not detach from the surface prior to breakup,
giving rise to a diﬀerent splash known as a “prompt splash”.9,17
The inﬂuence of surface roughness was not considered in the
splashing model of ref 20. How the surface roughness can be
incorporated into the splashing model is currently unknown
and beyond the scope of this paper.
To describe splashing, in ref 20, the ejection time te (the
moment a thin liquid sheet appears from the droplet after
impact) is ﬁrst calculated numerically using the momentum

Using the sheet velocity and thickness, the aerodynamic
lifting force, consisting of the suction (∼KlμgVt) and
lubrication forces (∼KuρgVt
2Ht), can then be determined.
Here, μg and ρg are the viscosity and density of the air,
respectively. The suction force is caused by the negative
pressure diﬀerence above the liquid sheet due to the Bernoulli
principle, whereas the lubrication force is generated by the air
moving underneath the liquid sheet, creating a positive
pressure diﬀerence that pushes the lamella upward. Ku and
Kl are constants. While Ku ≈0.3 was determined in ref 20 by
numerical calculations, Kl can be calculated using the sheet
thickness, mean free path of the molecules λ in the
surrounding air, and wedge angle α, which is the angle
between the lifted sheet and the surface

According to ref 20, the wedge angle is equal to 60° and
should be dependent on the wetting properties of the surface.20
Having determined these parameters, a dimensionless

Comparing eqs 2 and 5 to both their own experiments and
previous work,13,18,37 Riboux and Gordillo determined that the
value of the splashing ratio should be around 0.14.
To calculate the splashing velocity from the splashing model
of Riboux and Gordillo, eq 2 is rewritten as a quadratic

Using eqs 6 and 7, the ejection time can be determined
numerically, which in turn can be used to calculate the
splashing velocity. For both Newtonian ﬂuids and blood, the
measured droplet radius was averaged. The best ﬁt of the
splashing model on our data (green line, Figure 3a,b) was
determined by minimizing the sum of square residuals using
the splashing ratio as a ﬁt parameter. The obtained best ﬁt
value is equal to 0.135 ± 0.008, which is close to the value 0.14
found by Riboux and Gordillo. The error on the splashing ratio
is determined by calculating the splashing ratio for each ﬂuid
and taking the SD of all splashing ratios. Previously, the
splashing model was only veriﬁed for borosilicate glass
substrates.13,37 Here, we show that the splashing model can
be universally applied to any smooth surface. Furthermore, the
splashing model also accurately predicts the splashing
velocities of blood (Figure 3b), where the splashing ratio of
blood is nearly identical to the splashing ratio of the ethanol−
water mixtures (βblood = 0.141 ± 0.001). The fact that blood
can be described with the splashing model of Riboux and
Gordillo suggests that blood behaves as a Newtonian ﬂuid
during splashing, similar to droplet spreading.21
The wetting properties of the surface should, according to
Riboux and Gordillo,20 determine the wedge angle α.
However, Riboux and Gordillo gave no explanation on why
the value of the wedge angle should be 60°. To investigate the
time dynamics of the wedge angle during splashing, we
measure the wedge angle; in our experiments, we let ethanol
droplets impact a stainless-steel surface at an impact velocity
comparable to the splashing velocity (v = vsp). Recording the
impact with the high-speed camera gives the time evolution of
liquid sheet expansion, which is depicted in Figure 4a−d. We
observe that after the moment of the sheet ejection (Figure
4a), the liquid sheet starts to radially expand outward (Figure
4b). After a certain time, liquid ﬁngers start to form at the edge
of the sheet (Figure 4c), after which satellite droplets detach
from the sheet (Figure 4d) and splashing occurs.
From each recorded frame, we extracted the instantaneous
wedge angle, which is shown in Figure 4e. In this graph, the
wedge angle seems to increase linearly with time until the
moment of ﬁnger formation (Figure 4c). Assuming that the
wedge angle keeps increasing linearly until droplet detachment,
we can ﬁt a simple linear function (α = At) to the data of
Figure 4e and extrapolate the wedge angle to the moment the
droplets detach from the liquid sheet. Using this method, we
obtain an average wedge angle of α = 59° ± 8° at the moment
of droplet detachment (Figure 4d), which is similar to the
value of the wedge angle postulated by Riboux and Gordillo.
These results, therefore, show that the wedge angle given in ref
20 should be the wedge angle at the moment of droplet
detachment because the angle varies continuously in time. The
important conclusion from our experiments is that the wedge
angle does not depend on the surface and the behavior found
here is therefore universal.
Although the splashing model of Riboux and Gordillo
provides a good prediction of the splashing velocity, the
required calculations are rather complex: substitute eq 6 into
eq 7, numerically solve for te, and use the result to ﬁnd the
splashing velocity with eq 6. Furthermore, these calculations
depend on several unintuitive parameters, for instance α and λ.
Most practical situations deal with ﬂuids with a low
Ohnesorge number (Oh ≪1) and take place at atmospheric
conditions. Riboux and Gordillo also proposed a simpliﬁcation
for low Oh ﬂuids and found an approximate splash criteria that
also showed good agreement with previous experiments.10,37
However, no detailed comparison was made between the
splashing velocity prediction of both the simpliﬁcation and the
full-splashing model. It is unknown whether the deviation
between the full splashing model and simpliﬁcation is small
enough to provide an accurate splashing velocity prediction
with simpliﬁcation. Therefore, we will follow the same
approximations given by Riboux and Gordillo and compare

Further simpliﬁcation can be made for the constant Kl [eq

initial diameter of the drops, an average value of 7.41 × 10−6 m
is obtained. Because λ ≈10−8 m, the ratio λ/Ht is in the order
of 10−3. As λ/Ht is small, the second logarithmic term can be

Thus, it is possible to signiﬁcantly simplify Riboux and

and atmospheric conditions, where the splashing ratio is only
dependent on the ﬂuid parameters and viscosity of the air, as
the wedge angle seems to be identical for all smooth surfaces.

Then, the splashing velocity is uniquely determined by
density, surface tension, and initial diameter of the droplet,
viscosity of the air, wedge angle, and splashing ratio. The
simpliﬁcation (red dashed line), when plotted together with
the experimental data and the full splashing model, as shown in
Figure 3, shows good agreement. Again, the splashing ratio
(βsimpl) was used as a ﬁtting parameter, where the best ﬁt value
of βsimpl of the ethanol−water mixtures is equal to 0.120 ±
0.008, which is slightly lower than the splashing ratio of the full
splashing model. This is expected as the suction force term is
neglected in the simpliﬁcation. For blood (red open symbols;
Figure 3b), the splashing ratio also decreases (βsimpl,blood =
0.112 ± 0.001), but still attains a similar value as the splashing
ratio of the ethanol−water mixtures. The predicted values of
the full splashing model and the simpliﬁcation are similar,
which shows that the simpliﬁcation gives a relatively good
prediction of the splashing velocity for both ethanol−water
mixtures and blood.
■CONCLUSION
To summarize, we systematically investigated the inﬂuence of
the wetting properties of the surface on the splashing velocity
of Newtonian ﬂuid and blood (a shear thinning liquid)
droplets impacting a smooth surface. We showed that the
wetting properties do not inﬂuence the splashing velocity for
both Newtonian ﬂuids and blood, indicating that splashing is
independent of the wetting properties of the surface. Then, we
compared the experimental data with a preexisting splashing
model and showed that the model can be universally applied to
any smooth surface. Furthermore, the splashing model can also
be used to predict the splashing velocity of blood. By
measuring the wedge angle, we conﬁrmed that the wedge
angle used in the splashing model is equal to 60° at the
moment of droplet detachment from the liquid sheet. Finally,
we evaluated a simpliﬁcation of the preexisting splashing model
for low Ohnesorge number ﬂuids at atmospheric conditions.
We showed that the predictions of the simpliﬁcation are
comparable to the full splashing model, allowing for an easier
prediction of splashing of low Ohnesorge number ﬂuids at
atmospheric conditions for any smooth surface.
