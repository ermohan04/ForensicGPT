Abstract
A drop hitting a solid surface can deposit, bounce, or splash. Splashing arises
from the breakup of a ﬁne liquid sheet that is ejected radially along the sub-
strate. Bouncing and deposition depend crucially on the wetting properties
of the substrate. In this review, we focus on recent experimental and theoret-
ical studies, which aim at unraveling the underlying physics, characterized
by the delicate interplay of not only liquid inertia, viscosity, and surface ten-
sion, but also the surrounding gas. The gas cushions the initial contact; it
is entrapped in a central microbubble on the substrate; and it promotes the
so-called corona splash, by lifting the lamella away from the solid. Particular
attention is paid to the inﬂuence of surface roughness, natural or engineered
to enhance repellency, relevant in many applications.

1. INTRODUCTION
The ﬁngering of an ink blot or a coffee stain is familiar to everyone. However, despite 140 years
of study (Worthington 1876), the underlying rapid dynamics of the impact process eluded expla-
nation until the past 20 years, when high-speed video technology began to allow time-resolved
observations of this intriguing phenomenon (Thoroddsen et al. 2008). The increasing pace of sen-
sor improvements and availability is allowing the study of ever-ﬁner detail and is reinvigorating
research in this area of study, as demonstrated by the large number of very recent references cited
herein. This imaging technology is now reaching the diffraction limit of spatial resolution and sub-
microsecond interframe times (Li & Thoroddsen 2015, Visser et al. 2015). This is being matched
by increasing computational power and improved numerical algorithms to allow fully resolved
simulations in the axisymmetric conﬁguration (Thoraval et al. 2012), and fully three-dimensional
(3D) cases, from ﬁrst contact, should soon follow (Agbaglah et al. 2011).
We strictly conﬁne our review to impacts on solid surfaces and leave out studies involving
impacts on pools or ﬁlms of liquid. Moreover, we emphasize recent works [i.e., appearing after
the earlier review by Yarin (2006) in this journal, which dealt with impacts on both solid and
liquid surfaces].
Studies of drop impacts are driven by several areas relevant both in nature and in industry.
In nature, a drop of water hollows a stone, and splashing produces aerosols, causes erosion, and
brings the smell of the earth during rain ( Joung & Buie 2015). In industry, there are spray/wall
interactions in coating, cleaning, cooling, and combustion. Inkjet droplets play an increasing role
in fabrication, from the soldering of electronics to microarrays in biotechnology.

illumination, triggered by a marble falling in tandem with the drop (Figure 1a). He then sketched
his ﬂash-illuminated visions of the impact of a mercury drop (Figure 1b), with interesting ﬁnger-
like spokes on the spreading lamella. However, with modern technology, we have reproduced
his impact conditions (i.e., 1/15-inch drop diameter and 3-inch impact height) but see no such
radial spokes (Figure 1c). One possible explanation for the different results involves soot, which
Worthington used to superhydrophobize his spectacle glass for releasing the drop (soot also works
well as an oleophobic coating; see Deng et al. 2012). This might have formed a coating on the
drop; an oxidized layer may have formed; or simply the ﬂash duration was too long and smeared
out the edge bumps into radial streaks, as suggested in the celebrated review by Rein (1993).
To deﬁne the different parameters involved in drop impacts, we consider as a prototype the
normal impact of a spherical liquid drop on a ﬂat solid substrate. The drop diameter is D = 2R,
and the normal impact velocity is V. The liquid and surrounding gas have densities ρℓand ρg, and
dynamical (kinematic) viscosities μℓ(νℓ= μℓ/ρℓ) and μg (νg = μg /ρg), respectively. The surface
tension is denoted by γ and the gravity by g, which is oriented along the vertical direction.
As stated above, the canonical impact problem depends a priori on ﬁve dimensionless param-
eters. In fact, considering the balance between gravity and inertia through the Froude number
Fr = V/√g D, one can show that gravity can be neglected. Indeed, for usual impact conditions, we
ﬁnd that Fr ≫1 so that only four dimensionless parameters are pertinent for the impact dynam-
ics, although gravity plays a crucial role in the experiment by accelerating the drop until it reaches
its impact velocity. In general, the impact dynamics were ﬁrst characterized by the Reynolds and
Weber numbers, deﬁned with the liquid properties as
Re = ρℓDV
μℓ
and
We = ρℓDV 2

which balance the inertia with the viscous and the capillary forces, respectively. Alternatively, the
Ohnesorge and capillary numbers are often used in the literature, yielding
Oh =

and

Additionally, there are the two ratios of the liquid-gas densities and viscosities, ρℓ/ρg and μℓ/μg.
Instead of the use of the viscosity ratio, it is convenient to introduce the Stokes number to quantify
the inﬂuence of the gas in the lubrication layer beneath the drop before impact:
St =

ρℓDV = μg

Re .
Finally, other dimensionless parameters can be present in the dynamics, often hidden in the
literature, and related to the drop shape (e.g., the aspect ratio of the drop at impact) or the substrate
properties (in particular, the contact angle θe and roughness distribution).
2. EARLY CONTACT: CENTRAL BUBBLE AND SKATING ON AIR
2.1. Central Bubble
Under atmospheric conditions, a drop impacting perpendicularly to a wall will always entrap a
small air bubble under its center. The drop approaches the solid surface inside a gas, which must be
displaced before contact. When the drop gets close to the surface, the lubrication pressure in the
thin air layer due to the gas viscosity becomes strong enough to deform its bottom into a dimple
and thus transform a point contact into one along a ring, with a thin disk of air entrapped. The air
disk contracts rapidly into a central bubble on the substrate to minimize the surface energy. This

bubble was observed in the snapshots (Chandra & Avedisian 1991, Thoroddsen & Sakakibara
1998) and under inkjet droplets (Van Dam & Le Clerc 2004), but without clear explanation of
its formation. Thoroddsen et al. (2005) used high-speed video to directly observe the initial air
disk and its contraction. Measuring the volume of air in the resulting bubble, they estimated the
initial average thickness of the air disk in the range δ ∼2–5 µm. The contraction speed was
successfully modeled with capillary-inertial dynamics by assuming that the layer is uniform but
increases in thickness during the reduction in radius. This gives an expression for the disc radius
versus time, R = R0 exp[−C√πσ/ρ
b t], in close agreement with the measurements. Here the
constant C ≃0.94, and 
b is the bubble volume. However, the edge of the contracting air sheet
thickens. Thus, the disk is not of uniform thickness, which is perhaps most clearly visible in the
X-ray imaging of Lee et al. (2012). This led Liu et al. (2013) to improve on the above expression,
adding corrections to the contraction rate.
Recent advances have used high-speed interferometry to directly measure the radial thickness
proﬁle of the air disc. Interferometry fringes can easily give radial changes in the layer thickness,
with a resolution of λ/4 ∼150 nm between a dark and a bright fringe (Driscoll et al. 2010,
Driscoll & Nagel 2011, Liu et al. 2013). However, more sophisticated methods must be applied
to obtain absolute thicknesses, including two-color techniques (de Ruiter et al. 2012) and white-
light interferometry (van der Veen et al. 2012). Two-color techniques can give extraordinary
subfringe thickness resolution, approximately 30 nm (de Ruiter et al. 2015b). These techniques
have primarily been applied to low-impact velocities, speciﬁcally the study of bouncing dynamics
(de Ruiter et al. 2015a). However, with 50-ns laser pulses for each video frame, interferometry
can be realized at 5 Mfps (Li & Thoroddsen 2015) to obtain the time-resolved evolution of the
air-layer proﬁle for higher impact velocities (Figure 2c,d).
The contraction of the air disc into the central bubble also does not come without surprises.
Thoroddsen et al. (2005) showed that the retracting edge produces capillary waves, which propa-
gate toward the center. Sometimes the apex of this converging wave touches the substrate at the
axis of symmetry and pinches off a microdrop within the central bubble (Figure 2). Lee et al.
(2012) veriﬁed these proposed dynamics using X-ray imaging (Figure 2b). Their images even
reveal a subsatellite formed inside the bubble inside the drop.
2.2. Modeling the Air-Layer Thickness
The deformation of the bottom of the drop, the formation of the dimple, and subsequent en-
trapment of the air disc are governed by a balance between the drop’s inertia and the lubrication
pressure in the air, which tries to escape the oncoming drop. The air-layer cushioning was ﬁrst
modeled by looking at 2D cases (Smith et al. 2003, Korobkin et al. 2008), later adapted to the
axisymmetric conﬁguration, which exhibits the same scaling (Hicks & Purvis 2010). Here the dy-
namics assume viscous lubrication pressure in the air layer, which, for small separation distances,
starts to deform the drop inviscidly. These rapid motions can neglect surface tension, liquid vis-
cosity, and gravity. The dimensional argument is essentially the following (Mandre et al. 2009):
The separation distance H between the drop and solid must become small enough so that the
lubrication pressure in this thin air layer, P ∼μgVR/H 2, becomes strong enough to rapidly decel-
erate the bottom tip of the drop. There, the horizontal/radial scaling used is
√
DH , coming from
geometrical arguments. The deceleration a occurs over this distance H, in the very short available
time τ ∼H/V , giving ρℓa ∼ρℓV/τ ∼ρℓV 2/H . Equating these two effects gives a characteristic
thickness for the start of drop deformation involving the Stokes number, H ∗= R St2/3.

is in reasonable agreement with available data (Liu et al. 2013, Thoroddsen et al. 2005), without
any adjustable constants, but one must use the bottom radius of curvature of the falling drop
for R.
2.3. Gas Compressibility
Building on the previous incompressible theory (Smith et al. 2003, Korobkin et al. 2008), Mandre
et al. (2009) found conditions, for higher impact velocities, at which the compressibility of the

gas comes into play. This effect is included in the lubrication equation for the gas in a low–Mach
number approximation and is expressed in terms of a compressibility factor
ϵ =
Patm
(RV 7ρ4
ℓ/μg)1/3 .
(2)
If ϵ−1 ≳5, one expects compression of the air disc and smaller values of H∗. This thinning should
scale as H ∗/(RbSt2/3) = 3.2ϵ1/3. Li & Thoroddsen (2015) recently carried out interferometry
experiments for ϵ−1 as high as 40, verifying this theory and the corresponding numerics of Mandre
et al. (2009) for adiabatic compression. The measured disc thickness, at the centerline, is as thin
as H ∗∼0.5 µm.
Hicks & Purvis (2013) added more thermodynamics into the equation of state for the gas.
Furthermore, although their compressible theory is limited to two dimensions, they showed
that Lo is not dependent on the gas compressibility. This has indeed been borne out by Li
& Thoroddsen (2015), who found a perfect ﬁt of Lo to Equation 1, over a large range of
impact values, well into the compressible regime. This ﬁnding contradicts Liu et al.’s (2013)
earlier results, in which smaller water drops were used and Lo was essentially independent
of V.
The air ﬁlm should continue to thin at even higher impact velocities. Indeed, perhaps surpris-
ingly, single central bubbles are observed in the snapshots of Mehdizadeh et al. (2004) for V as
high as 40 m/s, where ϵ−1 ≃1,360 (Figure 7). The corresponding air-disc thickness is predicted
to be H ∗≃15 nm, at which stage one might expect molecular forces to break up the air layer
before contraction into the bubble.
2.4. Size of the Entrapped Bubble
The size of the entrapped air bubble is important in inkjet-based fabrication, as it can have detri-
mental effects, for example, on uniformity and conductance. For minuscule impact velocities, the
lubricating air ﬁlm can become unstable and break the axisymmetry, allowing the air to escape (see
Klaseboer et al. 2000). The lowest velocities can also lead to isolated contacts and spreading with
minimal air entrapment (Kolinski et al. 2012, de Ruiter et al. 2015a). Bouwhuis et al. (2012) applied
interferometry to investigate the size of the entrapped air layer and found a maximum, which occurs
at a moderate impact velocity, at which compressibility can be ignored. This arises because of com-
petition between the surface tension and inertia of the liquid. For low-enough impact velocities,
the surface tension minimizes the drop deformation away from a spherical shape and H ∗∼St1/2.
At higher velocities, inertia dominates, and the dynamic pressure grows as a square of velocity,
thus draining out more air, which reduces H ∗∼St2/3, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Mandre
et al. (2009). Between these two considerations is a maximum, with a crossover at Stc ∼Ca3/4
g
[where Cag =

/ γ is the capillary number based on the gas viscosity] or expressed in a
critical impact velocity V c ∼(μgσ 3 /ρ4
ℓR4)1/7. For their ethanol drop, with R = 0.9 mm, they get
V c = 0.25 m/s. Klaseboer et al. (2014) proposed a different power law for the large–impact velocity
regime, H ∼St1/2, arising from the use of a different velocity potential in the drop than that used by
Bouwhuis et al. (2012).
Hendrix et al. (2015) proposed a model unifying three impact conﬁgurations—a drop onto a
solid, a solid sphere onto a pool (Marston et al. 2011), and a drop onto pool—showing that the
normalized bubble volume Vb/V drop ∼St4/3. However, for the last conﬁguration, twice as much
volume is entrapped, or half the impact velocity must be used, owing to the two compliant surfaces
arising from the added mass of the pool.

2.5. Skating on a Thin Layer of Air or Contact with the Solid Substrate
One of the interesting questions raised by the above studies is the detailed break of the air layer
when molecular contact is ﬁrst established with the solid substrate. Motivated by the effect of air
pressure on splashing, Mandre et al. (2009) suggested that the drop might slide on a continuous
layer of air and splash without molecular contact. Kolinski et al. (2012) used total internal reﬂection
to support this notion and coined the phrase “skating on a ﬁlm of air.” This technique observes
the gracing light reﬂected from a glass surface, when the angle between the incident light and
glass surface is smaller than a critical angle (48◦for air-glass). However, when the liquid makes
contact with the glass surface, because of the similar refractive index of the glass and liquid, the
reﬂection disappears, and the contacts become clearly marked by dark spots. Some signature is
also observed owing to an evanescent wave, when the air layer becomes a few tens of nanometers,
allowing measurements of the bottom proﬁle of the drop (Kolinski et al. 2014a,b).
Following much debate, this issue can be clariﬁed by the following observations. First, the
contraction of the central disc into the bubble would not occur without a contact line, which must
be present to allow the reduction in surface energy (Thoroddsen et al. 2005). Second, Driscoll &
Nagel (2011) used an optical interference technique to show that for higher impact velocities, the
liquid contact outside the central disk wets the substrate. Their measurements show that if there
were a thin air layer present, it must be less than 3.5 nm thick. Such a layer would of course be highly
unstable by van der Waals interactions. Third, Kolinski et al. (2012) clearly demonstrated that
isolated wetting contacts formed and that increasing the impact velocity causes a larger number of
contacts along the ring bounding the central disc (see also Kolinski et al. 2014a,b; de Ruiter et al.
2015a). One can speculate that even higher velocities will show still more numerous contacts and
a transition to what appears similar to a continuous rupture. The characteristic dark ring marking
the initial contact radius, seen by Thoroddsen & Sakakibara (1998) and Thoroddsen et al. (2005)
and more recently by de Ruiter et al. (2015a), is likely a microbubble signature of this initial
contact. The effects of statistical roughness and isolated asperities remain an open question, as
discussed by Mani et al. (2010) and Mandre & Brenner (2012). Common features of many of the
images of the early contact through glass plates are several isolated contacts (e.g., see Liu et al.
2013). These most likely result from local asperities, which become important when the air-layer
thickness reaches down to dozens of nanometers. This needs to be further studied with glass
substrates that have been well characterized before the impact. These details will not change the
ﬁnal outcome but would give a strong indication of the actual air-layer thickness when it ruptures,
providing hints at the underlying physics, be they hydrodynamic or molecular in nature.
Conversely, for the lowest impact velocities, the drops can indeed glide on a ﬁlm of air and
rebound without contacting the solid substrate, even for hydrophilic surfaces (Kolinski et al.
2014a). This has been studied in great detail by de Ruiter et al. (2015b), who have shown in careful
experiments that skating for a water drop is possible only for V < 0.48 m/s. Over a range of
liquids, this corresponds to a Weber number of We < 4, and the minimum thickness observed is
hmin ≃200 nm. Furthermore, the scaling for hmin derived from the axisymmetric simulations of
Duchemin & Josserand (2011) also shows that for impact velocities, of relevance in splashing, the
thickness becomes subnanometric. One must therefore conclude that air skating under the center
of the drop is irrelevant for the splashing transition, discussed in the next section.
3. LATER DYNAMICS: SPREADING AND REBOUNDING
Later-time dynamics of the impact exhibit different behaviors depending on the impact and
substrate parameters, ranging from smooth spreading to splashing, jetting, and rebound. The

spreading dynamics are an important aspect in many applications, for instance, for inkjet printing
in microelectronics (Minemawari et al. 2011) or in forensic science (Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,
Attinger et al. 2013, Laan et al. 2014). In both cases, the splashing-spreading transition is crucial
for the printing quality or the determination of the link between the blood pattern and drop
trajectories.
3.1. Overall Spreading Dynamics, Rebound, and Jetting
When no splashing is observed, the drop simply spreads over the surface until it reaches a maximum
radius. Then, depending on the surface properties, the liquid can recede or remain close to this
maximum spread (Rioboo et al. 2001). The dynamics are then controlled by subtle balances
between inertia, viscosity, and capillary forces (Bartolo et al. 2005). In particular, when the impact
is performed on a (super)hydrophobic surface, the drop’s retraction can lead to partial or complete
rebound and even to singular jet formation (Renardy et al. 2003, Bartolo et al. 2006b) (Figure 3).
This occurs through convergence of capillary waves at the apex, which can also entrap bubbles
in the drop (Huang et al. 2013). Pittoni et al. (2015) have tracked the various bubble-entrapment
mechanisms.
These retraction, rebound, and jetting dynamics can be controlled by varying the wettability
of the solid surface (Bayer & Megaridis 2006, Yokoi et al. 2009). This is particularly the case when

the impact is performed on a textured surface. Both the spreading dynamics and the retraction
are affected depending whether the liquid penetrates the textured surface (the Wenzel state) or
moves over the structures (the Cassie-Baxter state) (Bartolo et al. 2006b, Kwon et al. 2013, Maitra
et al. 2014). Furthermore, complex rebound and jetting dynamics can be observed when the drop
impacts on an deformable solid surface, such as an elastic membrane (Antkowiak et al. 2011), or
on ﬁbers (Piroird et al. 2009), for instance.
3.2. Maximum/Residual Spreading Radius and Minimal Thickness
An important outcome of a drop impact on a solid substrate is the maximum spreading radius.
This quantity, pertinent in the absence of splash, has applications in inkjet printing (Minemawari
et al. 2011) and forensic science (Hulse-Smith et al. 2005, Attinger et al. 2013), although the
crucial quantity in these cases is the residual spreading radius, which can differ from the maxi-
mum spreading radius. Numerous relations between the maximum spreading radius (or diameter)
and the impact parameters have been established using physical arguments generally based on
the balance between inertia and viscous and capillary contributions (Chandra & Avedisian 1991,
Pasandideh-Fard et al. 1996, Range & Feuillebois 1998, Rioboo et al. 2002, Roisman et al. 2002,
Clanet et al. 2004, Fedorchenko et al. 2005, Ukiwe & Kwok 2005, Roisman 2009, Vadillo et al.
2009, Eggers et al. 2010). It is important to emphasize that all these relations show reasonable
agreement with experiments and numerical simulations despite their quite different formulations.
Indeed, for the ranges of parameters concerned, the spreading radius does not vary by many orders
of magnitude, so power-law scalings are hard to identify, and it is difﬁcult to discriminate between
the different models by quantitative arguments alone. Moreover, no asymptotic relation can be
tested because of the splashing mechanism that occurs for a large impact velocity, although these
relations are often presented in such asymptotic forms. In particular, the initial drop radius is often
neglected, so some of these relations should be corrected by subtracting the initial drop radius.
However, most of these models distinguish two regimes for the spreading factor β, deﬁned by
the ratio between the maximum radius and the initial one:
β = Rmax

The ﬁrst is a viscous regime in which the maximal extension of the drop is obtained using a balance
between the kinetic energy and the viscous dissipation. The spreading factor follows the relation
β −1 ∝Re1/5, often simpliﬁed to
β ∝Re1/5.
The second is an inertial regime in which the spreading factor is determined by a more complex
balance between the inertia and capillary forces with some correction due to viscous dissipation and
wettability effects. Many different models have been proposed in this regime, and their pertinence
remained a question of scientiﬁc debate until recently. A simple scaling analysis comparing the
initial kinetic energy with the surface energy at the maximum spreading radius would suggest an
asymptotic regime valid for large Weber numbers, β ∝We1/2. However, as explained above, the
available Weber numbers for this regime in which no splash is present do not really allow one
to observe such scaling, and more detailed models have included corrections due to the initial
surface energy, contact angle, or viscous dissipation. Clanet et al. (2004) developed an alternative
using a mass conservation argument based on the pancake thickness selected by the capillary wave
created by the impact and leading to the scaling law β ∝We1/4. This scaling law has had great
success as it gives good quantitative agreement with experimental data for hydrophobic substrates,
and it has subsequently been commonly used to ﬁt experimental data. However, we emphasize

that the correction due to the initial radius (typically leading one to consider β −1 instead of
β for the comparison for low Weber numbers) should be considered and would strongly lower
the validity of this scaling. Quantitatively, as mentioned above, all these formulas eventually give
good agreement with experimental and numerical data, so it is hard to discriminate between these
different approaches. Table 1 presents the most commonly used formulas in the literature to ﬁt
the experimental/numerical results.
Recently, dynamical models investigating the time evolution of a thin liquid ﬁlm spreading on
a solid substrate have provided a general framework for impact spreading that correctly describes
the two regimes (viscous and inertial) and gives, in particular, a good understanding of the inertial
regime, reconciling most of the existing models. Yarin & Weiss (1995) ﬁrst proposed the use of
the thin-ﬁlm approximation in the investigation of the spreading dynamics after impact, and it was
then adapted to different situations (Fedorchenko et al. 2005, Roisman 2009, Roisman et al. 2009,
Eggers et al. 2010). A viscous boundary layer correction has recently been considered to the initial
inviscid model, ﬁrst by Roisman et al. (2009) and Roisman (2009) and later in a similar way by
Eggers et al. (2010). The velocity in the spreading lamella can be described as a ﬁrst approximation
by the following inviscid hyperbolic axisymmetric velocity ﬁeld:
vr = r
t
and
vz = −2z
t ,
(3)
which corresponds to a decreasing pressure ﬁeld with time (vr and vz being the radial and vertical
velocities, respectively). Such ﬂow suggests that in this regime, the drop surface [deﬁned by z =
h(r, t)] evolves in a self-similar way:

which has been observed both in numerical simulations (Roisman et al. 2009, Eggers et al. 2010)
and in experiments (Lagubeau et al. 2012) (Figure 4).
However, such Eulerian ﬂow (Equation 3) is not consistent with the no-slip boundary condition
on the substrate, so a time-dependent viscous boundary layer develops from the substrate surface
as the drop spreads. The thickness of this viscous layer obeys the usual scaling laws (lbl ∼√νt),
and accounting for its dynamics allows for a better understanding of the overall drop spreading.
For example, the minimal liquid thickness experienced during the spreading (sometimes called,
by extension, the residual thickness) is as follows:
hmin ∼D Re−2/5,
(5)
as observed numerically and experimentally (see Figure 5a) (Fedorchenko et al. 2005, Roisman
2009, Eggers et al. 2010, Lagubeau et al. 2012).
The spreading radius can be described through the value of an impact parameter Pi = We ·
Re−2/5, following
β = Re1/5 fc(Pi).
(6)
The function fc is expected to behave asymptotically as P1/2
i
for small Pi and as a constant for large
Pi, in agreement with the inertia-capillary and inertia-viscous balance, respectively. Although the
inertia-capillary asymptotic limit cannot be investigated experimentally, this law conﬁrms that
it is the inertia-capillary balance that controls the spreading there (β ∝We1/2) rather than the
alternative one (β ∝We1/4), as shown in Figure 5b, in which experiments with different liquids
show a good collapse for the spreading factor according to Equation 6. Indeed, the latter law
would have suggested another impact parameter P′
i = We · Re−4/5 for which the collapse of the
results is clearly less good (Eggers et al. 2010, Laan et al. 2014, Lastakowski et al. 2014).
3.3. Impact on a Small Target
Impacts on small circular targets, the size of the drop itself, free the spreading lamella from the
viscous no-slip boundary condition at the solid substrate, thus creating conditions closer to the
above inviscid theory. This has been done in experiments by Rozhkov et al. (2010) and Villermaux
& Bossa (2011) focusing on the puncturing of the lamella and fragmentation of its edge. Bakshi et al.

4. SPLASHING: PROMPT VERSUS CORONA SPLASH
4.1. Splashing Threshold
As the impact velocity V is increased, eventually the drop will splash (i.e., break up and eject
smaller pieces). Classically, the splashing threshold was characterized by the so-called splashing
parameter proposed by Stow & Hadﬁeld (1981) and Mundo et al. (1995), which incorporated the
inertia, viscous stress, and surface tension in the form
K = We
√
Re.
(7)
For impacts at K ≳3,000, one can expect a splash. Many variants of the above power laws exist in
the literature (see review in Moreira et al. 2010 and Marengo et al. 2011). Motivated by the early
imaging of Rioboo et al. (2001), the nature of the splash has been split into two categories, prompt
and corona, shown in Figure 1d,e, respectively. A prompt splash releases droplets directly from
the breakup of the tip of the advancing lamella, whereas in the corona splash the intact lamella
rises away from the substrate, forming a bowl-like structure, which subsequently breaks up into
ﬁne droplets. Much effort has been devoted to ﬁnding the critical values of K for various impact
conditions (e.g., Vander Wal et al. 2006, Roisman et al. 2015).
4.2. Inﬂuence of the Surrounding Gas

splashing. This seminal discovery has triggered a renewed decade-long search for the underlying
physics, in particular trying to pin down the role of air and the surface roughness (Tsai et al. 2009,
2010, 2011). As discussed below, many proposals have appeared, but consensus has yet to emerge.
The interplay between the surface roughness and gas pressure complicates the interpretation of
the two splashing types. Xu et al. (2007) devised an ingenious way to study the size distribution of
the ejected droplets by simply surrounding the impact with a circular sheet of paper. The resulting
splatters showed different signatures for the two splashing types, with a thin horizontal line of
spots for the prompt splash and a more vertically spread random distribution for the corona splash.
However, this technique captured only forward-moving droplets and was limited to droplets larger
than 100 µm. Direct imaging of the splashed droplets in the prompt splash regime showed that
the earliest droplets are the smallest and emerge at the highest velocities, with early 5-µm droplets
emerging at close to 90 m/s, or 104 times their terminal velocity (Thoroddsen et al. 2012) (see
Supplemental Video 1). They are therefore rapidly decelerated by air drag and can easily become
airborne. These observed droplet sizes support viscous growth of the thickness of the early lamella.
Xu et al. (2007) proposed that the prompt splash is produced by the surface roughness, whereas
the corona splash is created by the air drag at the front of the lamella. This cannot be the whole
story, as prompt microsplashing has been observed by Thoroddsen et al. (2012) for an impact
on a smooth glass surface. Latka et al. (2012) proposed that perhaps a single mechanism is at
play, simply appearing at different spreading locations. They removed the inﬂuence of the corona
splash by conducting the experiments in a low-pressure helium atmosphere, clearly showing that
a random surface roughness can reduce splashing by reducing the levitated ﬁlm at the edge of the
expanding lamella, while increasing prompt splashing.
Stevens et al. (2014) found an empirical scaling for the splashing boundary on a smooth surface
using low-viscosity liquids over a range of gas pressures. The scaling highlights the importance of
the mean-free path of the gas molecules.
A few studies have looked at splashing on inclined surfaces (Stow & Hadﬁeld 1981) or rapidly
translating surfaces. Chou et al. (2009) showed strong asymmetry and splashing even in the low–
Weber number deposition regime, when the impact angle to the vertical direction exceeds 85◦.
Bird et al. (2009) additionally showed that the corona splash can be suppressed on the lamellar
stretching side for a very large translational velocity of the substrate.
4.3. Levitated Lamella
The drop viscosity dramatically changes the splashing dynamics. For more viscous liquids, the
lamella lifts away from the substrate (Driscoll et al. 2010, Schroll et al. 2010) and starts gliding
on a thin sheet of air (Figure 6a). The forces responsible for the levitation of the sheet must arise
from the dynamics around the rapidly moving contact line. Lubrication in the air under the sheet
requires a large advancing contact angle, whereas suction in the airﬂow over the top is an inertial
process. Bischofberger et al. (2013) introduced glycerin vapor into the air, forming spectacular
Schlieren images (Figure 6c), to identify vortices forming above the leading edge of the lamella.
Thoroddsen et al. (2010) showed that this levitated lamella can become unstable and can touch
the solid surface ahead of the contact line, thus not only entrapping a myriad of air bubbles
when these localized contacts meet the expanding contact line (Figure 6d ), but also rupturing
the levitated lamella, producing a powerful capillary-driven splash. This bubble entrapment was
studied in more detail by Driscoll et al. (2010) and Palacios et al. (2012), who observed multiple
rings of microbubbles. The earliest breakup of the lamellar edge may be assisted by capillary
instability in the cusp in the neck at which the lamella connects to the drop (Figure 6b and
Supplemental Video 2) or by sawtooth instability at the contact line (Rein & Delplanque 2008).

Stevens et al. (2014) proposed that the delayed emergence of the thinner levitated jet from the
tip of the lamella is a generic mechanism, occurring even for low-viscosity impacts. They quantiﬁed
this time delay as a function of viscosity and air pressure. For the prompt splash, the ﬁrst appearance
of the lamella is thus emerging as a fundamental quantity, followed by the separation of its tip
from the solid surface. However, immediately following the ﬁrst wetting contact, the emergence
of the lamella is controlled by the geometry of the drop, and it can splash instantaneously for low
viscosities (e.g., see Thoroddsen et al. 2012 in which the droplet is shown to emerge immediately
at a local tangential velocity to the lamellar tip motion). This was earlier studied by Mongruel
et al. (2009) using multiple-strobe imaging and most recently by Riboux & Gordillo (2015).
4.4. Recent Theories
Riboux & Gordillo (2014) formulated a new splashing theory incorporating in part similar ideas for
an impact on a smooth, partially wetting surface. They scaled the radial growth of the normalized
wetted area as r =
√
3t, with ﬂuid elements ejected at velocity vr =
	
3/t. They proposed that the
liftoff of the lamella has two contributions: the lubrication force of the air upstream of the contact
line (arising a priori for a dynamic contact angle >90◦) and the suction force due to the ﬂow
over the edge (given the Bernoulli inviscid mechanism there). The lubrication part depends on
the contact angle and the mean-free path of the gas molecules, as already suggested in theoretical
models involving noncontinuum gas correction (Duchemin & Josserand 2012, Mandre & Brenner

2012). Balancing the rising velocity of the tip of the ejecta with the capillary retraction Taylor-
Culick velocity gives a splashing threshold that compares well with extensive data from Palacios
et al. (2013), as well as with the reduced-pressure data from Xu et al. (2005), but does not include
the inﬂuence of the surface wettability or roughness.
Liu et al. (2015) showed that a strategically placed ring of 75 µm through holes in the substrate
can suppress splashing, whereas closed pits do not. This ﬁnding suggests that one needs to drain the
air layer from under the outer edge to stabilize it. They proposed a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
at the interface between the thin air layer and the bottom of the drop as being responsible for
the splashing, but they lacked direct imaging of the proposed instability. Lembach et al. (2010)
have also shown a higher value for the splashing parameter for impacts on porous substrates.
Alternatively, a splash can be triggered by an isolated protrusion, as shown by Josserand et al.
(2005), or a pit, as shown by de Jong et al. (2015). Kim et al. (2014) tested impacts on various
closed-pit morphologies, also invoking a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to explain the lower critical
values of the splashing parameter for larger pit areas.
Therefore, one can conclude that including the gas pressure in the splashing threshold must
give rise to different scaling laws, as this effect is absent in the conventional splash parameter
(Equation 7). In particular, varying the ambient gas pressure leads to a threshold such that the
splashing is apparently enhanced by the gas viscosity (Stevens 2014, Stevens et al. 2014), sug-
gesting that an overall criterion including all the parameters is still missing. This is also the
conclusion of the recent work by Roisman et al. (2015) regarding critical values for the splash-
ing parameter K (Equation 7). In particular, one should note that the incompressible lubrica-
tion equation for the gas cannot be enough to model the gas inﬂuence as it would involve
only the Stokes number, which is independent from the gas pressure because of the Maxwell
law (only the dynamical viscosity of the gas enters into the Stokes number). Thus, additional
physical mechanisms, such as gas compressibility, inertia, and noncontinuum effects, have to be
considered.
Finally, the above studies also highlight the difﬁculty in distinguishing between the prompt and
corona splash, as exempliﬁed by Riboux & Gordillo (2014), who showed that the separated lamella
can stabilize by reattaching to the substrate. In fact, the splashing threshold based on the splashing
parameter K (Equation 7) has been established without discriminating between the prompt and
corona splash. Thus, an up-to-date parametric study separating these two dynamics is needed.
4.5. Fingering
The splat left behind after impact has a familiar ﬁngering pattern (see Figure 7). The early work of
Allen (1975) attributed the ﬁngers to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the decelerating edge of the
lamella, which has also been suggested by recent linear stability analysis of a liquid rim (Roisman
et al. 2006, Agbaglah et al. 2013). However, clear ﬁngering instability was observed from the very
start of lamellar formation by Thoroddsen & Sakakibara (1998), who also showed that ﬁngers can
split and merge during spreading. Marmanis & Thoroddsen (1996) dropped colored liquids onto
thick cotton paper, demonstrating that the number of ﬁngers N scales with a modiﬁed impact
Reynolds number N ∝(Re1/2
D We1/4)3/4. Aziz & Chandra (2000) proposed a different formula
N = Re1/4We1/2/
√
48 for molten droplets. Mehdizadeh et al. (2004) extended these measurements
to much higher impact velocities (∼50 m/s) using a surface moving on a ﬂywheel, which whacks
the drop in ﬂight. They showed reasonable scaling with the Weber number, N = 1.14We1/2,
ignoring liquid viscosity. In the robust splashing regime, it becomes challenging to determine
the number of ﬁngers, as is clearly shown in the snapshots in Figure 7b. The same technique
was used by Fassmann et al. (2013) to study the sizes of splashed droplets. Visser et al. (2012)

achieved even higher impact velocities (∼100 m/s) of microdrops by exploiting laser-produced
jetting (Thoroddsen et al. 2009). Impacts at huge Reynolds numbers have been studied by using
larger liquid masses released from punctured balloons, but unavoidable external disturbances can
obscure the impact-induced ﬁngering (Yoon et al. 2007).
Blood-splatter analysis can be instrumental in forensic sciences (see Hulse-Smith et al. 2005,
Laan et al. 2014). The combination of the diameter and number of ﬁngers of the dried spatter can
help pin down the droplet size and trajectory (see Attinger et al. 2013).
The splashing pattern itself obviously depends on the surface properties. At ﬁrst, the wettability
of the substrate is crucial for the splashing and breakup of the edge. The larger the contact angle,
the easier is the splashing (Yokoi 2011) (Figure 8). Whereas the corona splash exhibits a typical
S-shape ejecting small droplets, the skating thin ﬁlm leads to the formation of ﬁngers as shown in
Figure 8.
5. THE EFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE PROPERTIES
Above we focus on impacts on ﬂat dry surfaces. Allowing modiﬁcation of the substrate opens
up uncountable variants. The surface can be porous or compliant (Pepper et al. 2008, Gilet &
Bourouiba 2014); one can add patterned roughness elements, penetrating holes, closed pits, or
spatially varying wettability. Such modiﬁcations are a particularly active area of study, given the
myriad of potential applications, from self-cleaning surfaces to enhanced heat transfer during
spray cooling or anti-icing of airplane wings. This effort is aided by the rapid development of new
micro- and nanofabrication techniques.

Motivated by the lotus leaf, superhydrophobic surfaces (i.e., hydrophobic and microstructured)
have been engineered using various pillar arrangements to make an impacting fakir drop bounce
with a restitution coefﬁcient as high as 0.9 (Richard & Qu´er´e 2000). In early studies, Reyssat et al.
(2006) and Bartolo et al. (2006a) systematically varied the pillar height h and spacing ℓto ﬁnd the
critical impact velocity V ∗between the drop fully bouncing or partly wetting the surface (i.e., tran-
sitions from full to partial repellency). This transition occurs when the impact energy is sufﬁcient
to stretch the curved free meniscus between the pillars until they touch the substrate, giving
V ∗=
	
δh /ρℓ2.
However, for even the most repellent surfaces at sufﬁciently high impact velocities, the spread-
ing edge of the lamella will break up, and only part of the drop can rebound. van der Veen et al.
(2014) used color interferometry to measure the shape of the meniscus between such pillars. Most
recently, Antonini et al. (2014) applied X-rays to directly image the meniscus to pin down this
wetting transition. Recent mushroom-shaped, double-reentrant, superomniphobic surfaces show
bouncing of fully wettable liquids, such as hexadecane (Tuteja et al. 2008) and even perﬂuorohex-
ane (Liu & Kim 2014).
Richard et al. (2002) demonstrated that the contact time of a drop impacting a smooth hy-
drophobic surface is almost constant, independent of the impact velocity, but grows linearly with
drop size. Bird et al. (2013) showed that this time can be reduced by a cleverly constructed pattern-
ing of a superhydrophobic surface, which breaks the drop into smaller pieces. They suggested that
some leaves and butterﬂy wings have developed such patterns. Moevius et al. (2014) demonstrated
what they call a pancake rebound (Figure 9b). This occurs when the impacting drop spreads along
the texture but subsequently rebounds away from it before it can retract, thus retaining the ﬂat-
tened shape when the liquid leaves the surface. This has the possible advantage of further reducing
the contact time of the drop with the substrate, which can be important in certain applications,
such as anti-icing coatings. Coatings are also used to reduce bug-splatter remnants on windshields
and airplane wings, on which impacts are usually at an angle (Yeong et al. 2014).
The next level of surface complexity involves modiﬁcations to promote directional rebounding,
such as splitting the liquid into patterns or segmenting it onto wettable strips. Lee et al. (2010)
studied impacts on a wettability-patterned surface, consisting of hydrophobized radial spikes,
emanating from the center of the impact location (Figure 9c). They successfully formed ﬁne
radial ﬁngers at wavelengths different from the natural instability. Surprisingly, regular liquid
patterns can be formed for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic line patterns, with the liquid resting
on and in between the patterns, respectively. Reyssat et al. (2009) showed that variations of the

postspacing along the surface can move the drops sideways. The impacting drops can also be
formed into wetting patterns or can be redirected during the rebound (Schutzius et al. 2014).
Solid substrates can be porous or have isolated holes. Lorenceau & Qu´er´e (2003) impacted
a drop on a plate with a hole, identifying the critical We as function of Re, for which some
of the liquid is ejected through the hole. Brunet et al. (2009) impacted a drop onto a regular
microgrid, with holes in the form of truncated pyramids. The impact pushes through regular
microdroplets with sizes similar to the individual hole size (Figure 9a). They demonstrated a
larger critical We if the plate was turned over to form a reentrant surface structure. Similarly, Sahu
et al. (2015) used porous mats of nanoﬁbers, which have applications in heat exchangers. They saw
ﬁne jets emerging through the bottom of the mat, about three times faster than the drop impact
velocity.

5.1. Phase Change During Impact
For certain applications, it is desired that the drop go through a phase change during impact. This
can be solidiﬁcation of a molten drop in soldering, or boiling of a drop during fuel-spray/wall
interactions (Moreira et al. 2010), and in extreme spray cooling of electronic devices. Solidiﬁca-
tion is fundamental during inkjet soldering of electronics or fabrication of displays (Shinoda et al.
2009). Bhola & Chandra (1999) studied the solidiﬁcation of parafﬁn wax, identifying the impor-
tant parameters controlling the process. Aziz & Chandra (2000) examined the solidiﬁcation and
splashing of molten metal droplets, deﬁning a solidiﬁcation parameter and characterizing when
solidiﬁcation will not affect spreading.
Spray cooling can be most effective when it extracts heat into energy of vaporization of the
spray droplets. Leidenfrost effects (Qu´er´e 2013) are thus important, as they reduce heat transfer
and enhance bouncing away from the substrate (Ko & Chung 1996). Biance et al. (2006) showed
that Leidenfrost drops bounce with restitution coefﬁcients exceeding unity, thus extracting energy
from the vaporization. Antonini et al. (2013) demonstrated rebound due to the sublimation of a
dry-ice substrate.
Moita & Moreira (2007) and Moreira et al. (2007) studied oils and petrochemicals fuels, show-
ing jetting in the nucleate boiling regime. Breakup of the Leidenfrost layer under the drop has
been studied by Tran et al. (2012) using interferometry. They identiﬁed explosive vertical jetting
through the spreading lamella and characterized the splashing for heated surfaces, encompassing
the Leidenfrost regime. Fingering of radial vapor lines during impact boiling was also observed
in total internal reﬂection images under the drop, at temperatures slightly under the Leidenfrost
point (Figure 7d) (Khavari et al. 2015).
5.2. Splashing of Composite Drops
Liquid suspensions and emulsions are ubiquitous in chemical processing and often form droplets.
The impact of such droplets is thus of interest, for example, in spray cooling, lubrication, and
combustion. Prunet-Foch et al. (1998) studied coolant/lubricant oil-water emulsions, sprayed on
cold-rolling mills used in steel strip manufacturing. The impacts showed ﬁne jetting, attributed
to oil droplets ejected out of the free surface. Figure 10 shows the impact of a drop containing
large, heavier, internal perﬂuorohexane droplets, which settle near the bottom of the main drop.
This forms isolated jets as the impact pressure ﬁeld is focused around the internal smaller droplets,
showing the importance of the number and location of the inner droplets. Counterjets have been
observed during the impact of hollow drops (Gulyaev & Solonenko 2013).
The impact of dense suspensions of small solid particles has been imaged by Marston
et al. (2013), showing grains ejected at twice the impact velocity of the granular drop. Pe-
ters et al. (2013) demonstrated that one should use a particle-based Weber number to predict
the onset of splashing. Interestingly, for bimodal particles, the smaller ones are more readily
ejected. Splashing of non-Newtonian liquids has thus far not been well studied (Guemas et al.
2009).
Naturally, research into the complex phenomenon of drop impact, focused ﬁrst on the simplest
conﬁgurations, has now shifted to fully attack the complexity of surface structure, complex-liquid
drops, etc. Below are some of the issues that we believe need to be tackled. With accelerating
improvements in both high-speed sensor technology and computational power, we expect the
coming decade to provide even more breakthroughs in the study of drop impact, than have already
occurred in the last decade since the review of Yarin (2006).

FUTURE ISSUES
1. Following the seminal discovery of Xu et al. (2005) that splashing is suppressed by re-
duced air pressure, many groups have tried to ﬁnd the underlying mechanism. Numerous
proposals have recently been put forth, some of which could be correct. The main focus is
now on the levitation of the tip of the lamella as it travels along the substrate (Latka et al.
2012, Stevens et al. 2014, Riboux & Gordillo 2014, Liu et al. 2015). Improved imaging
should pinpoint the most promising explanations for the different impact conditions to
show whether a single uniﬁed splashing theory exists.
2. One uncertainty in this regard is the fuzzy deﬁnition of the splashing boundary, especially
in the presence of surface roughness. Random roughness will inherently give random
results, making it nontrivial to determine the splashing limit (e.g., see the large overlap
of the splashing and deposition regimes observed in Roisman et al. 2015). High-speed
microsplashing may also have been overlooked by early researchers (Thoroddsen et al.
2012). Furthermore, drops larger than the capillary length are easily deformed from the
spherical shape, and air drag in free fall can ﬂatten them. This invariable affects impact
outcomes (Thoroddsen et al. 2005, Mishra et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2013) but was not
characterized in many earlier studies.
3. Finding and predicting the splashing threshold are worthwhile quests in and of them-
selves. However, of greater practical importance will be to fully characterize the resulting
splash. The size and number of the ﬁnest droplets are important, for example, for the gen-
eration of aerosols. Trajectories of droplets are important for the uniformity of coatings,
contamination, or rain erosion.

4. Most experiments study only drop silhouettes, and numerics assume axisymmetry. Per-
haps some instabilities reside in the ﬂow ﬁeld inside the drop, as has recently been shown
numerically by Thoraval et al. (2012) for the drop-pool ejecta sheet. This poses fresh
experimental challenges, which may be overcome in the near future.
5. The overwhelming majority of impact studies are far away from supersonic conditions
(Lesser & Field 1983, Haller et al. 2002). However, such impacts can arise in applications
such as sprays from high-pressure fuel injectors. Shock waves and the water-hammer
pressure give rise to new dynamics. Direct measurements of the very large local forces
involved might be possible with microscopic sensors. Overall forces can be measured
using ﬂexible glass substrates (Soto et al. 2014).
6. Practically, most impacts are oblique to the surface. This conﬁguration deserves more
attention.
7. Repeated drop impacts quickly wet the surface and transform the dynamics to impacts
on liquid ﬁlms, a topic not covered above, but even very thin ﬁlms can have a strong
effect on impact outcomes.
