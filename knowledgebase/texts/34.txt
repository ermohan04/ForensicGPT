This comparative review highlights the relationships between the disciplines of bloodstain pattern
analysis (BPA) in forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences. In both the BPA and FD
communities, scientists study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air, or with other
liquids or solids. Five aspects of BPA related to FD are discussed: the physical forces driving the motion of
blood as a ﬂuid; the generation of the drops; their ﬂight in the air; their impact on solid or liquid surfaces;
and the production of stains. For each of these topics, the relevant literature from the BPA community
and from the FD community is reviewed. Comments are provided on opportunities for joint BPA and FD
research, and on the development of novel FD-based tools and methods for BPA. Also, the use of
dimensionless numbers is proposed to inform BPA analyses.

1. Introduction
While the disciplines of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) in
forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) each have a rich history
[1,2], interactions between these communities have not always
been strong. From its infancy in 19th century Germany, BPA has
aimed for practical answers to speciﬁc questions of the kind: ‘‘How
did the bloodletting event of Fig. 1 happen?’’ FD was born in the
17th and 18th centuries, in England, Switzerland and France. In
contrast to BPA, FD aims to quantitatively describe the motion of
ﬂuids (gases or liquids), and the causes of the motion, with general
equations. FD typically deﬁnes the initial and boundary conditions
of a ﬂuid system, and from there describes how the system evolves
in time and space, most often in a deterministic manner. BPA
typically solves the indirect problem of inspecting stains in a crime
scene to infer the most probable bloodletting event that produced
these patterns. In both the BPA and FD communities, scientists
study the motion and phase change of a liquid in contact with air,
or with other liquids or solids. The need for better integrating FD
and BPA is mentioned in a 2009 report [3] by the US National
Research Council, entitled ‘‘Strengthening Forensic Science in the
United States: A Path Forward’’. The report mentions that ‘‘the
uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are
enormous’’, states that a minimum requirement to make BPA
interpretations is to have ‘‘an understanding of the physics of ﬂuid
transfer’’, and advocates for stronger scientiﬁc foundations for BPA,
given ‘‘the complex nature of ﬂuid dynamics’’. It is our conviction
that the FD and BPA communities could beneﬁt from a deeper
understanding of each other. Speciﬁcally, by following the path
proposed by the US National Academies, BPA can obtain new
quantitative tools and methods, while FD may be presented with
new ﬂow problems.
Note that there are two overlapping communities in BPA: the
users and the researchers. BPA researchers, the speciﬁc target of
this review, evaluate existing BPA techniques, for example for
accuracy; they also develop new BPA techniques. Their research is
typically funded by Governmental Agencies, run in Government
laboratories or in universities and published in journals such as
Forensic Science International or the Journal of Forensic Sciences of
the AAFS (American Academy of Forensic Sciences).Users of BPA
techniques study speciﬁc crime scenes, funded by the Police
Administration or when hired as trial consultants. Articles with
direct practical relevance, targeting users, are typically published
by the International Association for Bloodstain Pattern Analysis
(IABPA) Journal or the Journal of Forensic Identiﬁcation of the
International Association for Identiﬁcation (IAI). A better integra-
tion of FD and BPA might provide better, or simpler tools for BPA
users. Also, some of the ideas in the manuscript may be useful to
instructors for either identifying science topics useful for educa-
tion of future practitioners or for contributing to the continual
education of practitioners interested in introducing more scientiﬁc
approaches into their work.
This review is organized in ﬁve parts. First, Section 2 describes
the physical forces driving the dynamics – the motion and its causes
- of blood as a ﬂuid. Then, the formation of bloodstains is described
as a deterministic sequence of events, in separate sections on (3)
drop generation, (4) drop trajectories, (5) drop impact, and (6) stain
formation.
For each of the ﬁve topics listed above, a summary and
comparative review of relevant literature is presented, ﬁrst the BPA
literature, and then the FD literature. The purpose of this
manuscript is to describe the FD themes and research topics that
affect BPA. It is not intended to be a review of each individual ﬁeld,
but a comparative review of the overlapping areas to facilitate
identiﬁcation of potential inter-community collaborations. For
instance, a synthesis of the connections between FD and BPA is
proposed in Section 7, describing how well the problems are
understood and what opportunities exist for new research and the
development of novel tools and methods. The ﬁndings of our
review paper are then summarized in Table 4, which highlights the
relations between BPA terminology (rows of the table) and FD
concepts (columns). It is our hope that this manuscript will be used
to assess the state-of-the-art and to identify untapped research
topics at the intersections of FD and BPA.
Fig. 1. BPA uses FD-based methods to reconstruct a bloodletting event. In the above crime scene investigated by one of the co-authors, C.M., various bloodstain patterns are
visible, namely a pool (AE), transfer stains (AB), ﬂow patterns (AA) and several drip stains (AD). Elliptical bloodstains (B) indicate the area of origin of a blood spatter, see
Section 5. For an interpretation of what happened in the photographed crime scene, refer to Section 8.

2. Physical forces at play in bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA)
2.1. Description in the BPA literature
Several classic BPA textbooks [1,4,5] include a comprehensive
section on the biological and physical properties of blood,
describing this complex ﬂuid and its main physical properties,
such as density, viscosity and surface tension. Typical values of
these properties are provided in Table 1. Generally deﬁned, blood is
an aqueous liquid, with about half of its volume consisting of
micrometer-size particles such as red and white blood cells. An
indicator of the concentration of particles in the blood is the
hematocrit, which is the measurement of the relative volume of
red blood cells versus the total blood volume [1]. The density of
blood, its mass per volume, 1060 kg/m3, is close to that of water.
The same textbooks also describe how the porosity, roughness and
wettability of a blood-stained surface, called the target surface,
inﬂuence the observed stains. Viscosity is typically presented as a
measure of the resistance of a ﬂuid to a change of shape or ﬂow [5].
The viscosity of blood at body temperature is reported as
approximately 
four 
times 
larger 
than 
that 
of 
water 
[5];
the viscosity of blood decreases with increasing temperature [5]
and increases with increasing hematocrit [6]. Blood is also
described as non-Newtonian ﬂuid, i.e. a ﬂuid with a viscosity that
varies with the ﬂow conditions [5].
Surface tension, also referred to as the surface energy, is the
measure of the energy to change the interfacial area between two
immiscible ﬂuids, here blood and air. Surface tension plays a key
role in the generation of drops and their impact on surfaces.
Surface tension decreases with increasing temperature and is
affected by chemicals present within the blood [7].
Often, BPA work reports measurements of velocities, drop
sizes or stain sizes corresponding to a speciﬁc experiment [8,9],
without attempt to generalize the conclusions to other experi-
mental conditions. Sometimes empirical correlations are ﬁtted
to a set of BPA data [10–12] with little consideration for the
physical basis of these correlations or for their domain of
validity. These approaches might induce conceptual errors and
possibly could be replaced by a physical and dimensionless
description, as in [13,14], to compare the relative importance of
the physical forces. These ideas are discussed in more details
below.

2.2. Fluid dynamics description
In FD, a ﬂuid is characterized in contrast to a solid, and with
respect to some physical properties. What deﬁnes a liquid versus a
solid is the deformation in response to stresses like shear or
elongation: solids respond to stresses by a sudden deformation,
until a new equilibrium conﬁguration is reached, while ﬂuids
continually deform as long as a shear stress is applied. Within FD,
the viscosity is deﬁned as the ratio between applied stress and the
rate of ﬂuid deformation: the higher the viscosity, the higher the
stresses needed for the same ﬂuid deformation (or ﬂow). Viscosity
dissipates the energy associated with the deformation of a ﬂuid. In
relation to BPA, viscosity dampens the shape oscillations of drops
in ﬂight and resists the spreading during impact. The viscosity of
liquids typically decreases with increasing temperature.
For complex liquids such as blood, which contain suspended
particles, the viscosity changes with the shear rate (see Table 1 for
values of shear rates representative of BPA). Such a ﬂuid with a
non-constant relation between stress and rate of deformation is
called non-Newtonian. Blood is further classiﬁed as shear-thinning,
a speciﬁc class of non-Newtonian ﬂuids for which viscosity
decreases with increased shear. Indeed, blood appears more
viscous when it drips from a wound than when it impacts a target
at several meter/second. The viscosity of the blood also increases
with increasing hematocrit and decreasing temperature. The
viscosity m of blood can be modeled from experiments in the
form [16] of m = mrefg(H)f(g)k(T), where mref is the viscosity at a
reference level of temperature (typically 37 8C); and the respective
functions g, f and k model the dependence on hematocrit, shear
rate and temperature, respectively. Other models do exist, such as
that given in [22], to describe the measured viscosity of human
blood for shear rates from 2/s to 100,000/s.
Surface tension is a force over a length, or an energy per unit
area, that characterize any interface between two materials of
different physico-chemical structure, such as blood and air. Surface
tension affects the drop formation process, the breakup of jets [23]
and the oscillations of the shapes of drops. Surface tension tends to
keep the drops spherical in ﬂight since spherical shapes minimize
the surface energy [24]. This tendency of drops to assume a
spherical shape is important to BPA, especially in relation with the
determination of impact angles from the ellipticity of stains.
Regarding the target substrate, the important physical proper-
ties are the elasticity, permeability, porosity, roughness and
wetting angle. The elasticity E of a target is the ratio of the
applied normal force per area to the resulting relative deformation of
the solid surface, called the strain. For example, microscopic
deformations of a rubber target during drop impact have been
shown to inﬂuence the splashing of the drop [25]. The permeability
is related to the ability of a liquid to ﬂow through a porous target. The
porosity is a measure of the typical pore space available for a ﬂuid
[21]. The roughness is a representative measurement of the
departure of the surface texture from an absolute ﬂatness; it is
commonly expressed as Ra, the arithmetic average of that departure.
The wettability describes how a solid target inﬂuences the motion of
a pair of immiscible ﬂuids along it [26], for example water/air or
water/oil. In BPA, wettability inﬂuences the stain size and their
drying. In the case of BPA, the system of interest involves the two
ﬂuids of blood and air, as well as a solid target. The wettability of a
system is illustrated in Fig. 2, and depends on the system chemistry,
physical state (cold or hot) and target microstructure or roughness. It
is characterized by the wetting angle measured at the edge (also
called the wetting or contact line) of a small drop on top of the target,
referred to as the static wetting angle. A small wetting angle (u  08)
corresponds to a hydrophilic state, while a large wetting angle
(u > 1208) correspond to a hydrophobic state, as the liquid tends to
be repelled from the substrate. Note that the wetting angle
dynamically adjusts its value when the wetting line moves, for
example during impact or evaporation [27].
Dimensionless numbers
The discipline of FD describes the motion of gases in extra-
terrestrial space [28], the dynamics of atmospheres and oceans,
and the motion of blood in capillaries thinner than a human hair
[29]. To describe within a single framework events that span such a
large range of time and length scales, FD relies on a three-step
analysis: ﬁrst, the magnitude of all the forces acting on the ﬂuid are
evaluated, as in Table 2; then the relative magnitude of pairs of
these forces is compared using scaling or dimensionless numbers,
such as the ones listed in Table 2, for example the Reynolds or
Weber number; ﬁnally a more detailed analysis is performed based
only on the most relevant forces, neglecting those that are
comparatively negligible. FD methods for detailed analysis include
various analytical methods (solving FD equations with pen and
paper), numerical methods (solving FD equations with a comput-
er), or experimental methods (for example high-speed visualiza-
tion). On one hand, detailed FD analyses provide accurate
solutions, but can be cumbersome and mathematically challeng-
ing. On the other hand, proper use of dimensionless numbers result
in simpler analyses valid for a wide range of experimental
conditions, allowing experimental outcomes (stain dimension,
number of spines, splashing versus no splashing) to be inferred
for cases that have not been (or can not be) tested explicitly. In
other words, the ﬂuid dynamicist knows that two liquids
behave similarly as long as they are in the same physical regime,
i.e. as long as they are experiencing the same ratios of forces.
Therefore, what inﬂuences BPA events is not so much the
physical properties of the blood, air and target, or the velocities
of the bloodletting event, but rather the balance between the
forces at play, expressed with dimensionless numbers. Indeed,
these Reynolds and Weber numbers are not a way to express
practical 
data 
(such 
as 
velocities 
or 
length) 
in 
a 
more
complicated way, but they help answer practical questions.
Sections a-c below illustrate the importance of dimensionless
numbers with the elementary BPA problem of determining the
impact velocity v of a drop with diameter d moving downwards
towards a target.
(a) A dimensionless curve replaces multiple dimensional
curves: Let us start with the simplest experiments where a drop
from a dropper drips towards the ground. Let us control the height
h of the fall and measure the duration t of the fall with a
chronometer or with a high-speed camera. Like Galileo [30,31],
we ﬁnd, at least for moderate heights, that h is proportional to t2,
Fig. 2. Wetting angle u on a hydrophobic target (a, such as an oily, plastic or waxed
surface) and on a hydrophilic target (b, such as clean glass). The wetting angle is
measured at the three-phase line, which is the location where the air (A), the liquid
(L) and the solid (S) meet. Drop impact and stain formation depend on wettability.

i.e. h ﬃ t2. Using together the measured values of h (in meter,
noted m) and t (in second, noted s), and the physical principle
that a valid equation needs to have the same units on both sides
of the equal sign, we ﬁnd the equation for the travel of the drop as
h = 1/2gt2, where we have identiﬁed in g the gravity constant
with units of, necessarily, m/s2. We might then realize that a drop
that falls from higher than one meter typically takes more time
than predicted by the equation h = 1/2gt2. The culprit for slowing
down the drop is the drag, the resistance force exerted by the air
on the moving drop. Fig. 3a shows values of the drag force on
spherical drops moving through air, as a function of their
velocities and diameters. The drops have various diameters,
representative of BPA situations. For low velocities and small
drops, the relation is a straight line because the drag force is
proportional to v; for larger and faster drops, the relation
becomes a parabolic curve indicating that drag forces become
proportional to v2. The transition between these two behaviors
(proportional to v and then to v2) occurs at different velocities for
different droplet sizes.
In contrast, Fig. 3b describes the same relationship between drag
and velocity in a dimensionless way, and all the results of Fig. 3a
collapse along a single curve. To do so, the drag force is reported as
the drag coefﬁcient (CD, deﬁned as in Eq. (2) and (3) below) and
plotted against the Reynolds number (deﬁned in Table 2). The
information conveyed with the dimensionless plot in Fig. 3b is the
very same as in the dimensional plot of Fig. 3a, except that one
dimensionless curve replaces several dimensional curves.
(b) A dimensionless plot tells more about the physics at play
than multiple dimensional plots: In the dimensionless plot of
Fig. 3, the transition between a linear and parabolic relationship
between the drag coefﬁcient and the velocity v corresponds to the
transition between the region where CD decreases with Re, and the
region where CD is constant with Re. This transition occurs over a
well determined range of Reynolds number, corresponding to a
change of physical regime, i.e. a change in the respective
importance of inertial and viscous forces (Table 2): at low Re
the ﬂow is steady and drag is mostly caused by friction forces,
corresponding to a linear dependence between CD and Re, while at
Re higher than 100 unsteadiness and turbulence develop, as
exempliﬁed by the pictures of the ﬂow at Re > 104. This chaotic
motion of the air around the droplet corresponds to inertial forces
being the main cause of the drag, overcoming viscous forces, and
results in a parabolic relationship between CD and Re. The ability to
see the transitions between dominant forces comes with the use of
dimensionless numbers in FD.
An illustrative example of the advantages a and b of using
dimensionless numbers in BPA is provided by the impact velocity
map elaborated in Fig. 4. This map provides the impact velocity
(expressed by the contours of ratios of impact velocity to terminal
velocity) of a drop striking a target, as a function of the initial
release conditions (i.e. initial drop diameter d0 and initial velocity
v0). For simplicity in Fig. 4, v0 is oriented downwards, and the target
is placed horizontally, one meter below the release location. The
initial conditions in Fig. 4 are representative of various conditions
encountered in BPA, with 103 mm  d0  5 mm and 0.1 m/
s  v0  240 m/s.
In this situation of a drop ﬂying towards a target, only two
forces are active: the weight of the drop, and the drag between the
drop and surrounding air. The motion of the droplet towards its
target can be accurately computed, considering how these two
forces affect its initial velocity and position during the ﬂight.
Mathematically, this motion is described by Newton’s second law:
md
dv
*
dt ¼ md~g  ~FD; 
(1)
where md; d~v=dt;~g and ~FD are the droplet mass, droplet accelera-
tion, gravitational acceleration and drag force, respectively.
The above equation simply means that during the time of its
ﬂight, the velocity of the droplet is modiﬁed by two forces, its
weight and the drag.
The value of the drag force is expressed with the correlation
~FD ¼ raCD
Ad
2
~vv; 
(2)
where ra, Ad, v and ~v are the air density, the cross-sectional area
of the droplet, the velocity magnitude and velocity vector of
the droplet. The dimensionless parameter CD
is the drag
coefﬁcient of a spherical object such as a drop, as plotted in
Fig. 3b. For BPA cases, CD is best expressed by the correlation of
Lavernia et al. [34]:

viscosity of the air, and the droplet velocity and diameter,

respectively. The impact velocities and terminal velocities in Fig. 4
have been integrated with respect to time using Eq. (1), with an
explicit discretization method that was tested for convergence.
In a plot such as Fig. 4, non-dimensional numbers are used in
many ways: ﬁrst the initial velocities (vertical axis) and impact
velocities (contours) are displayed as ratios relative to the terminal
velocity. This allows the presentation of a wide range of velocities
in the same plot, more accurately than if velocities were plotted
dimensionally. Also, the different physical regimes are best
identiﬁed with dimensionless numbers and correspond to speciﬁc
regions indicated by squared numerals in Fig. 4. Let us show now
how these different physical regimes are related to the following
questions, fundamental for BPA studies.
b1. Will the drop break into smaller drops? In ﬂight, breakup
occurs when the aerodynamic force, i.e. the drag of the air on the
droplet, overcomes the surface forces at the droplet-air interface.
In-ﬂight breakup complicates the reconstruction of trajectories.
The larger the drop and the higher the velocity, the higher the
chances that the drop breaks up during its ﬂight. To evaluate the
possibility of breakup more rigorously, the aerodynamic drag force
is compared with the surface force [35]. This comparison is
expressed with the dimensionless Weber number,
We ¼ rav2d
s
; 
(4)
where ra, v, d, and s are the density of air, maximum velocity,
droplet diameter, and surface tension, respectively. Should We be
signiﬁcantly smaller than 1, the droplet travels without breaking
up, because surface tension forces win over drag forces. Should We
be on the order of 1, the droplet will signiﬁcantly deform. At even
larger We, the deformation becomes so severe that the drop
disintegrates into smaller ones, when drag forces overcome surface
forces. While the reasoning above is based on a dimensionless FD
number, experiments are needed to determine the exact value of
the Weber number above which drop breaks up. As shown in
[36,37], breakup typically occurs for We > 13, i.e. in the region
above the thick dotted line in Fig. 4, plotted for values of We = 13
based on the initial drop diameter and velocity. As a result, no
impact velocities are provided above that line, because the
formalism exposed here cannot predict how in-ﬂight break-up
affects the trajectory.
b2. Will gravity forces signiﬁcantly modify the initial
velocity?
The question of the inﬂuence of the gravitational force on the
trajectories is important in BPA. If acceleration due to gravity is
negligible during the droplet’s ﬂight, there is no need to consider
curved trajectories. Gravity forces act all along the trajectory, but
do they signiﬁcantly modify the trajectory? For the speciﬁc case in
Fig. 4, gravity will signiﬁcantly modify the initial velocity if the
work of the gravity along the droplet path, Wg, is signiﬁcant with
respect to the initial kinetic energy of the drop Ek0. This comparison
is expressed as the dimensionless number
G ¼ Wg
Ek0
; 
(5)
and shown in Fig. 4, where a thick solid line delineates the region
G > 0.1. To the left of that line, gravity forces will modify the initial
velocity signiﬁcantly, while to the right of that line, gravity forces
will not modify signiﬁcantly the initial velocity. An exact
expression of G is given in Appendix A.
b3. Will the drag force signiﬁcantly affect the trajectory?
The question of the inﬂuence of the drag force on the
trajectories is important in BPA. If drag is negligible, then ballistic
trajectories can be calculated without accounting for the drag force
–which is a complicated function of the drop velocity, see Eq. (3).
In layman’s terms, the question of interest is ‘‘Will the drag
forces slow down the drop a lot or just a little bit?’’ To answer that
question in FD terms, the work WD of the drag forces along the
entire trajectory needs to be compared with the initial kinetic
energy of the drop, Ek0.
This comparison is expressed by the dimensionless number
D ¼ WD=Ek0
(6)
Should D be signiﬁcant, then the work of drag forces will
modify the initial velocity signiﬁcantly. Should D be negligible,
then the drag forces will not modify signiﬁcantly the initial velocity

path (trajectory) of 1 m. The initial velocity points downwards. Note that both axes

the body of the plot) and the initial velocity are given in a non-dimensional manner,
as ratios over the terminal velocity. The terminal velocity vterminal is the dash-dot
violet curve, with values on the vertical axis, right. The thick lines delineate various
physical regimes, identiﬁed with squared numerals and described in Table 3 and
point 2.2b. Detailed instructions to use the plot are in Appendix B.

along the trajectory. For example, if a cloud of drops is produced
with a given velocity, the larger drops typically travel further away
from the region of origin, because their D value is smaller than that
of the smaller drops. This phenomenon explains why for example
in gunshot spatters the small stains are found closer to the area of
origin.
Due to the change in velocity along the droplet’s path, both WD
and D need to be calculated numerically (with a computer,
according to the full deﬁnition of D in Appendix A). In Fig. 4, a thick
dashed line delineates the region where D > 0.3. The region left
from this curve corresponds to a signiﬁcant slowing down of the
initial drop velocity by the work of the drag forces, while the region
right from the curve correspond to a negligible effect of the drag
forces on the initial drop velocity. Note that the terminal velocity of
a droplet is the velocity at which drag forces and gravity forces are
in balance (the dash-dot violet dash-dot curve in Fig. 4).
b4. Will the drop accelerate or slow down?
This question is best answered by comparing the respective
magnitude of the gravity force and the drag force. This ratio is
expressed with the dimensionless number
G ¼ mg=FD
(7)
In the above expression, the drag force can be analytically
calculated based on the initial velocity from Eq. (2). In Fig. 4, the
black dash dotted line delineates the limit where G  1; above that
line drag forces dominate and the drop slows down; below, gravity
dominates and the drop accelerates. The terminal velocity of a
droplet corresponds to the situation where gravity and drag forces
are in exact balance. It is a function of the droplet diameter and is
indicated by the dash-dot violet curve in Fig. 4.
As a summary, Table 3 lists the following six physical regimes
corresponding to speciﬁc regions in Fig. 4. While Fig. 4 has been
drafted for the pedagogical purpose of showing the use of
dimensionless numbers, similar regime maps might help discrim-
inating situations where gravity and drag forces matter, from
situations where these do not matter. This might be relevant to
the selection of methods to reconstruct the trajectories of blood
drops.
(c) Dimensionless numbers are useful for designing experi-
ments. For instance a large blood drop impacting a target at low
velocity might behave in a similar way as a smaller drop impacting
a target at higher velocity. While the latter experiment might be very
hard to make, the former might be easier to make. The fundamental
reason behind this is that two physical events will behave in a
similar way if the ratios of physical forces are the same, i.e. if the
values of the relevant dimensionless numbers (here, the Reynolds
number as well as other relevant numbers) are matched, see point
(b) above. For more details on the use of dimensionless numbers,
see the discussion on similarity and dimensional analysis by Sedov
and Barenblatt [38,39].
As a summary, the use of dimensionless numbers helps to
(a) replace multiple dimensional plots by a single dimensionless
plot;
(b) determine what physical forces inﬂuence a speciﬁc phenome-
non (here the impact velocity of a drop), and what physical
forces can be neglected; and
(c) design experiments.
3. Drop generation
3.1. Description in the BPA literature
BPA analysts often describe single stains or spatters (group of
stains) with a terminology that indicates the most probable
mechanism of their generation [5]. These terms, with several other
commonly used in BPA, are deﬁned in Table 4a. The terminology is
based mainly on the recognition of typical spatters, in terms of
their spatial distribution, the size distribution and orientation of
their stains (for example converging radially or aligned). Indeed, a
beating causes several individual and clearly visible mm-stains,
while a shooting causes a preponderance of sub-mm overlapping
stains, a pink layering called ‘‘pinking’’ or atomized mist. For
example, the terms drip stain refer to drops that fall when their
weight overcomes capillary forces, while cast-off patterns refer to
spatters of drops generated when acceleration forces overcome
capillary forces. Other spatter terminology hinting at the genera-
tion mechanism include impact pattern, mist pattern, back spatter
pattern, forward spatter pattern, pool, swipe pattern, splash pattern,
bubble ring, projected pattern and expiration pattern. These spatters
of known origin are routinely generated and studied in the
workshops educating the BPA examiners.
Two assumptions have been used in BPA studies to correlate the
size distribution of stains in the spatter to the mechanism that
generated the spatter:
1) the stain size correlates inversely with the momentum or speed
of the generation event [4];
2) the stain size indicates the drop size (see discussion in Section
5.1.2). For instance, [43] mentions that ‘‘The mass of the blood
drop can be estimated approximately by the diameter (width of
the bloodstain) and the density of blood.’’
The direct observation of the dynamic generation of a blood
spatter is challenging, because of the high speeds involved (a
baseball bat swings at more than 30 meter/second [44]) and the
sizes of the objects to monitor (sub-mm drops are produced in a
gunshot spatter). Early attempts of high-speed visualizations in
BPA have been reported in 1939 [42], when the oblique impact of
mm-size drops was recorded with an analog camera at speeds up
to 250 images/second. The report [42] mentions two difﬁculties:
the need for lot of lighting, and the difﬁcult synchronization
between the recording and the event. The more recent video
‘‘Blood in Slow Motion’’ [45] shows recording at 4000 images per
second. The sequences show the formation of blood drops, normal
and oblique impacts on solid surfaces of various roughnesses and
porosities, impacts on liquid blood pools, and the formation of
castoff spatters. With the advent of digital high-speed cameras in
the late 1990s, the issue of synchronization has been mitigated,
and speeds up to 1 million frames per second have been made
possible. For instance, strobe photography and high-speed camera
visualization have been used in BPA for expirated [46] and gunshot
spatters [47,48]. In the latter case, information was gathered on the
complex interaction between the air ﬂow induced by the gunshot
and the ﬂight of the cloud of sub-mm droplets. The best examples
of digital high-speed videos related to BPA are the extensive
studies [48,49] done by Epstein, Laber and Taylor. The related
publicly available dataset [50], which is the source of Figs. 6 and 10,
has brought attention in the BPA community to the complexity of
the associated ﬂuid dynamics phenomena.
3.2. Fluid dynamics description
Fluid dynamicists have a long tradition in studying the
generation and impact of drops for the purpose of technologies
such as fuel atomization, ink-jet printing, additive manufacturing,
painting, agriculture, or for the intellectual pleasure of under-
standing how nature works. These studies involve sketches by da
Vinci [51], Savart [52] and Worthington [53], see Fig. 5A and B.
Drawings by Worthington are the ﬁrst examples of high-speed
visualization of drop impact, and a remarkable testimony of
D. Attinger et al. / Forensic Science International 231 (2013) 375–396 
381


--- PAGE 8 ---

mankind’s creativity. In the late 1800s, Worthington used short
and intense electric sparks to impress his retina and ‘freeze’ the
motion of impacting water and mercury drops. Patching together
several of these sketches taken at different instants of the impact,
he could sketch without camera a sequence of drawings of drops
deforming during impact, achieving a time resolution better than a
millisecond [53,54]. Current commercially available high-speed
cameras can conveniently record continuous movies from events
at frame rates up to 100,000 frames per second [55]. Using similar
principles as Worthington, but faster ﬂashes and sensitive
cameras, FD phenomena have been imaged in research laborato-
ries at frame rates up to one million frames per second [56].
Femtosecond lasers provide even faster illumination, and frame
rates up to one trillion frames per second are even possible [57], as
long as the investigated phenomena are reproducible at these
timescales.
Several other non-intrusive experimental technologies are
applicable to measure the dynamics of drop generation, ﬂight
and impact, in terms of particle size, velocities, temperatures,
composition and their distributions, as reviewed in [58–60]. The
technologies include particle image velocimetry, laser-induced
ﬂuorescence and laser-Doppler methods.
The dynamics of drop generation is also well documented for
the following processes: dripping, sheet breakup and jet breakup.
Dripping occurs when a slowly growing volume of liquid
suspended by capillary forces is detached as a drop by gravity
forces. Inertial and viscous forces typically play a secondary role
because the process is slow. The debate [40,41] in the BPA
community about the existence of a typical or minimum volume of
a blood drop generated by dripping can be resolved as follows: this
volume depends on the balance between gravity and the vertical
projection of the capillary force, rather than simply on the balance
between gravity and surface tension. While surface tension only
depends on the solid and the ﬂuids in contact, the vertical
projection of the capillary force depends also on the wetted
diameter and wetting angle (see Table 2), i.e. on the shape and
material of the object from which the drop drips. Therefore,
dripping drops with a wide range of volumes can be generated by
changing, for example, the diameter or material of a pipette, as
already mentioned in the French version of the early BPA work of
Balthazard et al. [42].
The dripping phenomenon is well understood [61,62] in terms
of kinematics [63], frequency, drop volume and ‘‘pinch-off length’’,
which is the distance where a drop separates itself from its source.
Viscosity inﬂuences the dripping process of Newtonian [64] and
non-Newtonian ﬂuids [65]. If the ﬂow rate that causes the initial
volume of liquid becomes faster, inertial forces come into play (as
indicated by non-negligible Weber numbers). Inertial effects affect
the drop size, the formation of smaller ‘‘satellite’’ drops [66]. At
even faster ﬂow rates dripping transitions towards jetting, when
the Weber number reaches a critical value [67]. Also, dripping and
jet breakup induce longitudinal oscillations in the generated drops
[68,69]. The frequency of these oscillations is controlled by surface
tension and the mass of the drop [70], and viscous forces tend to
dissipate these oscillations.
Sheet breakup: In several situations relevant to BPA, the blood
spatter originates from a liquid sheet that subsequently experi-
ences several topological changes until it breaks into drops.
Complex instability mechanisms drive these topology changes,
from sheet to jets, and from jets to drops as shown in Fig. 6. These
topology changes are important, because they indicate that there is
no such thing as a single ‘‘point’’ of origin of a blood spatter. Sheet
breakup has been studied in relation to commercial nozzle and
spray generation processes, as reviewed by Lefebvre [71], and also
in relation to its occurrence during drop impact (see Section 5.2
and [72]). The breakup of a sheet involves a cascade of events, such
as (1) the thickening of the forward edge of the sheet into a
cylindrical rim, due to the tendency of interfaces to assume a
spatially-uniform curvature, forming either plain cylinders or
spherical drops; (2) transverse instabilities on the rim, leading to
cusps and ﬁnger-like jets; and (3) longitudinal instabilities along
the rim, such as the Rayleigh-Plateau [24] instability that break the
jets into drops, as in Fig. 6d.
Sheet breakup is more complex than dripping. The time for the
sheet to breakup can be estimated using linear stability theory
[76,77]. Also, experiments and ﬂuid dynamic models on atomiza-
tion [78–80] relate the average size of drops to a power of a
characteristic Weber number We = rV2L/s, where L is a represen-
tative length scale of the initial conﬁguration, for example the
thickness of the liquid sheet.
Jet breakup: The formation of drops from a liquid jet occurs by
several instability mechanisms that break the jet into a train of
drops, as e.g. in Fig. 6d. These mechanisms are reviewed in [23,81].
Instabilities are characterized by their driving and resisting forces,
their temporal evolution (growth rate) and their spatial features
(wavelength l). Understanding how instabilities grow helps to
determine the time of breakup and the size distribution of the drops.
4. Flight of drops
4.1. Description in the BPA literature
One of the main issues in BPA is to determine where a blood
spatter originates from, for the purpose of reconstructing the
bloodletting event. This operation involves the backward recon-
struction of drop trajectories based on the inspection of the stains
and on a model for the ﬂight of drops.
Fig. 5. Early attempts of visualizing drop impact. (A-B) show various shapes assumed by a drop of milk impacting on a glass target, as sketched in 1876 by Worthington,
without a camera, but with the help of an electrical spark generator and of his retinal persistence. Hand-drawn sketches show ring accumulation during the impact, splashing
and the formation of spines. Reproduced freely from [54], the content of which being out of copyright according to the Royal Society.

--- PAGE 9 ---

The traditional terminology used for trajectory reconstruction
is illustrated in Fig. 7 and deﬁned in Table 4. The three-dimensional
region of origin of a blood spatter is called the area of origin, and its
normal 
projection 
onto 
a 
horizontal 
plane 
is 
the 
area 
of
convergence. The area of convergence corresponds to the intersec-
tion of straight lines with direction g, linear projections onto a
horizontal plane of the ballistic trajectories of the blood drops. To
determine the area of origin, BPA experts use the angle of impact a
from several stains using the visual inspection methods of Section
5.1. This angle is the acute angle at which a blood drop strikes the
target, see Fig. 7b. As an example, in Fig. 7a, the area of origin, target
plane and area of convergence are respectively the region near the
head of the victim, the ﬂoor and the area on the ﬂoor supporting
the feet of the victim; labeled as a1–4 are the angles of impacts of
four drops.
An early BPA study on the relation between impact spatters
and the area of origin is the graphical work of Piotrowski (1895),
extensively reproduced and commented in [82]. The work
describes among others the spatial distribution of stains created
by a hammer impacting a pool of blood, and the blade of a hatchet
hitting either a rabbit head or blood-soaked cotton cloths.
Piotrowski observed that the orientation of the stains can
indicate the origin of the blood spatter. Both Piotrowski’s and
Balthazard et al.’s [42,82] work specify that bloodstain trajecto-
ries are not straight lines, a concept also reﬂected in the BPA
literature by mention of ‘bent trajectories’, ‘ballistic trajectories’
or ‘parabolic trajectories’, to acknowledge the inﬂuence of
gravity and drag forces.
As stated in 1939 in Balthazard et al., [42] ‘‘Le proble`me [of
reconstructing trajectories] est tre`s difﬁcile a` re´soudre’’. Indeed,
reconstructing trajectories is still very difﬁcult today. A ﬁrst-order
approach to reconstruct trajectories is to assume that the droplets
travel in a straight line. Reconstruction methods based on straight
trajectories, such as the method of strings or the trigonometric

method, have been used in crime scene reconstruction since at
least the 1950s [83] and have been implemented in software
routinely used in crime scenes [84–88]. There is abundant BPA
literature on the uncertainties associated with the choice of stains
and their inspection to determine the angle of impact and area of
origin [89–93]. The uncertainties are of two types, the error
induced by assuming linear trajectories, and the uncertainty in
determining the angles g and a from stain inspection. Uncertainty
on a has been reported to stem from the asymmetrical nature of
bloodstains, the inappropriate use of a protractor [94], or the
measurement of the length and width of the stains [95,96]. BPA
experts are well aware that the area of origin is determined in an
approximate sense [4], either as a maximum height from where
the drops could originate, or ‘‘within the volume of a grapefruit, or
even a basketball’’. This level of accuracy is considered satisfactory
for many crime scene reconstruction purposes [4]. Indeed, [97]
reports errors on the determination of the region of origin larger
than 44 cm due to the assumption of straight trajectories. Similarly
veriﬁes experimentally that the stringing method ‘‘over-estimates
the point of origin and the error associated with this technique is
signiﬁcant (50% on average).’’ Such error is signiﬁcant enough to
wrongly conclude that a person was standing when in fact they
may have been sitting.
Recently, BPA research has proposed methods to reconstruct
curved trajectories. Buck et al. [43] reconstructed drop trajectories
using ballistic calculations, considering gravity and drag forces. In
their ballistic analysis, they screen a range of velocity values for
compatibility with the preservation of the drop during the ﬂight
(no breakup by drag overcoming surface forces, see Fig. 4). Some
assumptions associated with their analysis are discussed in [98].
[99] describes ‘‘a method of reconstructing the area of origin in a
nonlinear manner’’, that incorporates the effects of drag into
trajectory calculations, using probability densities. Finally, a
statistical procedure [100] based on aggregate statistics and the
basic equation of projectile motion has been shown to determine
the area of origin of a blood spatter for cases when the spatter is
launched within a narrow range of polar angles. Since ballistic
reconstruction involves the knowledge of impact velocity and drop
size (see section 4.2), a signiﬁcant amount of recent BPA work has
focused on obtaining that information by inspecting the stains, as
discussed in Section 5.1.
A crime scene can be messy, and stain selection is important in
determining the area of origin. Typically, the crime scene
investigator 
selects 
stains 
based 
on 
the 
following 
criteria:
accessibility, adhesion to the target surface, abundance, and
relative location [97]. Once these stains are chosen, their location is
measured, the stains are photographed as a basis to determine
their 
directional 
and 
impact 
angles, 
so 
that 
the 
areas 
of
convergence and origin of the blood spatter can be determined.
BPA researchers are also aware of two bounds on the velocities
of drops: (1) drops will break if drag forces overcome surface
tension forces [43], and (2) gravity will not accelerate a drop in still
air beyond the terminal velocity [101], which is provided in Fig. 4.
Recent BPA work has identiﬁed two limitations of the ballistic
reconstruction of trajectories:
1) The area of origin of the drops is distinct from the area of origin
of a blood spatter, because the drop generation process involves
a sequence of topological changes, such as, for example, during
the breakup of a liquid sheet [13].
2) The air through which the drops ﬂy is not always at rest;
sometimes the air plays an active role in the transport of drops.
In that case, Eq. (1) is still valid to calculate the trajectory, but
the velocity used in the related Eq. (2) is the velocity difference
between the drop and the air. For instance, experiments
involving respiration-caused blood spatters have demonstrated
the importance of understanding the role of the surrounding air
[102], which helped carrying sub-mm drops further away than
occurs in still air.
4.2. Fluid dynamics description
The trajectory of drops has been studied in several applications
of a subﬁeld of FD called multiphase ﬂow [58,103–106], relevant
for example to spray painting, inkjet printing, fuel injection,
meteorology, medical sprays, and the fabrication of micro-
particles. Typical topics of interests in multiphase ﬂow are the
generation and control of desired distributions of drops size and
velocities. The relevant physical parameters and forces are the
same as in BPA, the surface tension and viscosity, the drag and
gravity forces, and their effects on the drop velocity, shape and
temperature. As reviewed in Section 3.2, a wide array of
experimental tools are used by the multiphase ﬂow community
to characterize the trajectory of drops and of clouds of drops.
Fig. 8 builds on the model problem of Fig. 7, which relates to the
reconstruction of ballistic trajectories. For the sake of simplicity,
the air is assumed quiescent. In that framework, the trajectories are
governed by Eqs. (1) and (2). To solve these equations and
reconstruct ballistic trajectories, values of the impact angles,
impact velocity and drop size are needed.
Parametric studies in Fig. 8 illustrate how uncertainties on the
impact angle, impact velocity and drop diameter inﬂuence the
determination of the region of origin of that speciﬁc blood spatter.
To do so, the baseline case (black solid curve) is modiﬁed with a
typical uncertainty on the impact angles (top right), on the impact
velocity (top right) and the drop size (bottom left). The value of the
typical uncertainty is set to +/-10%, as it is representative of
uncertainties in the measured the impact angle [95,96], the droplet
impact velocity [107] and diameter [107], the latter two being
determined with the method of spines. For the speciﬁc BPA
example in Figs. 7 and 8 the largest errors on the determination of
the area of origin are shown in Fig. 8d, and come from (in order of
the magnitude of the effect): neglecting gravity (error of several
meter), neglecting drag, uncertainty on the impact velocity and
impact angle, and uncertainty on the diameter of the drop.
Calculations of trajectories are not trivial because ﬂying drops
do not behave as rigid particles: they might deform or break up in
smaller drops when the drag forces become comparable with the
surface tension forces, as explained in Section 2.2.1(b1). Recombi-
nation and oscillations might occur during ﬂight, see Section 3.2,
affecting the drag, the calculation of trajectories as well as the stain
shapes and sizes [19,108,109]. Another concept important for the
reconstruction of trajectories is the notion of terminal velocity,
described in Section 2.2.1(b3). Also, when droplets are generated at
velocities comparable to the speed of sound, e.g. by gunshot, the
drag coefﬁcient depends on the compressibility of the air. In that
case, correlations used in rocket design could be used [110] for the
estimate of the drag force.
It is also important to mention that blood spatters originate from
blood at body temperature (37 8C) that typically travels through
colder air and impacts a colder target. To the best of our knowledge,
the issue of the cooling of the droplet in ﬂight and during impact
[111] has never been addressed in the context of BPA, as shown in
Table 4. This issue might be important because the physical
properties of blood vary considerably: when cooled down from 37 8C
to 20 8C (Table 1), the viscosity and surface tension increase by 60%
and 27%, respectively. Such large changes of physical properties
affect the Reynolds and Weber number, which might affect in-ﬂight
atomization, drop spreading, spine formation and splashing.
A related issue is the evaporation of drops during ﬂight, which
might be most important for small drops traveling at large
velocities, because of their higher surface to volume ratios.

5. Impact
5.1. Description in the BPA literature
As early as 1939, Balthazard et al. [42] pioneered the scientiﬁc
investigation of drop impact for BPA, investigating experimentally
and rigorously how the fall height of a drop inﬂuences the shapes
of stains, for both normal and oblique impact. These authors took
care to discriminate interesting ﬁndings from useable ﬁndings, and
recorded ﬁrst high-speed movies of blood drop impact. Indeed the
relation between the shape of a stain and the impact conditions of
the related drop is key for reconstructing trajectories.
As of today, impact is probably the best understood of the four
chronological stages described in this review (drop formation,
ﬂight, impact and staining). An excellent exposition of the current
knowledge in BPA on drop impact is available in the recent review
of Adam [14].
Before the early 2000s, the BPA community named the blood
spatters in relation to the speed associated with the spatter
generation, with the terms of Low, Medium or High Velocity Impact
Spatter [5]. The reason was to acknowledge an inverse correlation
between the stain sizes and the magnitude of the velocity or
momentum applied to the static blood to produce the spatter.
Later, this classiﬁcation scheme was reconsidered after observing
overlapping stain sizes between the Medium and High Velocity
categories. A novel taxonomy, with examples in the left column of
Table 4, was proposed by The Scientiﬁc Working Group for
Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (SWGSTAIN, an FBI-founded interna-
tional group). The taxonomy classiﬁes the stains in three categories
[5] based on the mechanisms driving the staining process: passive
stains are caused by gravity as the only driving force; spatter stains
are formed by additional forces besides gravity, such as the
momentum of an impact, and altered stains exhibit the inﬂuence
of physical or physiological events occurring after the staining
process, such as cleanup attempts, decomposition or ﬂaking.
Normal impact
When the impact angle a = 908 (see Fig. 7b), the impact is
normal to the target. An impact under any other angle is called
oblique, and will be treated subsequently as it involves a more
complex and asymmetrical deformation of the drop.
Upon normal impact, the contact diameter between the drop
and the target surface expands until it reaches a maximum, in a
process called spreading. In [42], a relation was found experimen-
tally between the height of a drop in free fall, and the diameter of
the stain: the higher the fall, the larger the spreading and stain size.
Fig. 8. Examples of how uncertainties on physical parameters inﬂuence the determination of the area of origin of a blood spatter: (a) Effect of uncertainty in the impact angle;
(b) effect of uncertainty in impact velocity; (c) effect of uncertainty in drop diameter; d) estimated heights of area of origin for initial conditions reported in Figs. 7 and 8. In
ﬁgures (a–c), the baseline case is the same as in Fig. 7, while a representative error of +10% is assumed for the overestimation curve, and of 10% for the underestimation curve.

--- PAGE 12 ---

The simplest parameter to characterize the spreading is the spread
factor dmax/d0, i.e. the ratio of the maximum contact diameter over
the initial drop diameter. The spread factor has been estimated
using ﬁrst-order FD models [13,112–114]. These models compare
the various energy terms available before impact (potential,
surface, 
kinetic) 
with energy 
terms available after impact,
considering that some of the impact energy has been dissipated
by e.g. viscous forces. Since spreading is typically driven by inertia
and gravity and resisted by surface tension and viscous forces, the
spread factor can be estimated with a relation of the kind, dmax/
d0 = f(Re, We, Fr), with the dimensionless numbers deﬁned as in
Table 2. Arguing that in several cases relevant to BPA, We >> Re
and neglecting the effect of gravity during the impact, Chandra’s
group proposed the correlation [114]
dmax
d0
ﬃ1
2 Re1=4: 
(8)
Relations developed with a similar approach are also in
[11,115].
By itself, the description of Eq. (8) is of limited use in BPA
because the initial diameter of a drop is rarely known; however,
the combined measurement of spreading and spines (below) can
help estimate the impact conditions.
When the impact energy is large enough, the edge of round stains
are no longer smooth, but rather disturbed by spines – also called
ﬁngers, scallops, sunburst effect [116] or spikes – as shown in Fig. 9a.
Spines appear in increasing number as the impact velocity increases
[42]. The instability mechanism responsible for the formation of
these spines has only been investigated recently. Marmanis and
Thoroddsen [117] developed a correlation between the impact
Reynolds number and the number of ﬁngers, N, and attributed the
ﬁngering to interactions between inertial and viscous forces, see also
[118]. Recently, Hulse-Smith et al. [114] proposed a correlation
dependent on a target-speciﬁc empirical coefﬁcient, C  O(1), and on
the Weber number, i.e. the ratio of inertial forces (that enhance
ﬁngering) to the surface forces (that reduce ﬁngering), where
N ¼ C
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
We
p
: 
(9)
Reference [114] proposes to combine Eqs. (8) and (9) to
determine d0 and v0 based on the measurement of the stain size
dmax and of the number of spines N, assuming that the material
properties of the blood (r, m, and s) and of the target material (C)
are known. That approach to determine the impact conditions from
the inspection of a stain is known as the method of spines. A derived
approach, independent of the physical properties of the blood, is
described in [107] for impacts on paper, drywall and wood. Spines
can merge or be indistinguishable from oscillations on the edge of
the stain due to local changes of substrate roughness or wettability.
As a result, there is an inherent subjectivity in determining the
number of spines, leading to recommendation in Hulse-Smith and
Illes [107] that only one individual count all the spines related to a
speciﬁc BPA study. In [14], Adam also mentions two limits of
applicability of the method of spines: the absence of spines for low-
energy impacts and the saturation of the number of spines at high
Weber numbers, see Fig. 9b.
The occurrence of splashing –the breakup of the drop into
distinct amounts of liquid upon impact- can be explained in
relation to the formation of spines. Since the formation of the
spines is driven by inertia and resisted by capillary and viscous
forces, three regimes can be identiﬁed in a Re–We plane (or in a v0–
d0) plane. When the ratio of inertia over capillary and viscous
forces is low, the drop spreads without scallops nor spines.
When that ratio becomes larger, the edge of the stain exhibits
spines. When that ratio becomes critically large, instabilities grow
to the point of breakup and splashing [118]. Quantitative criteria to
discriminate between these three regions are described in [14].
Regarding the inﬂuence of the target, as documented by
Balthazard et al. [42], its shape, material, preparation, structure
and oxidation inﬂuence the spreading of drops, the formation of
spines and of stains. Since most blood drop impact studies have
been made on paper, the corresponding published BPA literature is
only valid for impacts on paper targets. For instance, Balthazard
et al. mention [42] that their results are only valid for impact on a
speciﬁc type of cardboard paper. In [4,119], MacDonell writes
about how the substrate roughness can increase spatter, i.e.
promote splashing. Studies [89,114] compare blood drop impact
on different substrates (glass, paper, steel and wood), with
different roughness. Note also that a speciﬁc class of target
surfaces is of speciﬁc importance for BPA: clothes [120].
A large set of high-speed visualization experiments of normal and
oblique impacts on various substrates, at various speeds, is available,
with the techniques and from the sources mentioned in Section 3.1.
Two questionable assumptions sometimes appear in BPA reports
on the impact of drops:

1) the stain area corresponds to the maximum contact area between
the drop and the target during impact (=maximum spreading). This
is probably realistic for substrates that are hydrophilic, but not
for hydrophobic substrates, such as greasy tiles, where the stain
diameter can be smaller than the maximum diameter reached
during impact, as clearly shown in [42]
2) the stain diameter indicates the distance of fall [121], or the impact
velocity: this is only true if the initial size of the drop is known, as
was also clearly shown in [42].
Oblique impact
The oblique impact of drops on a surface is illustrated in Fig. 10,
and result in elliptical stains. The lateral spreading W (the minor
axis of the elliptic stain, perpendicularly to the projection of the
velocity vector on the target) is driven not by the whole velocity,
but by the velocity component normal to the surface [14]. An
equation similar to Eq. (8) therefore applies, where Re is deﬁned
based on the velocity component normal to the surface. The axial
spreading, L, along the projection of the impact velocity onto the
target plane is typically larger than W: while the velocity
component normal to the surface induces axial spreading similarly
as the longitudinal spreading, the cylindrical path of the droplet
intercepts the surface at an angle a, and this latter contribution
makes L larger than W, so that the stain is elliptical.
Experiments show that the ratio W/L of the extension in the
lateral direction over that in the forward direction increases
monotonically with an increasing impact angle [42], following a
trigonometric relation ﬁrst established in [122]
W=L ¼ sina: 
(10)
Measuring the ellipticity of a stain therefore provides important
information on the impact angle. The error using the formula (10)
is estimated in [89,121]. Note that elliptic stains do not necessarily
imply an oblique impact, as any relative motion of the target
perpendicular to the drop trajectory can cause a non-circularity in
the observed stain, a fact studied experimentally in [123].
Balthazard et al. described that the impact velocity modiﬁes the
shape and number of spines at the forward end of a stain resulting
from an oblique impact [42]. Knock and Davidson [124] propose an

(white outline) and experimental drop/stain shape prior-to impact and 13.8 ms after impact; and (c) variation with respect to time of L and W. The ﬁnal experimental W/L

approach to determines d0 and v0 by inspection of the bloodstain
size and the number of spines for oblique impact.
In relation to splashing, Pizzola et al. [41] describe the formation
of a wave-castoff, this single satellite drop detaching from the
forward end of the parent drop during an oblique impact.
Several recent publications on the impact of blood drops have
related the outcomes (spine formation, stain diameter and
shape) to impact conditions within a dimensionless framework
[11,14,114]. For example, Adam [14] proposed that the observed
impact behavior of blood droplets (i.e. gentle spreading into a
smooth ellipse, appearance of scallops or spines, splashing into
several drops) is controlled by the ratio of the inertia of the ﬂow
at the wetting line parallel to the target plane, over the
stabilizing forces of viscous dissipation and surface tension. A
similar theory was veriﬁed for Newtonian ﬂuids [125] and
explains why, in experiments where the inertia of the impact is
gradually increased, scallops, spines and splashes are typically
observed at the leading edge of a stain earlier than at the trailing
edge.
A misconception concerning oblique impact is that the stain
width equals the drop diameter [90]. This is not a universal truth as
evidenced by W  d0 in Fig. 10.
5.2. Fluid dynamics description
Several reviews of the ﬂuid dynamics of drop impacts on liquid
and solid surface are available in [126–128]. Upon impact, the fate
of a droplet can have various outcomes, such as spreading,
splashing, bouncing, or a combination of these. These outcomes are
reviewed 
here 
considering 
mostly 
normal 
impacts. 
As 
the
description of impact is quite extensive in the BPA literature,
the present section does not repeat what was exposed in details in
Section 5.1.
While FD researchers can use the same wide collection of
experimental tools to describe drop impact as for drop breakup,
there is also a mature FD discipline called Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD), which can be presented as follows. CFD has been
widely applied to drop impacts and offers research and teaching
opportunities for BPA, as exempliﬁed in Fig. 10. The fundamental
equation describing FD phenomena such as the impact of a drop of
Newtonian ﬂuid is the Navier–Stokes equation, the expression of
Newton’s second law, Eq. (1), for ﬂuid ﬂows. Because of its explicit
modeling of the viscous dissipation inherent to ﬂuid ﬂows, the
Navier–Stokes equation is a non-linear, second-order partial
differential equation, quite difﬁcult to solve with pen and paper.
CFD methods are computer-based techniques to solve equations
such as the Navier–Stokes equations. To do so, the volume (the
deforming drop) and the time (for example, from impact to drying)
of interest are divided into a large amount of small volumes and
small time increments. The Navier–Stokes equations are then
discretized, i.e. expressed in an algebraic manner, for each of the
small volumes and times, reducing the complex partial differential
equations into large numbers of algebraic equations that can be
numerically solved with computers.
CFD studies on droplet impact have been reviewed in [127].
These numerical efforts were pioneered by Harlow and Shannon in
the 1960s [129]. Subsequent work added the effect of viscosity
[130], surface tension [131], wetting [113] and heat transfer during
impact [132]. Later, researchers studied numerically the evapora-
tion of drops on solid surfaces, see Section 6.2.
There are currently no simulation tools that solve both the
impact of a drop and the formation of a stain, but current
simulation techniques are ready to address this challenge. These
simulation tools could be used for investigating parameters that
are difﬁcult to investigate experimentally, such as the inﬂuence of
viscosity, substrate wettability, or drop sizes and velocities that
are relevant to crime scenes, but difﬁcult to reproduce experi-
mentally.
An example of current capabilities of Computational Fluid
Dynamics is shown in Fig. 10a. Input parameters of that simulation
are the target wettability and the impact conditions. These
preliminary three-dimensional simulations incorporate a dynamic
wetting model [133,134]. The simulation of oblique impact of a
blood droplet on a paper target shows similar features as the
experiments. For example, the simulated evolution of the wetting
line, i.e. the motion of the boundary of the stain, closely matches
the experimental data.
The spatial and temporal resolutions of the simulation in Fig. 10
are however insufﬁcient to capture the surface instabilities and the
subsequent splashing observed at the leading edge of the
impacting droplet, visible for times 3 to 10 ms. In that context,
it is important to mention that simulations are not a panacea,
because of the difﬁculty to model phenomena such as spine
formation or wetting, which feature signiﬁcantly smaller time
scales or length scales than the typical scales used in the
simulation. CFD simulations are indeed numerical representations
of the continuum reality and necessarily partition the time and
space with a given resolution, in a similar way as a digital picture
images the real object with a given resolution of pixels.
To accurately estimate the spreading with Eq. (8), the viscosity
of the blood needs to be known. In contrast to Newtonian ﬂuids like
water and liquid metals, the viscosity of blood is reduced by the
high shear rates experienced during the impact process. In fact,
during the early stages of the impact, for geometric reasons, the
ﬂuid velocities can be orders of magnitude larger than the impact
velocity [127]; also, at large Reynolds numbers, the drop spreads
into a very thin ﬁlm surrounded by a donut-shaped ring where
ﬂuid accumulates [135]. The combination of large velocities and a
thin ﬁlm induces very large shear rates during the impact, causing
the viscosity to decrease signiﬁcantly. This begs the questions:
what viscosity value should be used to calculate the droplet Reynolds
number for describing impact conditions? This question can be
answered as follows. The viscosities provided in Table 1 are for
shear rates on the order of several hundred s1, above which the
dependence on shear is somewhat limited, since thinning has
already occurred. Considering that most viscous energy dissipation
during impact would occur in a thin sheet (length scales below
1 mm), the shear rate would likely be at least on the order of 1 m/s /
0.001 m, or 1000 s1. It is thus reasonable to assume that the initial
droplet spreading characteristics can be described by the high-
shear viscosities provided in Table 1. Note that the latter stages of
droplet spreading and the staining process occur at much smaller
velocities and shear rates, and therefore proceed at much higher
viscosity.
In [126], Yarin describes the threshold condition which
determines whether the drop spreads or splashes upon impact,
based on considerations of the physical forces exposed in 5.1.1.
Splashing typically occurs after a circular sheet or ‘‘corona’’ is
formed [136]. The criterion to discriminate between spreading or
splashing is
ReWe2 ¼ K4: 
(11)
where K is a target-dependent empirical constant, estimated as
57.7 in [136]. The inﬂuence of the substrate on the spreading and
splashing has been studied in [126,137–141]. Recent research by
Nagel’s and Brenner’s groups has identiﬁed that the compressibili-
ty of the air surrounding the droplet [142,143] affects the
splashing. For typical BPA situations, their results agree with the
criterion of Eq. (11).
In 1967, Ford and Furmidge [144] considered the inﬂuence of
target wettability on the impact and spreading of drops. As
D. Attinger et al. / Forensic Science International 231 (2013) 375–396
388


--- PAGE 15 ---

discussed in Section 2.2, the target elasticity –even the hardest
glass or metal have some degree of elasticity- also inﬂuences the
splashing. Lesser showed analytically [145] that during impact, the
onset of sideways jetting of liquid from beneath the drop will be
delayed by an elastic response of the wall, a phenomenon
conﬁrmed experimentally [146]. Rein [128] reviews that the
elastic response of most surfaces has no inﬂuence at low velocities,
but becomes important during high-speed impacts.
Importantly, the wetting angle (see Fig. 2) is not a constant
during impact as described in [133]. The wetting angle is also
function of the direction of motion of the wetting line (advancing
or receding), and of the relative speed between the wetting line
and the substrate (or the capillary number). This dynamic behavior
of the wetting angle inﬂuences the spreading and is still a topic of
current FD research [133,147–150].
Upon impact, the liquid contained in the drop might fully or
partially bounce away from the wall [126,151–153]. A correlation
in [154] predicts the volume of Newtonian liquid that will be
retained on a solid surface, based on the difference (or hysteresis)
between receding and advancing wetting angles.
The impact of drops on liquid surfaces has been reviewed in
[128], and involves the deformation by the impacting drop of the
free surface of the liquid into a liquid sheet. That protruding liquid
sheet, sometimes in the form of a crown, might break up into drops,
by instability mechanisms described in Section 3.2. Impact on
liquid surfaces is important for basic FD studies on, for example,
the noise of rain, and also for drip patterns in BPA.
6. Staining
This section focuses on how the stain forms, after the impact
has deformed the drop. In other words, non-inertial aspects of the
ﬂuid transport are discussed, since inertial aspects (spread factor,
impact angle, ﬁngering, splashing) associated with the impact have
already been discussed.
6.1. Description in the BPA literature
The uneven thickness of stains was described by Balthazard et al.
[42], who noticed that the periphery of stains is typically thicker
than their center. The authors guessed (rightly as shown in the late
1990s [155]) that the depressed center is rather due to some
phenomenon occurring during the drying phase rather than to the
presence of air bubbles in the impacting drop. The same work [42]
commented on the presence of scale-like structures in the crust of
the stain, and noticed that the appearance of the crust depends on
the 
type 
of 
blood 
used, 
either 
real 
blood 
or 
blood 
with
anticoagulant. They also mentioned that stains resulting from
oblique impact are inhomogeneous, the bottom part being ‘‘crust-
like’’ and dark, while the upper part is pink.
Balthazard et al. [42] also studied how capillary forces drive
blood into fabrics, noticing faster imbibition rates along the ﬁbers
than across. Kirk [120] also notes that some bloodstains go straight
from the generation to the staining phase, describing the case of a
stabbed woman whose blood had ﬂowed between her breasts and
into her clothing.
During drying, stains might suddenly detach from certain
targets. This alteration process called delamination or warping is
caused by radial stresses due to the shrinkage of the stain, which
overcome adhesive forces between the blood and target. This effect
occurs on smooth plastic sheets, but not on some rougher plastics
as described in [42]. Another alteration process is described in the
fascinating study [157] on how insects modify the shape of existing
bloodstains or create artifact bloodstains.
Kirk [120] also describes methods to identify if a bloodstain
comes from the perpetrator or from the victim (a question
resolved later by genetic testing), as well as methods to spot
bloodstains on backgrounds where stains do not stand out.
Several chemical, physical or optical methods have recently been
developed in BPA for detecting weakly visible stains, using
functionalized nanoparticles [158] or Raman scattering [159], and
for determining the age of bloodstains, as reviewed by Bremmer
et al. [160].
6.2. Fluid dynamics description
Blood is not only a ﬂuid containing particles (complex ﬂuid), it is
also a ﬂuid initiating coagulation as soon as it ﬂows out of the
human body. Once the kinetic energy associated with the impact
has dissipated, the formation of a stain on a solid, impermeable
target, depends on the following physical processes: wettability
[161], evaporation, viscous dissipation, diffusion and coagulation.
Reference [162] discusses the relationship between the rheology of
the blood and the stages of blood clotting. Reference [12] describes
the effects of various anticoagulants on the trail length left by a
drop running along an inclined surface.
The formation of stains during the drying of complex ﬂuids has
recently become the focus of ﬂuid dynamics studies motivated
either by the ubiquity of this natural phenomenon, or by
manufacturing applications of evaporative self-assembly. For
instance, the formation of rings at the periphery of stains has
been explained in [155] by the combination of a radial ﬂow driven
by enhanced evaporation at the wetting line, and pinning of the
same wetting line by accumulation of particles carried by the radial
Fig. 11. A magniﬁed stain reveals a wealth of features; some of these features, such as cracks in the corona, are of interest to determine the impact or drying conditions. Images

ﬂow. The evaporation of a drop of a complex ﬂuid such as blood is a
typical multiphase process, featuring a cascade of dimensional
transport phenomena: wetting at the (1D) wetting line drives the
motion of the (2D) solid-air interface, where surface stresses due to
chemical or thermal non-equilibrium such as Marangoni stresses
[97] drive the bulk ﬂow (3D) inside the drop. Several ﬂuid dynamic
studies have addressed either experimentally or theoretically the
interplay of transport phenomena during drop drying and stain
formation [163,164]. For instance, Hu and Larson [165,166]
modeled the evaporation of a drop of pure liquid with a pinned
wetting line. Simulations of the formation of stains have recently
been performed [167–170]; this requires solving the motion of the
liquid and of many suspended solid particles. This is a non-trivial
task, because of, for example, the interaction of the particles with
the wetting line [170].
The formation of stains on porous targets like fabrics and
garments 
involves 
the 
additional 
complexity 
of 
imbibition.
Imbibition is the transport of blood into the fabric, driven by
wetting forces and resisted by viscous forces. For one-dimensional
imbibition, for example the imbibition of a large cloth dipped
normally into a pool of blood, the wetted length evolves as the
square root of the time [171]. Some analytical results for more

complex geometries are referenced in [172]. Reference [173]
discusses the effect of surfactants on the ability of a liquid to spread
into a fabric.
The formation of cracks on stains has been studied in [174]:
Allain and Limat showed that the spacing between the cracks
was controlled by the competition between the mechanical
relaxation due to the opening of a crack, and the increased
mechanical stress due to the enhanced evaporation across the
walls of the crack. Brutin et al. ([156], Fig. 11) propose a relation
between the density of cracks in the crown and the initial drop
volume.
7. Synthesis of the relationship between BPA and FD concepts,
summary table and research opportunities
Section 2 described the body forces and surface forces at play in
the FD of BPA. All these forces are proportional to some physical
properties of the blood and/or the target, such as surface tension,
viscosity, density, or wettability. It is therefore important to have
accurate measurements of these physical properties. Also, while
most BPA studies assume typical values for the physical properties,
the blood of individuals has properties within a range of values. A
cyclist competing for the Tour de France typically has more viscous
blood, richer in hematocrit [175,176], than an average person.
Therefore, studies could be performed to (1) assess the uncertainty
involved in using typical physical properties; and (2) reﬁne BPA
methods to consider the physical properties of the speciﬁc
protagonists identiﬁed in the bloodletting event. Precise knowl-
edge of, for example, the viscosity and surface tension of the blood
spilled at a crime scene might reduce the uncertainty associated
with BPA.
A related and speciﬁc issue in BPA is that freshly drawn human
blood potentially carries pathogens, so substitutes to human blood
have been sought since early BPA studies [42] for the purpose of
improving the safety of BPA research and teaching. As a result,
research opportunities exist in BPA for the development or
characterization of substitutes to fresh human blood, such as
animal or synthetic blood.
Section 2 also describes an opportunity for the elaboration,
publication and dissemination of regime maps that describe
aspects of BPA within a dimensionless framework, with ratios of
forces. Such maps could characterize the ﬂight or breakup of drops
(as in Fig. 4), impact outcomes, and transformations during drying.
Section 3 reviews several aspects of the ﬂuid dynamics of drop
generation relevant to BPA. Importantly, high-speed measure-
ments show that in several situations relevant to BPA the drops
are not generated at a single point in space, but rather at the
breakup location of an initial jet or liquid sheet, protruding from
the area of origin of the blood spatter [13], during a cascade of
events with speciﬁc temporal duration and spatial extension. This
cascade of events needs to be understood, modeled as simply as
possible and considered for the reconstruction of ballistic
trajectories. In that context, there is also an opportunity for
models 
and 
experiments 
that 
link 
the 
kinematics 
of 
the
bloodletting event to the size and speed of the generated drops,
as described in Section 3.2.
While the breakup of jets and sheets has been widely
investigated in FD, some drop generation mechanisms (gunshot
and cast-off spatters) are speciﬁc to BPA and might beneﬁt from
systematic FD studies. Section 4 reviews FD and BPA studies on the
ﬂight of drops. A full backward modeling of the ballistic trajectories
of droplets is not yet available for the BPA practitioner. This
possibly implies signiﬁcant uncertainties on the determination of
the area of origin. In that context, it would be useful to the BPA
practitioner to have a simple method to discriminate between
spatters that are suitable for the stringing method and the ones
that call for ballistic trajectories.
Also, the accurate reconstruction of curved trajectories (Figs. 7
and 8) relies on the development of reliable methods to estimate
the following variables explicitly: impact velocity, impact angle,
and impacting drop size.
To the best of our knowledge, a framework is missing for the
reconstruction of trajectories in non-quiescent air, such as gunshot
spatters, injuries in windy conditions, or expirated spatters.
Necessarily, that framework will involve solving the coupled
problem of the airﬂow and the drop ﬂight, a problem that is
routinely solved in e.g. the design of fuel injectors. That example
suggests that signiﬁcant untapped expertise is available in the
multiphase ﬂow community, in terms of experimental, theoretical
and numerical tools.
Section 5 reviews BPA and FD studies on the impact of drops,
and describes the potential of computational ﬂuid dynamics
to study drop impact cases that are difﬁcult to reproduce

experimentally, involving, for example, small drops traveling at
high speed after a gunshot spatter. Related experiments are
inherently difﬁcult, in terms of measuring the ratios of drop sizes
over stain sizes, or of characterizing how a cloud of drops travels at
velocities on the order of 100 m/s.
The ﬂight, impact and drying of blood drops is typically a non-
isothermal process, since the blood is spilled at 37 8C and the air
and target surface are at lower, room temperature. The resulting
heat transfer modiﬁes the physical properties of the drop
signiﬁcantly [70,177], as described in Section 4.2, with possible
consequences on the amount of spreading during impact (see Table
4), or on the stain formation, as has been shown for the ﬁeld of
maskless manufacturing [111]. Heat transfer analyses of drop
impact can either be done analytically or via numerical simulations
coupling

There is also no general theory describing the inﬂuence of the
target (e.g. roughness, permeability, wettability) on the spreading,
ﬁngering and splashing process. Speciﬁcally there is no simple
model for dynamic wetting, although several approaches have
been developed recently [24,147,178–180].
Section 6 reviews FD and BPA studies on the formation of
stains. Little work has been done on the timing of drying
processes, which possibly could tell about the chronology of
the bloodletting events. As investigated by Herb MacDonell [181],
the growing ring forming at the edge of bloodstains is more
adherent to the target than the center of the stain so that wiped-
off bloodstains can be used to estimate the time between the
staining and wipe-off event. Also, blood drops contain a speciﬁc
ratio of liquid to solids, and three-dimensional measurements of
stains are likely be correlated with the drop volume, a parameter
relevant to the reconstruction of ballistic trajectories. To the best
of our knowledge, another open problem would be to determine
physical criteria for delamination.
A synthesis of the relations between FD and BPA is provided in
Table 4c. This table shows the type of relationship between BPA
concepts (rows, deﬁned in Table 4a) and FD concepts (columns,
deﬁned in Table 4b), with colors indicating the type of relationship
between the concepts. Table 4c also expresses the type of relation
(non-existent, accidental, essential). When available, key refer-
ences from the literature are provided for individual cells of the
table.
8. Conclusion and epilogue
This manuscript has highlighted some key relationships
between the disciplines of bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) in
forensics and that of ﬂuid dynamics (FD) in the physical sciences.
The body of knowledge related to drop generation, drop ﬂight,
drop impact, and stain formations has been presented as it
is known in the BPA and FD communities. Tables 1 and 2
summarize key physical properties and parameters relevant to
BPA, with their typical values. Novel material has been proposed
demonstrating the use of dimensionless numbers (Figs. 3 and 4),
assessing the importance of parabolic trajectories (Figs. 7 and 8).
The intent of this work is to help build bridges between the
BPA and FD communities, expanding and reﬁning the many
existing connections summarized in Table 4c. Also, in the
context of the 2009 report of the US National Research Council
advocating for stronger scientiﬁc foundations in BPA, several
opportunities for joint research between BPA and FD have been
mentioned.
Regarding the crime scene in Fig. 1, the BPA analyst and
coauthor C.M. proposed the following interpretation after a BPA
analysis. The victim suffered multiple stab wounds and was left
lying on the ﬂoor. During that time, blood pools on the kitchen ﬂoor
(Area AE in Fig. 1). Then, the victim stands up using the stove for
support, probably causing with his arm the ﬂow (AA) and transfer
patterns (AB) on the stove. Standing still, blood drips causing the
drip stain pattern (AD). Then the victim walks towards the living
room, and is attacked again in the hallway. Several elliptical stains
(B) on the hallway wall can be used to determine the area of origin
of the resulting spatter. Can we expect joint future FD and BPA
research to help reﬁne this interpretation? Probably. Research on
atomization mechanisms might clarify the causes of spatter B, be it
for instance a beating or a stabbing. Research on ballistic
reconstruction of trajectories might improve the determination
of the area of origin of spatter B. Research on the drying of stains
might help telling when the pool AE formed, and how much time
elapsed before the victim stood up, forming the associated drip
patterns AD.

Appendix A. Calculations of the various integrals presented in
Section 2.2.1
In this appendix we provide exact expressions of the integrals
deﬁned in Section 2.2.1. Note that the trajectories are along a vertical
z-axis oriented upwards, with the target at z = 0 and the release of the
drop at a height z = h.

where h is the height of the fall, and the drag force FD is a function of
the local velocity, as per Eqs. (2) and (3). The term left in the

Appendix B. How to use of impact velocity plot in Section 2.2.1,
Fig. 4
Steps to determine the impact velocity from known initial velocity
v0 and initial diameter d0, using Fig. 4:
Input d0 on horizontal axis.
Move vertically until crossing the violet curve: the terminal
velocity vterminal is found on the violet vertical axis, right, at the same
vertical level.
Identify ratio v0/vterminal of the initial velocity over terminal
velocity on the vertical axis, left.
The ratio of impact velocity over terminal velocity is determined
by the contour value at the intersection of the vertical line passing by
d0 and the horizontal line passing by v0/vterminal.
