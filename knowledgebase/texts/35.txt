1. Introduction
For crime scene investigation in cases of homicide or criminal
assault, the pattern of bloodstains at the incident site is of critical
importance. The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to
determine the approximate blood source locations in forensic
crime reconstructions.
For this approach, up to now, various methods of bloodstain
pattern analysis have been used [1–5]. The stringing method, the
tangent method and the virtual stringing method are by the use of
computer software [6,7]. In the stringing method, the trajectories
of the blood drops are simpliﬁed as straight lines. The impact
directions of the bloodstains are reconstructed by afﬁxing strings
at the position of the bloodstains and pulling them away from the
surface, on which the bloodstain has spilt, in the approximate
impact direction. This direction is determined by the directionality
and relation of the length and width of the elliptical shaped
bloodstain. The approximate location of the blood source is
estimated to be where the majority of strings intersect. In the
tangent method, the ﬂight path of the blood drop is assumed to be a
hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. This method is valid only for
fast-moving blood drops with a ﬂat trajectory before impacting on
the surface. Due to unknown curvatures of the individual ﬂight
path, unknown systematic errors in the horizontal value of the
location of the blood source may occur [2]. The virtual stringing
method
is
equivalent
to
the
traditional
stringing
method
transposed onto the computer.
In the present work, a ballistic analysis to approximate the
trajectories of the blood drops, for the determination of the centres
of origin of the bloodstains, is evaluated.
2. Materials and methods
In the following two cases a three-dimensional bloodstain pattern analysis was
performed.

For crime scene investigation in cases of homicide, the pattern of bloodstains at the incident site is of
critical importance. The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to determine the approximate
blood source locations, the minimum number of blows and the positioning of the victim.
In the present work, the beneﬁts of the three-dimensional bloodstain pattern analysis, including the
ballistic approximation of the trajectories of the blood drops, will be demonstrated using two illustrative
cases.
The crime scenes were documented in 3D, using the non-contact methods digital photogrammetry,
tachymetry and laser scanning. Accurate, true-to-scale 3D models of the crime scenes, including the
bloodstain pattern and the traces, werecreated.For the determination ofthe areas oforigin ofthe bloodstain
pattern, the trajectories of up to 200 well-deﬁned bloodstains were analysed in CAD and photogrammetry
software. The ballistic determination of the trajectories was performed using ballistics software.
The advantages of this method are the short preparation time on site, the non-contact measurement
of the bloodstains and the high accuracy of the bloodstain analysis. It should be expected that this
method delivers accurate results regarding the number and position of the areas of origin of bloodstains,
in particular the vertical component is determined more precisely than using conventional methods. In
both cases relevant forensic conclusions regarding the course of events were enabled by the ballistic
bloodstain pattern analysis.

2.1. Case 1
In a homicide case a woman was attacked by her husband with blunt force to the
head. She was found in a lying position in the bed of their bedroom and died 2 h
later in hospital due to the fatal head injuries. DNA analysis suggested a hammer as
the likely injury-inﬂicting instrument. At the scene of the crime a bloodstain pattern
was found on the ground, wall, ceiling and furniture, as well as bloodstained quilt
and mattress. The pattern on the ground likely resulted from the work of emergency
personnel and as such was no considered further.
The question as to whether the woman was attacked in a sitting or a lying
position was addressed by the bloodstain pattern analysis.
2.2. Case 2
A decomposing male corpse was found in a lying position on the living room ﬂoor
in an apartment. The approximate time of death was 2 weeks previously. The
autopsy ﬁndings included several patterned injuries on the head and three
patterned bone injuries on the skullcap, caused by blunt force.
Bloodstains in the living room were located on the carpet, walls, ceiling and
furniture. Bloodstains were also located on the dinette and on the kitchen. A 3D
match analysis of the cranial bone injuries and the presumed injury-causing tools
located within the apartment concluded that a pistol was used to hit the victim
(http://www.virtopsy.com) [8,9].
The majority of the attacks occurred in the living room. In order to deﬁne other
locations in which the victim was physically attacked, a bloodstain pattern analysis
was performed.
2.3. Basic information about the creation of blood spatter
Blood drops, which ﬂy through the air, are from the ballistic point of view always
spherical [10]. Some oscillation at the beginning of ﬂight can be neglected [11]. In
blood drops produced by blunt force, the diameter of the drops is generally between
1 and 3 mm [2,4]. When a drop with a deﬁned angle of less than 908 strikes a ﬂat
surface, an elliptical bloodstain arises.
The ﬂight distance of blood drops depends on the starting velocity and the cross-
section stress (relation of mass to the cross-section plane). The (initially unknown)
starting velocity cannot overstep a value of something around 10 m/s. This value
can be derived by two physical laws, the ballistic air drag and the surface tension of
the blood drop. When a drop exceeds a certain velocity the pressure due to the air
drag overcomes the internal drop pressure due to the surface tension and the drop
bursts into smaller ones. This threshold velocity depends on the size of the blood
drop and lies between about 10 m/s (for bigger drops, 6 mm) and 17 m/s (for small
drops, 2 mm). Blood drops moving on a parabolic like trajectory must have a quite
smaller velocity because the burst of blood drops due to a too high velocity happen
only in the immediate vicinity of the source.
The mass of the blood drop can be estimated approximately by the diameter
(width of the bloodstain) and the density of blood. This estimation is precise
enough because a 10% error in the mass leads to a distance error of less than
1.5%. When the drop obliquely impacts on the surface, the minor axis of the
elliptical bloodstain can be determined as the diameter of the drop [3]. The
inﬂuence of air resistance is a known factor because of the spherical shape of the
blood drop.
2.4. 3D documentation of the bloodstain pattern and the scene of crime
For the 3D documentation of the scene of crime [12], including the bloodstain
pattern and the traces, we employed a digital close-range photogrammetry system
(Elcovision 10, PMSAG, St. Margreten, Switzerland) and a tachymeter (Leica TPS
405), or a laser scanner (Leica ScanStation 2, Leica Geosystems, Gladherbru¨ ck,
Switzerland) (http://www. leica-geosystems.com).
The digital close-range photogrammetry is a 3D optical coordinate measuring
system that is used to determine precise 3D coordinates of discrete points of an
object. Therefore, several pairs of images are taken from different angles so that
every object point is visible in a photogrammetric image pair. A pair consists of two
images taken from the left and the right-side of the same part of the object (Fig. 1).
For taking the photographs, a calibrated digital reﬂex camera Fuji S3 with a focal
length of 17 and 30 mm is used.
The tachymeter (other term: total station) is a type of theodolite with an electro-
optical laser distance-measuring unit. It is used to determine the terrestrial or
spatial position of points by measuring angles and distances between them. With
the tachymeter, distances are measured to a reﬂector or directly to an object and the
measurements are drawn automatically in 3D CAD software (AutoCAD 2006
software, Autodesk, San Rafael, USA with plug-in ElTheo, PMSAG, St. Margreten,
Switzerland) on a connected laptop at the scene (Fig. 2a).
The 3D laser scanner sends laser beams to the investigation environment whilst
rotating with a horizontal ﬁeld of view of up to 3608 and a vertical ﬁeld of view of up
to 3108. The scanner measures the distances and angles from the reﬂected laser
beams and computes the 3D coordinates of all reﬂected objects to generate a 3D
point cloud consisting of millions of points (Fig. 2b). These point clouds represent
the crime scene in detail and with high accuracy.
The photogrammetric analysis is combined with the scanned data or with the
measurements taken by tachymetry, using reference targets.
With the point clouds of the laser scans or the tachymetry measurements, a true
to scale drawing of the traces and the crime scene in 3D is created using the
AutoCAD 2006 software.
The shapes of the bloodstains are measured and drawn by photogrammetric
analysis using the software Elcovision 10 integrated in the AutoCAD platform. The
result is an accurate, true-to-scale 3D model of the crime scene including the
bloodstain pattern and the traces represented in 2D situation plans and 3D views
(Figs. 3 and 4).

photogrammetric analysis with the tachymetry or laser scanning measurements (yellow arrows). One photogrammetric image pair consists of two images taken from the left
and the right-side of the same part of the object. A blown up detail of the right image (red rectangle) shows well-deﬁned bloodstains.

2.5. Determination of the directions and angles of impact and the centres of origin
The direction of impact and the vertical ﬂight path plane in the room can be
determined by using the angle of impact and the directionality of the bloodstain. The
angle of impact of the blood drop, which is formed between the direction of the blood
drop and the ﬂatsurfacethat is struck, is calculated basedon the relationship between
the length of the major and minor axes of the elliptical bloodstain. In addition, the
directionality of the bloodstain is ascertained from the longitudinal axis of the ellipse
and the direction in which the spin points (Fig. 5). In this manner, the directionality
andlength of the major and minoraxes of the ellipseof all well-deﬁned bloodstains on
walls, ceilings and on furniture that has not been removed are accurately measured.
Based on these measurements, the assumed straight line for the ﬂight path of the
bloodstains is calculated and drawn in the 3D model of the crime scene using CAD
software. To reduce errors in determinating impact angles, only bloodstains with low
impact angles have been considered in the analysis [13–15].
In a top view of the impact directions of the bloodstains, convergence areas are
shown in groups of straight lines in high concentration, which intersect one
another.
These
convergence
areas
are
possible
centres
of
origin
for
the
corresponding bloodstains. In a side view, the height of the centres of origin is
determined by ﬁnding the average intersections of only the straight lines of the
bloodstains which occur at a short distance from the blood source location.
The photogrammetry software Elcovision 10 in combination with the AutoCAD
software performs an automatic calculation of all measured ellipses and draws the
calculated straight lines of the directions of impact of the bloodstains in the 3D
model of the crime scene. Then the centres of origin are determined automatically
by software, or manually, based on the produced 3D model.
2.6. Ballistic determination of the trajectory of the blood spatter
For the determination of the blood source location, the trajectories of
bloodstains, which are of a short distance from the blood drop origin, can be
assumed as straight lines.
In cases of longer distance, a difference in the vertical component between the
spatial direction of impact (in the vertical plane) and the expected centre of origin
arises, because of the curved trajectory of the drop. In these cases a ballistic
determination of the trajectory of a blood drop is performed in order to show
whether these bloodstains arise from the determined centre of origin or from a
different origin.

For the ballistic reconstruction of the blood drop trajectory of a speciﬁc
bloodstain we apply the well-known technique of ballistic trajectory reconstruction
based on the impact condition, as is used in forensic ballistic analysis. These
calculations are only made for bloodstains whose spatial impact direction
contradict the results of the stringing method. For such a blood drop, we know
the horizontal distance to the expected source area (by the stringing method), the
impact angle and its mass. These data determine the angle of departure of the blood
drop within a certain range. We then search for the starting velocity that is
necessary to have the same starting height as the expected source area. If this
velocity is much higher than the possible travelling velocity for blood drops as
explained at Section 2.4, then it is very probable that the bloodstain in question
cannot come from the expected point and we have to look for another source. In the
case where the velocity is lower the mentioned limit, it is quite possible that this
drop came from the expected source.
Trajectory calculations can be done with any exterior ballistics software which
contains the air drag coefﬁcient function of the sphere. We calculated our
trajectories
using
ballistics
software
(k-ballistics
4.0,
Switzerland,
http://
www.kneubuehl.com) [16] (Table 1).
The determined ﬂight paths of the bloodstains are drawn in the 3D model of the
crime scene using CAD software.
3. Results
3.1. Case 1
All analysed bloodstains were located at four or possibly ﬁve
centres of origin. All centres were sited above the pillow, two or
three between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress in the middle of
the pillow (group 1) and two centres on the right-side of the pillow,
closer to the wall and up to 10 cm higher (group 2) (Figs. 6 and 7).
The centres are the possible blood source locations and the groups
the different locations of the head of the victim.
The bloodstains of group 2 overlapped the bloodstains of group
1 (Fig. 8). Therefore, the stains in group 2 arose after those in group
1, which meant that the head of the victim was ﬁrst sited in the
centres of group 1 and then lifted and moved to the centres of
group 2.

3.2. Case 2
Based on the analysed well-shaped bloodstains, the groups of
centres of origin were determined on two additional locations in
the apartment, in the kitchen and in the dinette above a chair.
Group 1 in the kitchen consisted of three centres, marked with
dark and light blue colour (Fig. 9). The centres were sited in the
middle of the kitchen at a height of between 160 and 173 cm, the
dark-blue centres were closer to the fridge and slightly higher than
the light blue centre.
Group 2 in the dinette consisted of one centre (green colour),
which was sited 77 cm above the seat of a chair next to the wall
(Fig. 10). This indicated that the victim sat on the chair whilst being
beaten. In fact, because of the low number of blood spatters, and
their small size, it was presumed that the victim suffered a blow to
the head at an early stage of the attack.
4. Discussion
The approximate areas of origin are mainly used to deduce
whether the victim was standing, sitting or lying down when the
bloodstain pattern was created. In this case, the height of the blood
source locations is of great importance. Using only the classical
stringing method, in cases of longer distance between the blood
source location and the bloodstain, a difference in the vertical
component between the spatial direction of impact and the
expected centre of origin arises because of the curved trajectory of
the drop. A principal task of ballistic analysis of the bloodstain
pattern in these cases is to conﬁrm if these bloodstains are also
from the determined blood source locations. Therefore, the
ballistic determination of the curvature of the ﬂight paths of the
blood drops is of great importance.
[(Fig._6)TD$FIG]
Fig. 6. In the aerial view of the scene, different coloured spheres represent the
convergence areas of the calculated impact directions of the blood spatters (case 1).
These areas of trajectory intersections are the centres of origin of corresponding
bloodstains. Two groups of centres of origin were determined based on up to 150
analysed blood spatters. Both groups were sited above the pillow. The group 1 was
sited between 20 and 25 cm above the mattress, approximately in the middle of the
pillow. This group consisted of three centres, marked by green, yellow and blue
colours. The green and yellow centres were very close together, the blue one was
slightly higher and closer to the wall. The group 2 consisted of two centres, marked
in red and sea-green colour, which were sited between 25 and 35 cm above the
mattress on the right-side of the bed, closer to the wall than the group 1.

of origin.

This study describes a three-dimensional method of bloodstain
pattern analysis including the determination of the trajectory of all
blood spatters, which occur at a far distance from the centre of
origin. Furthermore, in case 1, the determination of the sequence of
events, in which order the bloodstains of the different groups of
areas of origin arose, are ascertained by the overlapping of the
bloodstains.
The advantages of the three-dimensional crime scene docu-
mentation using photogrammetry and laser scanning include the
short preparation time on site and the high accuracy and resolution
for even the smallest bloodstains. These efﬁcient methods are
performed
without contact,
and
if
necessary
or
requested,
everything that is recorded can be measured and drawn in a
CAD program.
In our setup, the ﬁrst photogrammetric images are taken in the
early stages of the investigation, before the deceased is trans-
ported, in order to document the bloodstains before they are
possibly destroyed during the securing of evidence. The complete
crime scene is documented in 3D, after the securing of evidence.
Using the photogrammetry and 3D scanning methods, blood-
stains on vertical, horizontal and oblique surfaces, as well as on
complex shaped objects, can be analysed.
To reduce the random measurement error [13–15], elliptical
shaped bloodstains with low impact angles are analysed and the
shapes of the ellipses are ﬁrst drawn completely and then the
length of the major and minor axes are automatically computed by
the CAD software. Furthermore, the analysis of a large number of
bloodstains is enabled using the computer-based method, which
increases the accuracy of the determined origin of bloodstains and
eliminates the random measurement error.
The 3D documentation methods are easy to use and mobile. For
photogrammetric analysis and creation of 3D models, however, a

misleadingly treated as straight line. The light-blue centre was sited in the middle of the kitchen at a height of about 160 cm and the dark-blue centres were sited closer to the
fridge and between 165 and 173 cm. This indicates that the victim was struck at least twice on the head in a standing position in the kitchen.

fair amount of experience is required. For data interpretation and
the determination of the trajectory of blood drops, advanced
knowledge in physics and ballistics is necessary.
In the conventional stringing or virtual stringing methods, the
height of the areas of origin has always been an inaccurate factor
because the curvature of the trajectories of the blood drops is not
taken into consideration.
The trajectories of bloodstains, which deposit a short distance
from the blood drop origin, can be assumed as straight lines. But,
the results of our method showed that for bloodstains which
deposit at farther distances from the centre of origin, the straight
line is sited higher than the presumed centre of origin. In the case
of bloodstains, which are located longer distance from the blood
drop origin, the straight line was sited up to 2 m higher than the
ballistically determined trajectory of the blood drop in the area of
origin of the bloodstains. These results demonstrate that a ballistic
determination of the trajectories is necessary.
It should be expected that overall, this new method will deliver
a more accurate picture of the number and position of the areas of
origin of bloodstains, the vertical component especially should be
determined more precisely than using conventional methods.
The determined blood spatter directions and trajectories, as
well as the areas of origin of the bloodstains, are rendered into the
virtual true-to-scale 3D crime scene in order to present the results
in a measurable manner.
A general rule to determine which bloodstains should be
analysed by ballistic calculation is given by the angle between the
impact direction and the straight line (in ballistics sciences the so-
called angle of fall). If this angle exceeds 108, ballistic analysis is
recommended.
In
such
cases,
the
difference
between
the
ballistically determined origin of the blood droplet and origin as
calculated by the straight line method is about 18% of the travelled
distance.
To perform such calculations requires a computer program for
ballistic calculation of trajectories that correctly accounts for air
drag as well as some knowledge on the part of the investigator
regarding trajectory reconstitutions. However if a virtual true-to-
scale 3D crime scene is available, it is not necessary for the
investigator to physically visit the crime scene.
5. Conclusions
The results of the ballistic bloodstain pattern analyses gave
clues about the areas of origin, the minimum number of blows, the
positioning of the victim as well as the sequences of events. In both
cases, relevant forensic conclusions regarding crime reconstruc-
tion were enhanced by bloodstain pattern analysis based on 3D
documentation and analysis and the ballistic determination of the
trajectories.
