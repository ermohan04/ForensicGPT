Abstract
There is an apparent paradox that the likelihood ratio (LR) approach is an appropriate 
measure of the weight of evidence when forensic findings have to be evaluated in 
court, while it is typically not used by bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) experts. This 
commentary evaluates how the scope and methods of BPA relate to several types 
of evaluative propositions and methods to which LRs are applicable. As a result of 
this evaluation, we show how specificities in scope (BPA being about activities rather 
than source identification), gaps in the underlying science base, and the reliance on 
a wide range of methods render the use of LRs in BPA more complex than in some 
other forensic disciplines. Three directions are identified for BPA research and train-
ing, which would facilitate and widen the use of LRs: research in the underlying phys-
ics; the development of a culture of data sharing; and the development of training 
material on the required statistical background. An example of how recent fluid dy-
namics research in BPA can lead to the use of LR is provided. We conclude that an 
LR framework is fully applicable to BPA, provided methodic efforts and significant 
developments occur along the three outlined directions.

Highlights
•	 The likelihood ratio is rarely used in bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA), even though this is a 
useful measure of the weight of forensic evidence.
•	 This shortcoming is attributed to specificities in scope and methods and to gaps in the under-
lying science base.
•	 Three lines of efforts in research and training are recommended to promote the use of likeli-
hood ratios in BPA.
•	 We describe how to estimate a likelihood ratio relevant to BPA, based on recent fluid dynam-
ics research.
1  |  INTRODUCTION
In evaluative reporting, there is a current trend to evaluate findings 
based on the concept of likelihood ratio (LR). Recent guidelines rec-
ommending the use of LR have been issued by the UK Association 
of Forensic Science Providers (AFSP) [1], then adapted by the 
European Network of Forensic Science Institutes [2], the National 
Institute of Forensic Science, Australia and New Zealand (NIFS) 
[3], and recently advised by the UK Forensic Science Regulator 
(FSR), the UK Charted Society of Forensic Science, and the Royal

Statistical Society [4]. The later guideline sets a compliance date by 
October 2026.
The present contribution has been motivated by observations 
made in relation to the way BPA findings are reported in court. 
Current reporting practices in BPA rely on a classic approach [5] 
where BPA experts indicate that some of their observations are 
“consistent with” some stated allegations, generally without weigh-
ing the strength of their observations. As Evett et al. summed up [6] 
(p. 237): “At worst, the use of this phrase [consistent with] lays one 
open to the criticism of partiality. At best, it does nothing to convey 
an assessment of the weight of evidence in favor of one or other of 
the stated propositions.”
To the best of our knowledge, attempts to use LRs in BPA are 
very few and very recent: an oral presentation was given by Leon 
Meijrink at the 2019 European Conference of the International 
Association of the Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, with abstract in Ref. 
[7]; Zadora et al. discussed the construction of LRs based on the 
interpretation of spectroscopy measurement, toward evaluating 
the age of dried bloodstains [8–­11]. There is also a current lack of 
guidance on how BPA evaluations should be reported. For instance, 
the Bloodstain Pattern Analysis Subcommittee of the Organization 
of Scientific Area Committees (OSAC) for Forensic Science issued 
in the 2020 ANSI/ASB Standard 031, Standards for Report Writing 
in Bloodstain Pattern Analysis [12]. The document gives guidance 
with regards to the formatting aspects of the reports, but none on 
how the findings should be assessed and reported in the discipline. 
Similarly, another standard on the validation of procedures, ANSI/
ASB 072 “Standard for the validation of procedures in bloodstain 
pattern analysis” [13], has been reported to be vague and unfit for 
purpose [14]. In 2020, the UK FSR added to its code of practice and 
conduct an appendix on BPA [15] that is also silent on how the find-
ings are evaluated and simply refer to the ANSI/ASB Standard 031.
With this contribution, we would like to provide context and 
facts to nurture the debate on a possible migration away from sole 
ipse dixit opinion of the expert to a more structured way of forming 
and expressing opinions. Since LRs are not necessarily used by BPA 
experts, this commentary first describes in detail the LR as a scien-
tific approach to evaluating observations used in different domains 
of forensic science and then explores what the use of LRs would 
entail for BPA.
When used to evaluate forensic findings, the LR, also known 
as the Bayes factor, is the ratio between the probabilities of the 
observations under two competing and mutually exclusive prop-
ositions [16]. The propositions typically represent the contrast-
ing allegations made by the parties, whereas the observations 
are the forensic findings. The LR represents numerically the 
capability of the observations to discriminate two propositions; 
its value indicates which proposition is more supported by the 
observations. The logarithm in base 10 of the LR is also referred 
as the weight of evidence to be assigned to the observations.
There are significant advantages to use LRs in evaluative foren-
sic opinions in court [17]. It forces forensic practitioners to consider 
their findings in the perspective of both the prosecution and the 
defense, rather than, for example, only looking through the prism 
of the thesis of one side. Doing so ensures a balanced approach in 
the sense that results are assessed in a way that considers the al-
legations of both sides. It allows bringing a fair assessment to the 
court whose main duty is to act as a referee between the views of 
each party.
Another advantage of the LR approach is the adherence to a 
logical framework that invites the forensic practitioner to assess 
the probability of the forensic observations under both proposi-
tions, and not the probabilities of the propositions themselves, that 
being the reserved duty of the court. One of the key logical re-
quirements of forensic testimony is indeed to avoid an error known 
as “transposing the conditional” [18] and making sure that the fo-
rensic practitioners reserve their assessments to the observations 
and not to the propositions themselves. This requirement does not 
imply that all practitioners will reach the same LR assignments as 
they may invoke different knowledge, data, and expertise to make 
them, but at least their opinions will withstand scrutiny in a formal 
and logical sense. To achieve consistency in opinions, two mecha-
nisms can be foreseen as identified in the FSR document [4]: a full 
disclosure of the data used by the practitioner and its limitation 
(which is important to transparency), and the regular calibration of 
expert's judgement through, for example, proficiency testing and 
collaborative exercises.
Finally, the LR approach strives toward transparency in the sense 
that the forensic practitioners are invited to describe the data and 
explain the methods and knowledge that contributed to their assign-
ments of probabilities.
There are certainly some difficulties to the use of LRs by forensic 
experts in court. For instance, the use of LRs is grounded on the 
specification of two mutually exclusive propositions representing 
the defense and prosecution allegations. This basic requirement 
is not always met, as, for example, when the defense exercises its 
right to remain silent. Also, the propositions put forth by either the 
defense or the prosecution might change during the course of the 
proceedings.
The availability of at least a pair of propositions (referring re-
spectively to the position of the prosecution and defense) is a pre-­
requisite for evaluative reports, meaning reports that assess the 
observations toward the use in a court of law. In the situation where 
there is no constituted defense proposition or where the defense re-
mains silent, the forensic findings are best presented in a report that 
is more of an investigative nature, offering lines of investigation or 
possible reconstructions, and not through an evaluative report [19]. 
In BPA, we recognize that a lot of activities are investigative in na-
ture and will proceed to evaluation only when clarity on the alleged 
propositions is made. This commentary is primarily concerned with 
the evaluative testimony. Finally, we note that the defense proposi-
tion does not need to be restricted to a single option but may cover 
multiple alleged activities that will be treated separately or jointly as 
shown in Ref. [16].
Nevertheless, the LR approach is recommended by the European 
Network of Forensic Science Institutes [2] for evaluations of forensic

evidence in court and is routinely used for DNA evidence and other 
types of forensic evidence.
2  |  A LIKELIHOOD RATIO CAN BE MORE 
OR LESS COMPLEX TO ASSIGN
The complexity to establish LRs depends on two main factors:
1.	 The method and knowledge used to evaluate the forensic 
observations
As reviewed in Ref. [20], the LR has been used in evaluations 
by forensic experts of various fields to evaluate the relations 
between the evidence and a source, either an individual source 
such as a person of interest in a crime or a set of sources 
sharing common identities such as a brand and model, such 
as pens or cameras.
These evaluations are made either for analysis obtained from 
recovered material traces, where the observations are some 
physicochemical or biological part of the source left at the 
scene, or for pattern or signal evidence, which is an impression 
left either on a physical surface or in a numerical form by 
the source, where the observations will be some geometrical, 
structural, or signal characteristics.
For material traces, source-­based evaluations have been made 
based on chemicals or biological analyses of material traces 
such as ink [21]; gasoline [22] or inflammable liquid [23]; drugs 
[24]; glass fragments [25], and, of course, DNA [26]. All these 
source-­based evaluations relied on statistically assessing the 
importance of similar (or dissimilar) features between the ob-
servations and reference data [23].
For pattern evidence, source-­based evaluations have been de-
veloped, for example, in the areas of fingermarks [27], facial 
images [28], and voice recordings [29] (not a pattern per se 
but an analogue or digital trace).
Most of these source-­based evaluations involve a process where 
features of the recovered specimens are compared with features 
or outputs of a known source, such as handwriting compared 
with the writing of an individual [30], fake identity documents 
(compared with elements from fake document factory [31]), 
or digital images associated with a given camera sensor [32].
Some of the above evaluations involve a mathematical process, 
which quantifies the correspondence of features between ev-
idence and source, and also rely on databases to determine 
how rare the corresponding features are.
The availability of databases is critical to the assignment of 
probabilities to the observations. Indeed, [23] mentions that the 
performance of an LR evaluation depends on several factors, 
including the scarcity of the databases used as populations; the 
mismatch in the conditions of the materials in the population 
databases and in the specimens; and the degraded quality or 
quantity of the materials. Also, approaches based on LRs need 
to be validated, via performance assessments, measurements 
of discriminative power, and calibration [16,23,33]. There are 
two main components that will impact the LR at source level: 
the within-­source variability and the between-­sources variabil-
ity. DNA evidence is among the fields where assignments of 
LRs at source level are the most advanced. The within-­source 
variability is almost null (the DNA profile is stable over the 
lifetime), and the availability of a biological model, coupled with 
known allele frequency data, makes the LR calculation well 
understood, standardized, and widely accepted [34]. For some 
areas (such as glass fragments, fibers, or footwear marks), the 
knowledge associated within-­ and between-­sources variability 
is informed by structured data and documented knowledge.
At this point, it is important to stress that we are discussing 
the likelihood ratio approach as an overarching method useful 
to help the interpretation of forensic observations. It invites 
the forensic practitioner to assess the probabilities of the ob-
servations given one or the other propositions, but we do 
not want to be prescriptive as to how these probabilities (or 
likelihood ratios) should be conveyed. These could either be 
expressed numerically (as advised by the ENFSI guideline [2]) 
or according to the more flexible approach suggested by the 
latest FSR document [4], where only computed likelihood ratio 
based on adequate (or limited) data is reported numerically, 
and a verbal scale is used for qualitative assessments without 
data, solely based on experience.
At times, experts will thus rely more on informed judgement 
than structured datasets, for example, to assess how a feature 
may evolve over time due to the wear of a shoe. By “informed 
judgement,” we mean that the expert relies partly on their 
mental database (examples they have come across in their 
practice, to the extent that they can remember).
The above leads us to suggest a hierarchy of methods and 
knowledge used by forensic scientists to assess their find-
ings. This hierarchy is reported in Figure 1, which may help 
compare the methods and scope of BPA with those of other 
forensic disciplines.
The horizontal axis of Figure 1 is linked to the number of 
variables, nature of data, and expertise required. On the left 
side of the horizontal axis, we have knowledge derived from 
studies, ideally published, and peer-­reviewed, where the rele-
vant features have been systematically measured and studied 
statistically, together with knowledge from models based on 
sciences such as physics, chemistry, or biology. On the right 
side of the horizontal axis, specialists will rely on knowledge 
derived from personal experience, that is, the expert's training 
and professional experience in the forensic technique, up to 
mere opinion (on the extreme right of the axis). The more 
specialists base their assignments of probability on relevant, 
peer-­reviewed, publicly available, and robust data, the greater 
is the trustworthiness of those assignments. The more they 
base their assignments on their recalled experience and knowl-
edge and on their intuition, the more these assignments will 
be open to justified challenge. Indeed, when more and more

informed judgements are called upon, we shift to the right of 
the horizontal axis, toward more complexity. Complexity will 
hence also encapsulate an inherent difficulty to transparently 
explain and assess the process. As one reviewer aptly put 
it: “complexity is associated with the degree of uncertainty 
one faces when assigning probabilities, so naturally, less data 
more complexity.”
2.	 The type of evaluative propositions
Applications of LRs in the context of forensic expertise [20] 
are not only limited to evaluate the relation of the evidence 
with either its source, but also to the associated activities, 
or the offense itself. These three types of propositions are 
what Cook et al. define as the hierarchy of propositions [35], 
explaining that propositions of lower hierarchy (about source) 
are easier to weigh than higher ones (about activity or offense). 
This hierarchy is reflected on the vertical axis of Figure 1.
For the first type of evaluative statement, source-­based evalua-
tions, it is easier to apply LRs to material traces than patterns 
[36], because the material is of similar nature as the source 
(albeit in lower quantity), while patterns involve the printing of 
features from the source to the evidentiary findings, a trans-
fer process that is not always reproducible. As mentioned in 
Ref. [37], “In case of crime scene markings created by one 
object leaving markings of itself on another object—­such as 
a fingerprint onto a surface, a firearm barrel onto a bullet, 
or teeth onto skin—­the faithfulness of the transfer from the 
original to the receiving surface, and the ability of the receiv-
ing surface to retain the impression unchanged, are essential 
to the probativeness of the comparison of the mark on the 
receiving surface to a suspected source.”
The second type of evaluative statements where LRs are used 
involves activity propositions, where it is asked to consider 
the meaning of the forensic observations in the context of 
the activities that led to them. Evaluations of activity add to 
source-­level considerations, the necessity to consider parameters 
such as the transfer and transport (how much material would 
be exchanged under these alleged actions; how far from the 
source would material be found), persistency over time (how 
the material will potentially change, deteriorate, or disappear 
over time), the efficiency of the recovery methods used to 
collect the traces, and the presence by chance of the material 
in the background [35]. Evaluations of activity do not only 
aim at associating evidence to a source, but also, and often 
mainly, consider the spatial motion or temporal modification of 
the evidentiary material. Examples are the assessment of DNA 
findings considering either a direct or a secondary transfer 
[38] or the assessment of fibers [39] or glass [40] if a given 
set of actions occurred. Consideration of activity relies both 
on databases of experimental cases and on models of the 
transport, transfer, or persistence phenomena involved, be they 
physical, chemical, or biological in nature. Again, the models 
need to be validated against well-­designed and available data.
The third type of evaluations relates to judicial matters such as 
the committed offense, which involve, in general, considerations 
outside the domain of expertise of the forensic expert [35].
Therefore, Figure 1 represents the increasing difficulties associ-
ated with the different methods and propositions evaluated with 
LRs. The difficulties increase along the diagonal direction, from 
the “less complex” to the “more complex” realm. Indeed, forensic 
evaluations become more complex with increasing level in the 
hierarchy of propositions, with the unavailability of methods, 
models, and data, and with increasing number of variables that 
may contribute to the assignments of probabilities. To be clear, 
the term “less complex” is not used to mean that any forensic 
evaluation is trivial, but it indicates that in some activities of 
forensic science, the methods of evaluation are established 
and well documented, while in others, practitioners have to 
resort on their personal experience through methods that are 
less documented in the peer-­reviewed literature.
In this commentary, we limit the discussion to the first two 
types of evaluative statements, to which LRs have been applied: 
source-­based and activity-­based.
3  |  WHAT ARE THE EVALUATIVE 
STATEMENTS AND METHODS RELEVANT 
TO BPA?
Let us consider now what type of evaluative statements are ex-
pected from BPA experts, and what methods are used to evaluate 
these statements. To do so, we review, in Table 1, the goals and 
methods of BPA and the forensic discipline that examines traces 
of blood for the purpose of crime scene reconstruction and court 
FI G U R E 1 The diagonal arrow shows that the complexity in 
assigning likelihood ratios increases with, on the vertical axis, the 
hierarchy of propositions (source, activity, and offense), and, on 
the horizontal axis, the method/knowledge used to assign the 
associated probabilities. The approximative core positions of a 
few forensic disciplines are indicated. For BPA, the vertical and 
horizontal arrows estimate the extension of related propositions 
and methods [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

COMMENTARY 
testimony. The table of contents of two successful textbooks on 
BPA helped to prepare Table 1: the book by MacDonell [41] (and 
the associated laboratory manual [42]), which—­while dated—­inspired 
the traditional basic BPA training; and that of a more recent book by 
Bevel and Gardner [43], a recommended reading for the BPA certi-
fication of the International Association for Identification. Table 1 
lists five general BPA topics with their associated methods, goals, 
and type of evaluative statement. Note that the expressed goals 
are borrowed directly from the above textbooks. However, when 
adopting a LR-­based approach, the purpose is not to "determine", 
but to provide a relative assessment of the probabilities associated 
with the observations (the effects) given the alleged propositions 
(the causes).
3.1  |  BPA evaluations of observations are not 
about source, but about activities
Considering that source evaluations are the most current and most 
straightforward applications of the LR in forensic evaluations, we 
can readily answer why LR is rarely used in BPA: LR is rarely associ-
ated with BPA evaluations, because these are essentially activity level 
reporting, as shown in the last column of Table 1. Source evaluations 
are not done in BPA: helping to establish the common origin of a 
bloodstain with its source is a fundamental function of forensic 
genetics but is carried out outside of the traditional scope of BPA. 
Thus, the scope of BPA makes it amenable to LR in a more complex 
way than source-­level evaluations, as per Figure 1. This difficulty 
is also present in the interpretation of patterns considering activity 
level propositions. Patterns such as footwear or fingerprints have 
rarely been assessed in the light of activity level propositions, most 
of the considerations remained about the source. Assigning LRs for 
patterns considering activity level propositions is an emerging foren-
sic topic [44–­46].
Bloodstain pattern analysis indeed focuses on helping towards 
questions of activity, involving either the determination of the 
transport—­that is, the temporal or spatial evolution—­of blood during 
the activity (how far, in what direction, and how long ago), or the 
determination of the type of activity (the cause of a blood pattern).
For instance, BPA analysts are trained at associating patterns 
of millimeter-­sized elliptical stains with broad causes such as spat-
ter events. The “spatter” cause is an abstract category, subsuming 
a wide variety of causes such as spitting blood, stepping in a blood 
pool, hitting a person with a bullet, and snapping bloody fingers. 
These spattering events have also completely different character-
istics (velocity, impulse, and shape of the impactor) than the re-
sulting distribution of sizes and shapes of the stains in the pattern. 
Determination of activity based on inspection of stain patterns is 
thus a process where the observations are associated with an ab-
stract cause, rather than the association of evidence with class char-
acteristics. Class characteristics associate evidence of the kind of 
blood type, fibers, or paint with a given set of individual sources, as 
bullets with specific marks can be associated with a gun model. The 
recommendations for courtroom testimony in Ref. [43] mention that 
bloodstain pattern analysis is a “class characteristic” process. This 
definition may apply to a small subset of blood patterns called trans-
fer patterns, which may share characteristics of an object involved 
in the creation of the blood trace, such as the weaves of a cloth or 
the ridges of a finger. However, for most blood patterns, the associ-
ation of a blood pattern with its cause is not a class characteristics 
process, because there is typically little-­to-­no comparable features 
between the blood pattern and its cause.
3.2  |  BPA evaluations rely on a wide range of 
methods and a complex science base that is still 
being built
Classification of findings with respect to their cause can certainly be 
done by considering similarities between features of the evidentiary 
observations and features of known data produced by a given cause. 
This task is more difficult than classification by similar features be-
tween questioned and known samples of the same kind, because 
establishing the database requires the design of experiments pro-
ducing samples based on the set of causes of interest. Firing a model 
of gun (the cause) and collecting the bullets (the findings) might be 
a relatively simple example of matching an effect to a cause, in the 
sense that the striations on the bullet might match striation patterns 
of the barrel of the weapon, or match the striations on other bul-
lets fired by the same model of gun. In BPA, the task of designing 
experiments corresponding to the specific abstract cause of spat-
ter generation will involve generating events involving, for example, 
somebody coughing blood, firing bullets, simulating the motion of 
fists, rods hitting blood pools or body parts, at a variety of velocities, 
and along different orientations and directions [47,48]. To be repre-
sentative of all the possible outcomes of these causes, the param-
eters of the experiments need to be chosen according to a scientific 
knowledge of the associated transport phenomena, so that no sig-
nificant region of the design parameter space is omitted. This is dif-
ficult to do whether the relationship between cause and effect is not 
well understood, because of, for example, scientific knowledge gaps 
in the underlying fluid dynamics. In a related way, [36] describes the 
purpose of BPA in contrast to the identification and classification 
problems presented above. It describes BPA as an attempt to infer 
causes from observed evidence: “Forensic examiners in disciplines 
like crime scene investigation, arson, and blood spatter analysis at-
tempt to reconstruct a crime based on evidence found at the crime 
scene, which can be viewed as attempts to infer the causes of ob-
served effects. This can be a challenging task because it is difficult 
to carry out realistic controlled experiments that would allow one to 
reliably distinguish between competing explanations (e.g., fires that 
develop naturally versus those using an accelerant). Statistical col-
laboration with practitioners in relevant disciplines will be valuable 
in strengthening inferences in these settings.” Similarly, [35] also 
mentions the inherent difficulty in generating statistical data based 
on a cause such as “kicking bleeding bodies”: “However, this is not

COMMENTARY 
a straightforward matter to deal with: it is similar to the issues that 
arise in reconstruction problems, a subject which will be left to a 
future paper.” Also, for the purpose of peer review, the databases are 
better made publicly available. Recent studies [49–­52] have shown 
that classification in BPA typically has error rates of about 10%. 
These numbers are difficult to interpret, because the data used in 
the studies are not publicly available. Recently, a larger study [53] 
confirmed the above error rates, while providing more information 
on the data and methods. Let us stress that a reduction in the error 
rates by several orders of magnitude is needed to make the related 
analyses and LRs significant in court. Considering both of these di-
mensions (level on the hierarchy and nature of the knowledge used), 
it is clear that assignment of LR in BPA is in the complex realm. Thus, 
BPA specialists currently borrow more from their personal experi-
ence than from structured and published data.
4  |  PROPOSITION OF THREE DIRECTIONS 
TO FACILITATE THE USE OF LRS IN BPA
Despite the inherent difficulty that the scope of BPA is about activi-
ties rather than source, it seems possible to develop BPA along the 
three directions below to facilitate and widen its use of LRs. Note 
that, a clear benefit of the proposed directions is to root the BPA 
assessment in a logical and transparent process, a form of evidence-­
based assessment more than opinion-­based.
4.1  |  Proposed direction 1: Better understand the 
physics associated with BPA
The branch of physics describing the complex events connecting 
the cause of a blood pattern and the pattern itself is called fluid 
dynamics. It describes how a bullet atomizes blood; how the im-
pact of a fist on a moving face squeezes and splashes blood; how 
airborne droplets move along trajectories curved by gravity and 
slowed by drag; and how drops spread, wick, and dry onto ma-
terials as complex as fabrics. Only recently, peer-­reviewed fluid 
dynamic studies have started to uncover the complex physics 
underlying BPA [54–­72]. The governing equations of fluid dynam-
ics are called the Navier–­Stokes equations; they are the expres-
sion of Newton's second law for fluids. These equations involve 
nonlinear and dissipative terms. As their name suggests, nonlin-
ear terms such as inertial forces exhibit a nonlinear relationship 
between cause and effect. Linear extrapolations of uncertainties 
from experiments under specific conditions to casework involving 
different conditions may therefore lead to large, unknown errors. 
Nonlinearity thus makes the design of experiments and databases 
complicated. Effects of dissipative terms such as viscous dissipa-
tion or species diffusion are that information about the initial con-
ditions of a bloody event may be lost during the evolution of the 
resulting blood pattern. Even the rheology of blood, the descrip-
tion of the fundamental mechanisms by which viscous dissipation 
occurs, is a topic of current studies [65,73,74]. It is currently not 
fully clear whether the blood substitutes used for BPA research 
and training behave like fresh blood [74] in several situations of 
interest. These difficulties currently limit the ability to reconstruct 
(going backward in time to identify the causes) a crime scene and 
to provide corresponding evaluative statements.
For instance, one could argue that information on the average 
size of the stains would tell whether a spatter is caused by a gunshot 
or the impact of, for example, a baseball bat. This argument has been 
made [41] in the past. It has been recently shown that this distinction 
is not straightforward [75], and even quite inaccurate in situations 
involving muzzle gases interacting with droplets [76]. Certainly, a 
deeper knowledge of the physics involved (as per horizontal axis of 
Figure 1) would improve the ability to associate patterns with their 
physical cause.
4.2  |  Proposed direction 2: Create public 
databases of BPA patterns, and/or make existing 
databases public
There is tradition and increased trend in various scientific disciplines 
to make data publicly, freely, and widely available, but this is not 
yet the case in BPA. Only few BPA databases are publicly available 
[53,77–­80]. Similarly, lots of peer-­reviewed BPA studies produce 
conclusions on the basis of bloodstain pattern data that are not ac-
cessible. The open sharing of data is useful for peer review and nec-
essary to support the determination of rarity and significance of a 
conclusion. Developing a culture of sharing and publishing BPA data, 
either scattered, specific, or organized in databases, will contribute 
to an open science attitude that is much needed in forensic science 
[81]. This effort may not only involve experimental results from 
forensic researchers, but also involve casework data from forensic 
practitioners.
4.3  |  Proposed direction 3: Develop BPA training 
material that discusses the likelihood ratio and its 
related statistical foundations
The widely used BPA book by James et al. [5] does not mention 
the concept of likelihood ratio and recommends to perform ex-
periments to demonstrate that traces are “consistent” with an 
activity, involving blood transfer, swinging a bloody object, tim-
ing of the event, a beating, blows, or stab wounds, a given posi-
tion of a victim raising their arms, or high velocity spatter. Doing 
so gives BPA the role of supporting one of either the prosecu-
tion or the defense theses, without assigning weight to the find-
ings in the context of both propositions. Indeed, the chapter on 
court testimony in Ref. [5] mentions that experts often influence 
a verdict and remind the reader that the weight of the evidence 
is decided by the jury or judge. The uncertainty is presented in 
a binary manner: “Remember not every question derived from

COMMENTARY 
the bloodstain patterns will have a definitive answer”, rather than 
along the more realistic probabilistic spectrum. The textbook by 
Bevel and Gardner does not mention the likelihood ratio either 
[43]. In their chapter on court testimony, the word uncertainty 
is not mentioned. The closest is a discussion about the determi-
nation of angles of impact from stain inspection, where the au-
thors mention error rates while possibly meaning uncertainty. The 
chapter also involves a statement mistrusting the legal system and 
overvaluing the work of the bloodstain pattern analysis: “It is clear 
and apparent that the legal system as a whole has forgotten that 
truth is truth.”
Approaches based on LRs may take years to propagate into the 
methods used in crime scene reconstruction and court testimony: 
the culture of certainty needs to change; new methods need to be 
designed and validated based on research findings; the associated 
uncertainties need to be quantified; practitioners need to be trained 
to the new methods; and standards of accreditation need to account 
for these changes.
5  |  EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF LR IN BPA
Since BPA is about activities involving reconstructed measure-
ments (such as time and location), this creates opportunities to 
apply LRs in BPA. Remember that the LR applies to any situation 
where the observations are weighted against each other in the 
light of two propositions whatever these are. Careful inspection of 
the first column of Table 1 shows that many topics of BPA inves-
tigations are not about quantifying the likelihood of one proposi-
tion, but rather about providing a measurement, such as a location 
(rows #1, 2), speed (#2), volume (#4), or time (#5) and its meaning 
in the context of the alleged circumstances. The opportunity to 
use measurements to evaluate LRs can be illustrated by the re-
cent work by Smith et al. [54]. In a laboratory setting, they esti-
mated the time duration t between the generation of a blood pool 
and the observation of the drying blood pool via high-­resolution 
photographs. They developed a physical model that estimates t 
based on the following evidential observations: time-­stamped 
photographs, with scale, of the shape, size of the blood pool, na-
ture of the surface on which the blood pool resides, and climate 
measurements. While the study acknowledges that “many ques-
tions remain” [54], the proposed estimate is based on a physical 
model established from transport equations that describe how a 
complex fluid like blood flows, and how the mass and temperature 
of the blood pool evolve. While the data and results are currently 
preliminary, a detailed data collection plan is presented to quan-
tify the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the time. 
Let us fast forward a few years and assume that these additional 
developments of the method have been successfully done; that 
the assumption of normality has been verified; that uncertainty 
has been quantified; and that the model can be applied to crime 
scenes. Assume that such model applied to a given crime scene 
estimates the time t = 480 min ± a*18 min, where we set a = 1 to 
obtain a 68.27% confidence interval (based on normality). If the 
proposition of the prosecution (Hp) is that t < 7 h (420 min), and 
that of the defense that t > 7 h (Hd), it would be easy to express 
the likelihood ratio of the evidence under either proposition (see 
also [82]). The LR is
This value of the LR means that the findings are 2330 times more 
likely if the defense proposition is true than if the prosecution prop-
osition is true.
Note that a frequentist approach is used in the above illustration 
about how LRs can be used in BPA. While the use of LRs in forensic 
science has often been associated with a Bayesian approach to sta-
tistics, there is no requirement to assign LRs using a full Bayesian 
methodology. For instance, the above illustrative example does not 
require the determination of a prior, the value of which is rarely 
universally accepted. Besides illustrating how LRs can be used in 
BPA, the above discussion on Ref. [54] illustrates how the scientific 
method (here fluid dynamics and experiment design) helps deter-
mine the data that need to be collected. Indeed, without knowledge 
of the intricacies of the complex, multistage, and multidimensional 
drying process of a complex fluid like blood, a brute force data col-
lection approach might not have identified the relevant data to col-
lect (here the ratio of wet vs. total area of the pool and its perimeter) 
and might not have been able to subsume those contributions in 
a single algebraic equation based on physical principles. Note also 
that, physics-­based methods such as the use of dimensionless num-
bers can reduce the amount of data to collect by several orders of 
magnitude [66,83].
Similar considerations can be done regarding the determination 
of the height of a blood source, or its distance from a wall, as long 
as the reconstructed measurement is provided in a physically and 
statistically sound way [60,84]. These illustrations show that the LR 
applies to BPA, at least in principle. Finally, LR approaches may be 
developed on the sole basis of extensive and representative statis-
tical analysis of findings associated with real casework, such as the 
survey by Briggs for extraneous blood on clothing [85].
6  |  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
We conclude that the LR framework is applicable to BPA, but that 
it is a complex task to do. A structural reason for this complexity 
is the scope of BPA, which is about evaluations at the level of ac-
tivities rather than source. A conjectural reason is about the state 
of the art of BPA-­related fundamental knowledge, data, and train-
ing material. To facilitate applications of LR in BPA evaluations, it 
is proposed to develop the discipline along three directions: better 
physical understanding, solid and available data, and appropriate 
training. As an example relevant to BPA, thoughts are presented on
