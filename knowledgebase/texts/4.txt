The aim of examining the forward spatter bloodstain patterns of gunshot wounds is to accurately describe the 
relationship between the victim, the culprit, and the crime scene. The purpose of this study is to determine the 
approximate location of the blood source, i.e. the victim, at the crime scene by using an image processing and 
numerical modeling approach. To achieve this, an experimental setup is designed with cardstocks and a cow 
blood-soaked sponge. In total, twenty forward spatter patterns are obtained onto cardstocks after successful 
shootings. In the post-processing phase, ellipses on the cardstocks are detected by processing the forward spatters 
in MATLAB. To achieve this, ellipse properties are identified for calculating the impact angles. The impact angles 
are then utilized as inputs to the tangent method within the program to estimate the Area of Origin (AOx). For 
visualization, 2D and 3D images are generated. In conclusion, it is observed that the program works the best in 
determining the AOx, for the scenarios where the real AOx distances (blood source to target distances) are 35 cm, 
50 cm, and 100 cm respectively. The program’s weakness while determining AOx for the source distance of 5 cm 
is also reported. It is necessary to improve the program for short blood source-to-target distances and long 
shooting distances. It can be concluded that image quality is also a key factor for post-processing as it might 
mislead the results with visible ellipses.
1. Introduction
Bloodstains are one of the most significant types of physical evidence 
and can greatly help to establish the connection between the culprit, the 
victim, and the crime scene. The formation of the stains depends on 
physical, environmental, and biological factors and can appear in 
various sizes and forms [1]. Patterns resulting from a force applied 
directly to the source of blood are referred to as impact spatter. Such 
spatters may be caused by firearms, blunt objects, stabbing, electrical 
devices, or explosions [1]. The size of bloodstains is typically less than 
1 mm or larger, and the velocity of the applied force can start at 30 m/s. 
However, there is no direct correlation between stain size and the ve­
locity of the applied force [2]. By analyzing the spatter bloodstains, the 
following questions can be answered regarding the crime scene: 
• Possible location and position of the culprit, the victim, and other 
objects at the scene
• Chronological order of events
• Verification or refutation of statements made by the victim, wit­
nesses, or culprit
There are a variety of software and algorithms developed in the 
literature for the location of the blood source, i.e. Area of Origin (AO) 
estimation in bloodstain pattern analysis [3]. The aim of these methods 
is to estimate AO based on the size, shape and directionality of blood­
stains. The string method is a well-known traditional method that uses 
physical strings to determine the AO. This method is time-consuming, 
and its accuracy depends on the performer. Modern approaches use 
primarily image processing and numerical modeling. The currently 
available and most used programs include HemoSpat, Sherlock, Back­
Track, HemoVision, FARO Scene [3]. In the study by Arthur et al. 
MATLAB was used to analyze bloodstain patterns. Digital images were 
processed and basic features such as eccentricity, major and minor axis 
lengths, orientation, area and center of mass were calculated using the 
regionprops function. The methodology involved preparing digital im­
ages, isolating the bloodstains by applying segmentation and

morphological processing, and then using these features to calculate the 
impact angles and determine the Area of Convergence (AC) [4].
2. Material and methods
2.1. Experimental setup
In this study, bloodstain patterns formed by forward spatter on flat, 
plain, and light- colored surfaces due to gunshot wounds are investi­
gated using image processing and numerical modeling methods. For the 
experimental setup (Figs. 1 and 2), the blood used for both back spatter 
and forward spatter is aimed to mimic human blood. Thus, cow blood is 
selected as the most suitable option based on the literature review [5]. 
Soft sofa sponges, measuring 13x10x7 cm, are soaked to absorb 50 ml of 
EDTA-anticoagulated cow blood each are then utilized during shootings. 
In various studies, white cardboard has been used as a target surface to 
observe the resulting forward spatter bloodstain patterns [6–11]. Sub­
sequently, bloodstain images were taken with a Canon EOS 1200D 
camera using an 18–55 mm lens. The shooting settings were adjusted 
based on lighting conditions to ensure image clarity, with an aperture of 
f/4.5, a shutter speed of 1/100 s, and an ISO of 6400. The images were 
recorded at a resolution of 3368 × 4776 pixels with a bit depth of 24 and 
a DPI of 72.
2.2. Image processing algorithm & analysis
The MATLAB code for this study is based on the numerical calcula­
tion of the AO of a bloodstain pattern on a flat and light-colored surface 
at the crime scene by processing an image containing bloodstains. The 
code initially receives a bloodstain pattern image from the user. In the 
case of a colored image, the code converts it to black-and-white for 
better identification of the stains. Later, it converts the image to binary 
format so that the bloodstains appear as white on a black background. 
With the ‘regionprops’ function, the code analyzes each of the ellipses in 
the image and calculates their major and minor axis lengths, eccen­
tricities, centroids, and areas. Using these features, it selects bloodstains 
that are small, elliptical, and within a certain size range (the minimum 
area for selected ellipses is 5-pixel, whereas the maximum area for 
selected ellipses is 500-pixel) so that only the appropriate stains are 
utilized in the analysis.
By utilizing the discussed methodology, a set of cardstocks that are 
the outcome of the experiment which are the combination of different 
real AOx distances and different shooting distances are analyzed. The 
real AOx distances are 5 cm, 35 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm while the

shooting distances are 0 cm, 5 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm respectively. 
Thus, a total of 20 forward spatter patterns are obtained, then, these 
images are post-processed with MATLAB.
2.3. Impact and gamma angles
The angle of impact (θ), a crucial factor in bloodstain pattern anal­
ysis, refers to the angle at which blood drops strike a surface. The 
appearance of the bloodstain varies with changes in the impact angle. 
Perpendicular impacts produce circular shapes, while at more oblique 
angles the ellipse appears more elongated [12]. 
θ = sin−1
(width
length
)
#
(1) 
In Eq. (1), “width” refers to the minor axis of the ellipse, while 
“length” denotes the major axis. In bloodstain analysis, gamma angle, 
known as directional angle, is an important indicator to identify the 
direction of movement of the blood drop with relative to a reference axis 
(typically a horizontal or a vertical plane) [13]. It is calculated by 
considering the orientation and direction of movement of the stain. For 
example, if a stain is tilted at 45 degrees and the droplet moved to the 
right, the gamma angle is 45 degrees. If the same stain resulted from a 
droplet moving to the left, the gamma angle would be 225 degrees (180 
degrees in the opposite direction). By looking at both the gamma angle 
and the impact angle, analysts can estimate where the blood drops came 
from before it hit the surface, helping to find the source of the bloodstain 
[12]. However, this estimation does not consider other forces like 
gravity and air resistance.
2.4. Method for area of origin calculation
There are various methods in the literature such as tangent method, 
stringing, automated tangent method, least squares angles for analyzing 
the ellipse models formed and determining the area of origin. The 
tangent method and string stretching are mostly manual methods [3, 
14]. In order to understand the tangent method, it is necessary to 
understand how to determine the AO. As a result of examining each of 
the bloodstains formed because of the Impact Mechanism, the impact 
angle is obtained.
In the first stage of the tangent method, the intersection points of the 
lines drawn and extended from the major axes of the ellipses are 
analyzed in a pairwise manner. Then, the intersection region is deter­
mined, and the Y and Z coordinates of the AO are determined. The 
second stage is to find the X coordinate by applying the tangent rule. In 
this stage, first, the distance Di, which is the projection of each ellipse to 
the intersection region, is determined as shown in Fig. 4. Then, the 
length and width of the ellipse are used to determine the impact angle 
(θi) [14]. 
AOy = 1
n
∑n
i=1(Di⋅tan(θi) )#
(2) 
As shown in Eq. (2), multiplying the distance to the intersection Di by 
the tangent of the calculated impact angles gives us the total distance 
perpendicular to the target surface. Since the calculated value contains 
information from all ellipses, we then divide the found value by the total 
number of ellipses (n) to come up with the X coordinate of the Area of 
Origin (AOx) [14].
Note that, Area of Origin in this case refers to a point since the Area of 
Origin is defined as "The space in three dimensions to which the trajectories 
of spatter can be utilized to determine the location of the spatter producing 
event " [13]. For the scope of this study, coordinates AOy and AOz are not 
calculated intentionally due to the experimental setup. Since, the 
experiment is set up in a way that the source is placed globally (AOx, 0, 
0). That means, the source is placed perpendicular to the origin point of 
the cardstock. Thus, finding the remaining two coordinates other than 
AOx is an unnecessary effort.
As a result of each analysis, the estimated source distance is calcu­
lated with supporting 2D graphics where detected ellipses and impact 
angles are shown (Figs. 5), and 3D graphics where the AOx is shown 
(Fig. 6). For convenience, details of a single case study in which the 
source to target distance is 35 cm and shooting distance is 0 cm is 
presented.
In forensic practice, analysts determine whether the observed 
bloodstains are more circular (eccentricity close to 0) or more elongated 
(eccentricity close to 1) before inputting a suitable minimum and 
maximum eccentricity range. Once these values are provided, the al­
gorithm further optimizes the selection by prioritizing the most 
frequently occurring eccentricity values within the image, ensuring that

the selected stains best represent the dominant pattern and minimizing 
error (Table 1). The minimum and maximum eccentricity value where 
the calculated distance is closest to the actual distance is shown in 
Table 2 by applying the narrowing process. With the minimum 0.00 and 
maximum 0.57 eccentricity values, the X coordinate of the blood source 
(AOx) is found to be 34.8607 cm, which has a −0.40 % error relative to 
the actual source-to-target distance of 35 cm. The same process is 
applied to the remaining data sets as well. A more detailed discussion of 
the analysis results for all cases is provided in Section 3.

in the MATLAB program. Unlike blunt trauma, which is commonly 
analyzed in the literature, we focused on bloodstain patterns caused by 
high-velocity impact. This made detection and analysis challenging due 
to the image quality, complex patterns, and the presence of very small 
bloodstains.
In cases where the blood source and the target are separated by 5 cm, 
significant errors that are exceeding 100 % are seen. This is due to lack 
of quality of the image which causes complex patterns and small size 
ellipses that are hard to detect by the program. For these reasons, the 
ellipses are not detected with a blood source distance of 5 cm and a 
shooting distance of 100 cm. Thus, the estimated source distance is 
assigned as NA and not included in the calculation.
In cases where the blood source and the target are separated by 
35 cm, the calculated distances showed minimum errors ranging from 
−0.40–2.37 %. This indicates that the code performs the best at this 
distance. The average optimized maximum eccentricity value of 0.66 
received from the user is effective for accurate AO estimation at this 
distance.
In cases where the blood source and the target are separated by 
50 cm and 100 cm, the errors are mostly below 2 %. At the longer dis­
tance of 100 cm source to target distance, when the shooting distances 
are 50 cm and 100 cm, the calculation could not be performed due to 
inadequate ellipses, which are assigned as NA and excluded from the 
calculation.
It is seen that as the source to target distance increases the maximum 
eccentricity value to be utilized decreases. This can be explained with 
the nature of bloodstain formation. At longer source distances, most 
ellipses are expected to have low eccentricity values considering that 
bloodstains will hit at an impact angle closer to 90̊ , while at shorter 
distances, more elliptical bloodstains are produced when they hit at 
narrower angles and the eccentricity values of the ellipses are expected 
to be high. Therefore, to get the majority of the ellipses to be detected in 
photographs, these ellipses should be selected within a certain range of 
eccentricity values. A bloodstain pattern analyst is expected to deter­
mine whether the visible ellipses in the image are generally more cir­
cular or elongated and estimate an appropriate maximum eccentricity 
value accordingly. This input helps ensure that the selected range aligns 
with the dominant ellipse stains in the bloodstain distribution.
As a result, the code is observed to perform more effectively in 
analyzing the location of the blood source for bloodstains originating 
from distances of 35 cm and 50 cm. The code requires improvement for 
cases involving short source to target distances and long shooting dis­
tances. Factors such as image quality, and the appearance of mist- 
patterned stains should also be considered for more precise results. 
Thus, with future enhancements such as adding physical factors like 
drag and gravity correction, as well as automating eccentricity limita­
tions, this program has the potential to become an effective tool for both 
academic research and crime scene investigations.
4. Discussion
In the literature, the majority of the studies have analyzed blood 
stain patterns resulting from blunt force trauma with low and medium 
velocity impact on the blood source [14] [3]. In contrast, in this study, 
spatter bloodstain patterns resulting from gunshot wounds or deaths, 
which are in the high-velocity impact group, are analyzed. This partic­
ular type of analysis has made the study more challenging since 
high-velocity impact patterns on the target surface usually result in the 
formation of a mist pattern that consists of unevenly distributed and 
extremely tiny ellipses. The numerical algorithm developed in MATLAB 
within the scope of the research utilizes the tangent method. The pro­
gram requires several inputs from the user such as the minimum and 
maximum eccentricity limits, and minimum and maximum areas of the 
ellipses to be analyzed. These inputs are crucial in terms of excluding 
ellipses that will mislead the calculation. Once the user provides an 
initial eccentricity range, the algorithm systematically evaluates multi­
ple ranges and optimizes the selection by prioritizing the most 
frequently occurring eccentricity values within the image. This 
data-driven approach helps minimize errors and improve accuracy. The 
current state of the program does not account for the effect of gravity 
and assumes that blood drop flight paths are linear, which impacts the 
precision of the calculated source distances. In reality, blood droplets are 
subject to gravitational pull, which introduces a downward curve to 
their trajectory. This means that the actual Area of Origin (AO) may lie 
slightly above the estimated point, especially at longer source-to-target 
distances. Air resistance can also influence the flight path by slowing 
down smaller droplets during motion, potentially affecting their final 
position on the surface. While improvements such as automating the 
selection of eccentricity limits are already being considered, future 
versions of the algorithm may also benefit from incorporating simple 
physical corrections. These could include modeling the parabolic path of 
a droplet under gravity or adjusting the analysis based on expected 
travel distance changes due to air drag. Integrating 3D surface mapping 
or applying correction factors based on surface characteristics may also 
improve accuracy in more complex scenes. These developments remain 
open for future research and are not limited to the scope of this study.
When compared to existing bloodstain analysis software such as 
BackTrack™, HemoSpat, and Sherlock, the proposed algorithm offers 
both advantages and limitations. BackTrack™ and HemoSpat are widely 
used tools that provide visual modeling and include physical corrections 
such as gravity and air resistance. However, they often operate as closed 
systems and give the user little control over the internal parameters. 
HemoSpat also supports analysis on angled surfaces, but its accuracy can 
drop when analyzing stains from long distances. Sherlock is mainly used 
for educational purposes and has limited application in real-world 
forensic scenarios [3]. In contrast, the algorithm developed in this 
study allows for more user interaction and transparency, especially in 
controlling which stains are included in the analysis. This makes the 
method particularly adaptable for high-velocity cases such as gunshot 
wounds. On the other hand, it currently assumes straight-line trajec­
tories and does not include surface orientation or air resistance, which 
may reduce accuracy in some conditions. It also struggles with very 
short source-to-target distances, where the mist-like stains are hard to 
detect due to their small size and inconsistent shape. One potential so­
lution is to improve the current ellipse detection algorithm by inte­
grating more advanced image processing techniques, which may help 
distinguish smaller stains from background noise. Additionally,

pre-processing filters like contrast enhancement could be applied to 
improve stain visibility in low-quality images. Incorporating machine 
learning-based stain recognition, trained on annotated spatter datasets, 
may also improve reliability at short distances. These enhancements will 
be considered in future studies to improve the algorithm’s performance 
in challenging scenarios. Despite the challenges, the algorithm has 
demonstrated high accuracy at mid-range distances and offers a clear 
framework that can be extended and refined in future studies.
5. Conclusions
In this study, an algorithm for image processing and bloodstain 
pattern analysis is developed considering its importance in describing 
the relationship between the victim, the culprit, and the crime scene. 
The code is developed to be capable of determining the approximate 
area of origin of the blood, i.e. the victim, by utilizing an image of the 
crime scene including the bloodstains. This study differs from the 
literature in the sense that it includes high-velocity impact cases such as 
firearm related incidents rather than low and medium velocity impact 
cases such as blunt force trauma in which a lot of resources in the 
literature are available [3,14]. The method that is employed in this 
study, called the tangent method, requires the impact angle of the 
bloodstains to be calculated. This is achieved via extracting the prop­
erties of the ellipses that are fitted onto bloodstains in the images. With 
the impact angle calculated, estimated source to target distance can be 
calculated. Detailly discussed methodology is applied to a set of card­
stocks that are obtained after the experiment. The experiment consists of 
different source to target distances and different shooting distances that 
are (5 cm, 35 cm, 50 cm 100 cm) and (0 cm, 5 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 
100 cm) respectively. Obtained 20 forward spatter bloodstain patterns 
are analyzed. It should be noted that the code requires user input for 
minimum and maximum ellipse eccentricities and areas. This would 
narrow down the ellipses to be analyzed for better converged solutions. 
Results show that the algorithm performs the best in the source to target 
distances that are 35 cm and 50 cm with errors to actual distances are 
less than 1 % in general. For the source the target distance of 100 cm, 
the errors are still small as the maximum calculated error is 2.77 %. For 
source the target distance of 5 cm, the errors are huge, exceeding 100 %, 
due to lack of image quality and existence of extremely small ellipses. In 
addition, for each source to target distance, an optimum minimum and 
maximum eccentricity value is selected. It can be concluded that as the 
source to target distance increases, the optimum value for maximum 
eccentricity decreases. Since at longer distances, the majority of the 
ellipses have low eccentricity values due to high impact angles yielding 
90̊ , utilizing a smaller maximum eccentricity value would enable the 
code the select the more circular bloodstains. With the same approach, 
as the distance becomes smaller, the impact angle becomes narrower 
which yields higher maximum eccentricity values, more elliptic blood­
stains, are more appropriate. This study can be further improved via 
automizing the eccentricity and area selection process and training it 
with better prepared data sets such as wider range of source to target 
distances and shooting distances that are photographed better. This 
would help this algorithm and so does this study to be a go-to tool in 
bloodstain pattern analysis in academia and crime scene investigations.
