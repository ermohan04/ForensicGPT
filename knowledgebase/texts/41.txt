Experimental Physiology : Translation and Integration
Much interest has focused on comparative haemorheological
studies (Amin & Sirs, 1985; Johnn et al. 1992; Waugh,
1992; Windberger et al. 1993/1994; Kumaravel & Singh,
1995; Baskurt, 1996; Baskurt et al. 1997, 2000; Bäumler et
al. 2001). Despite being similar in basic structure and
serving equally important physiological functions in all
mammals, red blood cells differ vastly in their rheological
properties in different species. Comparative studies are
designed to give relevant information on the structural and
functional basis of red blood cell rheological behaviour
itself. Information gathered in comparative studies can
thus serve as a basis for experimental models investigating
flow phenomena in different animal species.
Blood viscosity contributes to endothelial shear stress
(Barakat, 2001). Shear stress modulates the orientation of
endothelial cells in the direction of flow and to the
‘waviness’ of the luminal surface of the vessel (Davies,
1995). In addition, shear stress influences the arterial
diameter (Johnson et al. 1981) through the release of
endothelial vasoactive factors such as nitric oxide,
endothelin-1 and prostaglandin I2 (Frangos et al. 1985;
Moncada et al. 1991; Malek & Izumo, 1992) and affects
arterial remodelling (Langille & O’Donnel, 1986; Sumpio
et al. 1990). However, endothelial shear stress, which is
influenced by fluid viscosity and blood flow, might not be
uniform between the animal species. In diseases with
elevated levels of whole blood and plasma viscosity (Linke,
1996), endothelial shear stress will be even further altered.
The available data are so far only of limited use. This is
partly due to the small number of animals and species

In this study species-specific values for whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV) and erythrocyte
aggregation (EA) were determined in a total of 360 animals. We used 40 individual adult animals of nine
mammalian species: horse, pig, dog, cat, rat, cattle, sheep, rabbit and mouse. WBV measurements were carried
out using a LS30 viscometer, PV was measured using OCR-D and EA was measured using a Myrenne
aggregometer and the LS30 (aggregation index at low shear rate). At low shear rates (0.7 s_1 and 2.4 s_1)
haematocrit (Hct)-standardized (40% Hct) samples showed a higher value of WBV and EA in horse, pig, dog
and cat. In cattle, sheep, rabbit and mouse, EA and WBV were markedly decreased and EA was almost
undetectable, although the plasma fibrinogen concentration was higher in these animals. Rats showed the
highest WBV at low shear rate in native blood and WBV was not different from horse in Hct-standardized
blood; however, EA was very low in the rat, a result that might be explained by mechanical or geometrical
properties of the red blood cell. EA correlated with the plasma protein concentration in each species except dog
and mouse. In horse, cattle and pig, EA correlated with the plasma fibrinogen concentration. At high shear rate
(94 s_1), WBV was higher in cattle than cat and rat, and dog had higher values than horse, suggesting specific
interspecies differences depending on low shear and high shear values of WBV, as a result of mechanisms that
influence RBC flexibility. PV was highest in cattle and lowest in rabbit and mouse and did not correlate with
WBV. Haemorheological parameters differed between the species. Each species has its own rheological
fingerprint. The physiological significance of these variations among mammalian species has not yet been
established. Viscosity contributes to endothelial cell shear stress. While haemorheological parameters differ
across the species it may be postulated that factors influencing flow-mediated endothelial cell signal
transduction are different among the species.  Experimental Physiology (2003) 88.3, 431–440.

evaluated in recent studies. Comparison of viscometric
measurements is further complicated by differences in
methodology among the individual studies as well as species-
related factors.
In the following study we describe the rheological
properties of blood from mammalian species that are of
interest in veterinary medicine and are commonly used in
experimental research. A total of 360 animals were used in
this study. Blood from 40 animals of nine species was
analysed employing the same protocol for all animals. It
was thus possible to standardize the shear history for each
sample and, at the same time, keep procedures at a
minimum. Measurements were carried out by experienced
investigators. Incomplete data sets were eliminated from
the study. In addition to our reference values for standard
haemorheological parameters, a complex comparison of
whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte
aggregation and related parameters is presented.
METHODS 
Withdrawal of blood
Blood was withdrawn by venipuncture from healthy adult horses
(Warmblut; 28 gelding, 12 mare; age, 7–13 years), pigs (28
Edelschwein w Pietrain, 12 Landschwein w Edelschwein; 8 male
(castrated), 32 female; age, 5–12 months), dogs (24 beagle, 4
German shepherd dogs, 3 golden retriever, 1 boxer, 1 labrador
retriever, 1 greyhound, 1 Hovawart, 1 Jack-Russell terrier, 2
collies, 2 Doberman pinschers; 17 male (6 castrated), 23 female
(10 ovariectomized); age, 2–10 years), cats (37 European shorthair,
2 Siamese, 1 Karthäuser; 15 male (14 castrated), 25 female
(18 ovariectomized); age, 1–11 years), cattle (34 Fleckvieh,
6 Braunvieh; 40 female; age, 2–4 years), sheep (27 Bergschaf, 13
Milchschaf; 40 female; age, 2–5 years) and rabbits (37 New
Zealand White, 3 chinchilla bastard; 12 male, 28 female; age,
5–13 months). Rats (Wistar, 9 male, 31 female; age, 4–6 months)
and mice (BALB/c, 7 male, 33 female; age, 4–8 months) were
anaesthetized with 100 mg kg_1 ketamine and 1 mg kg_1 xylazine
intraperitoneally before blood was taken by puncture of the right
ventricle. No muscle relaxant drug was used. Rats and mice were
killed after blood withdrawal by an I.V. bolus of 100 mg kg_1
thiopentone. Blood from horses, pigs, dogs, cats, cattle, sheep
and rabbits flowed passively into two standard tubes containing
K-EDTA. Carefully avoiding heavy suction, blood from rats and
mice was withdrawn using 5 ml and 1 ml syringes, respectively.
Blood samples from pigs, dogs, cats, sheep, rabbits, rats and mice
were immediately placed in a centrifuge at room temperature
and analysed haematologically after 1 h. However, all haemo-
rheological and haematological measurements were completed
within 4 h of blood sampling.
All animal experiments were carried out according to national
guidelines (national approval number: GZ-Nr: 66.009/16-
Pr/4/2000).
Haematological measurements
A Cell-Dyn 3500 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA)
was used for the following haematological measurements:
red blood cell (RBC) count (cells w 106 ml_1), haemoglobin
concentration (g dl_1), mean corpuscular volume (MCV, fl),
mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH, pg), mean corpuscular
haemoglobin concentration (MCHC, g dl_1), white blood cell
(WBC) count (cells w 103 ml_1) and platelet count (cells w 105
ml_1). Haematocrit (Hct, %) was measured by centrifugation
(Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany).
Haemorheological measurements
Haemorheology was carried out using an LS30 viscometer
(Contraves AG, Zürich, Switzerland) at three different shear rates
(0.7, 2.4 and 94 s_1) at 37°C, to obtain whole blood viscosity
(WBV, mPa s) and using a Myrenne aggregometer MA1 (Myrenne
GmbH, Roetgen, Germany) to measure erythrocyte aggregation
at room temperature (aggregation index: M0, M1). Aggregation
was not checked microscopically.
Principles of measurement of aggregation: 
(1) Contraves LS30. A 1 ml sample of blood is placed into the
modified Couette co-axial cylinder system of the device. When
the outside cylinder is rotated the viscosity of blood, which exerts
mechanical strain on the freely movable inner cylinder, is
measured electromagnetically. Shear rates of 0.7, 2.4 and 94 s_1
were used in this study. Three consecutive readings were taken
for each value.
(2) Myrenne aggregometer MA1. A 30 ml sample of blood is
placed between the transparent cone-plate shearing device and is
spread to a cellular layer. This layer is sheared at 600 s_1 for 10 s
to disaggregate all pre-existing aggregates, then abruptly stopped
in M0 mode or rotated at 3 s_1 in M1 mode for another 10 s to
allow aggregation. The extent of plasma gaps inside the whole
blood monolayer allows more light to pass through the red cell
suspension. The instrument computes an aggregation index (M0
at stasis and M1 at 3 s_1) proportional to the area under the light
transmission curve, which reflects the degree of aggregation
attained by the end of the 10 s period (Nash et al. 1987). At least
five readings were taken for each value of M0 and M1.
An additional aggregation index (AI) was obtained using the
LS30 viscometer during the measurement of whole blood
viscosity at low shear rates (0.7 and 2.4 s_1) by the following
procedure: after measurement of the WBV at 0.7 and 2.4 s_1, the
cup was further rotated at the same speed for 45 s. After 45 s the
WBV was read again. AI was determined by the formula:
AI = (peak WBV _ WBV after 45 s)/peak WBV.
Calculation of AI by this formula is based upon the hypothesis
that the peak value of WBV represents the characteristic viscosity
of the blood sample at the given shear rate, whereas the
secondary decline is thought to be affected by axial migration of
red cell aggregates from the wall of the viscometer which is a
measure of erythrocyte aggregation (Johnson et al. 1999).
Plasma viscosity (PV) was measured using OCR-D (oscillating
capillary rheometer and densitometer; Paar, Graz, Austria) at
21°C. In mouse, blood was pooled from 5–10 animals after the
end of the rheological measurement and plasma viscosity was
carried out from this pooled plasma.
Principles of measurement of plasma viscosity:
OCR-D. A plastic cup containing 1 ml plasma is mounted at the
bottom of a glass capillary (diameter, 0.9864 mm; length,
100 mm). The plastic cup is compressed at 2 Hz exerting shear
rates inside the capillary. The viscosity at the shear rate of 10 s_1
was determined.
Whole blood was tested first at its native haematocrit. To
compare the values among the species, another portion of blood
from all species except mouse was adjusted to a haematocrit of
40 % and analysed. Haematocrit standardisation was carried
out by centrifugation (Rotanta RPC, Hettich, Tuttlingen,
Deutschland: 2000 U min_1, corresponding to RZB (relative

centrifugal acceleration) = 595, for 10 min), plasma separation
and resuspension of the blood cell concentration in autologous
plasma to the desired haematocrit. Blood from mouse was tested
only at its native haematocrit.
Additional measurements
Fibrinogen concentration was measured according to the
method of Clauss. To evaluate the health status of the animals,
routine blood chemical measurements (Hitachi 904, Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan) were assessed for each sample except for mouse. In
mouse, following the withdrawal of blood for haemorheological
measurements, a small amount of blood was pooled from 5–10
animals to obtain fibrinogen concentration and blood chemistry
values.
Protocol of measurements
After withdrawal of whole blood, the haematological measurements
were made and one blood sample in a K-EDTA-containing tube
was centrifuged for haematocrit adjustment. Meanwhile, whole
blood viscosity at the native haematocrit and erythrocyte
aggregation were measured. Then the same haemorheological
parameters were evaluated using standardized blood. Blood from
individual animals was pooled and centrifuged, and plasma
viscosity was measured on the next day (plasma sample stored at
4°C). By using this protocol, a maximum of 10 samples could be
measured within 4 h of withdrawal of blood.
Statistics
Descriptive analysis of native and haematocrit-standardized data
was performed according to the method of Harrell & Davis
(1995). Data are presented as median and 25th and 75th
percentile. Values within this percentile range were used as
‘reference values’. Differences between the animal species were
evaluated from data obtained from the standardized blood
samples only and were calculated first using the Kruskal-Wallis
test. In a second step, pairwise comparisons of all species were
performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The resulting P
values were corrected by the Bonferroni-Holm procedure (Holm,
1979). Correlations between haemorheological data and total
protein concentration, fibrinogen concentration, MCV and
MCHC were assessed by the Spearman correlation coefficient, r.
P values were corrected using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The
software SAS System V 8.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA)
was used for statistical analysis.
We are well aware that the term ‘reference value’ is difficult to
apply to the haemorheological values determined in this study
due to the inherent variations in methodology among different
laboratories. The established numerical values are therefore used
as ‘laboratory-specific’ reference values. However, the consistency
of the applied procedures in combination with the experience of
the investigators justifies the interspecies comparison of the
gathered data.
RESULTS
Haematological measurements
All values were within physiological limits. MCV was
greatest in rabbit followed by pig, cattle, rat, mouse, horse
and sheep. MCH was greatest in rabbit followed by dog,
pig, cattle, rat, horse, mouse, cat and sheep. MCHC was
greatest in horse followed by dog, rat, sheep, cat, mouse,
cattle, pig and rabbit. Table 1 shows the haematological

data from the tested animal species, with reference values
from healthy animals. 
Haemorheological measurements
‘Reference’ values are presented in Table 2 (viscometric data
of standardized blood samples) and Table 3 (erythrocyte
aggregation data of standardized blood samples). Due to
the number of animals (40 per species) the 25th and 75th
percentile distance was taken as the reference range.
At a standardized haematocrit value, whole blood viscosity
at the three different shear rates, the aggregation indices
and plasma viscosity were different among the animal
species, as identified by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Within the
data some parameters from the various animal species
were not significantly different following Bonferroni-
Holm correction. All data are presented as median with the
25th and 75th percentiles in parentheses.
Figures 1 to 5 show the values of PV, WBV at 0.7 s_1, WBV
at 94 s_1, AI at 2.4 s_1 and M0 of the standardized samples,
respectively.
Differences in plasma viscosity
The values of PV were in the range 1.30 (1.24/1.41) to 1.72
(1.63/1.94) in all the species tested. The highest value was
measured in blood from cattle, followed by cat, horse, dog,
rat, pig, sheep, mouse and rabbit. There were two groups
of animals. In the first group, the plasma viscosity was
higher (cattle, cat, horse, dog, rat and pig) than in the other
group (sheep, mouse and rabbit) (see Fig. 1).
Differences in whole blood viscosity at low shear rate
Shear rate 0.7 s_1. The values of WBV were in the range
6.556 (6.015/7.349) to 38.173 (31.657/42.547) in all the
species tested. The highest value was measured in blood
taken from horse followed by rat, cat, pig, dog, mouse,
rabbit, sheep and cattle (see Fig. 2).
Shear rate 2.4 s_1. The values of WBV were in the range
6.092 (5.731/6.793) to 20.179 (17.227/24.384) in all the
species tested, and the species distribution followed the
same pattern as above.
Differences in whole blood viscosity at high shear rate
(94 s_1)
The values of WBV were in the range 4.043 (3.750/4.375)
to 6.288 (5.883/6.920) in all the species tested. The highest
value was measured in blood from rat followed by dog,
horse, pig, mouse, cattle, cat, sheep and rabbit (see Fig. 3).
Differences in erythrocyte aggregation
Aggregation index (AI) measured using the LS30 viscometer:
AI at shear rate 0.7 s_1. The values of AI were in the range
0.0 (0.0/0.0) to 0.30 (0.27/0.36) in all the species tested.

Relationships between the parameters within the animal
species
In all species, except dog, a positive correlation was found
between the plasma total protein concentration and
parameters related to erythrocyte aggregation, such as WBV
at low shear rate and aggregation indices, both native and
standardized. In mouse, a trend was observed suggesting a
relationship between total protein concentration and WBV
at low shear rate in native blood. In dog and pig, a positive
correlation was found between the plasma fibrinogen
concentration and the plasma viscosity. Positive correlation
of fibrinogen concentration with parameters which
indicate RBC aggregation were found in horse, cattle and
pig. These results are summarized in Table 4.

Haemorheological values correlated with erythrocyte
indices in only a few of the animal species. In dog, MCHC
correlated significantly with the aggregation index AI
(r = 0.476, P < 0.01) and in rabbit, MCHC correlated with
the aggregation index M0 (r = 0.467, P < 0.05). No
correlation was found between the MCV and haemo-
rheological parameters.
Additional measurements
Plasma total protein and fibrinogen concentration, as well
as haematocrit were different among the animals tested
(see Table 1). Cattle demonstrated the highest total
protein. Cattle also demonstrated the highest fibrinogen
concentration, followed by rabbit, mouse, sheep, rat, cat,
dog, pig and horse. Species with low erythrocyte aggregation
had higher plasma fibrinogen concentrations. Dog showed
the highest haematocrit followed by rat, mouse, cat, rabbit,
horse, pig, sheep and cattle.
Blood chemistry data were within normal ranges (Kraft &
Dürr, 1997) in all the animals. Values of the plasma
fibrinogen and total protein concentration of animals are
included in Table 1.
DISCUSSION 
The values of whole blood viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation
and plasma viscosity differed among the mammalian species
investigated. Resembling a fingerprint, each species had its
own individual haemorheological characteristics. In the
following discussion, these individual characteristics as
well as the respective variations among the species will be
considered.
Differences in WBV at low shear
Based on the WBV under low shear, the animals could be
divided into two groups: one group with an elevated WBV
including horse, rat, pig, dog and cat, and a second group
with a low WBV including cattle, sheep, rabbit and mouse.
It is generally accepted that pronounced red cell aggregation
is a major factor contributing to increased whole blood
viscosity at low shear. In eight out of nine species this
assumption could be verified. However, in rats our finding
of high WBV values in combination with a low erythrocyte
aggregation contrasted with this general assumption
despite the fact that erythrocyte aggregation was measured
by two different methods. A slightly elevated WBV despite
a decreased erythrocyte aggregation in rats was also
observed by Baskurt et al. (1997). It seems that the extent
of erythrocyte aggregation does not influence the high
WBV at low shear in the rat. Another possible parameter
affecting WBV is the haematocrit. In this study the possible
influence of the haematocrit on WBV was eliminated by
standardizing the blood samples. When these standardized
blood samples were compared there was still no difference
between the WBV of rat and horse, the latter having
pronounced WBV and high erythrocyte aggregation.
Plasma viscosity, total protein concentration and fibrinogen
concentration further influence WBV. However, these
parameters were not increased in the rat. In order to
exclude possible bias, a second series of 40 rats was tested
by different investigators. The results of this second series
supported the findings of our first series. Increasing the
shear rate led to a decline in WBV, but WBV at 94 s_1 was
still higher in the rat than in the other animals. It seems
that mechanisms other than erythrocyte aggregation,
haemoconcentration or suspending phase viscosity are
responsible for the high WBV in the rat. These mechanisms
might include mechanical or geometrical properties of the
red blood cell (Meiselman, 1978).
Differences in erythrocyte aggregation
Erythrocyte aggregation was increased in horse, pig, dog
and cat, whereas erythrocyte aggregation in rat, cattle, sheep,
rabbit and mouse was low or undetectable. Interestingly,
animals with low erythrocyte aggregation tended to have a
higher plasma fibrinogen concentration than animals
with high red cell aggregation. As expected, erythrocyte
aggregation within a species correlated with the plasma
concentration of total protein. This correlation was not
found in the dogs investigated in this study, probably due
to the differences in breed, age and sex amongst the
animals in this group. These factors have been correlated
with notable differences in haemorheological variables
among individuals of the same species in the past  (Bodey
& Rampling, 1998).
In horse, cattle and pig, a positive correlation was found
between the plasma fibrinogen concentration and
parameters that indicate erythrocyte aggregation. In the
other species, erythrocyte aggregation and fibrinogen did
not correlate. Nevertheless, the lack of methodologically
dependent numerical correlation does not indicate an
absence of a relationship between these parameters. The
measure of fibrinogen concentration depends on various
factors such as methods of blood sampling or blood
storage. Furthermore, the observed aggregation index was
sometimes small to start with and a potential relation
between these parameters was therefore difficult to
establish.
The origin of red blood cell aggregation is complex and can
be explained by two theories: the bridging theory (Chien &
Sung, 1987; Brooks, 1988) and the more recently proposed
depletion theory (Bäumler et al. 1999; Armstrong et al.
1999). Aggregation takes place at low or zero shear
conditions. Plasma factors such as the concentration of the
macromolecules fibrinogen or dextran and cellular factors
including the affinity of the red cell for macromolecules,
geometric factors, red cell surface charge and the
membrane and cytoskeletal composition all influence red
blood cell aggregation.
The physiological function of erythrocyte aggregation and
its haemorheological effects on blood flow are still
controversial. For example, in a feline gastrocnemius muscle
model (Cabel et al. 1997), an increase in erythrocyte
aggregation was associated with an increase in venous flow
resistance. These findings were supported by a study which
showed that red blood cell aggregation led to increased
venous flow resistance as arterial pressure and flow rate

were reduced (Bishop et al. 2001). In contrast, when human
blood was used in a guinea pig model, an increase in red
cell aggregation was related to a decrease in venous flow
resistance (Baskurt et al. 1999).
Studies with hyperaggregating blood indicate that axial
migration is larger and directly related to the aggregation
tendency of the blood (Reinke et al. 1986; Cokelet &
Goldsmith, 1991; Qin et al. 1998). Erythrocyte aggregation
in turn augments the axial migration of red blood cells
during blood flow. As an advantage, the hydrodynamic
resistance is thus reduced, while at the same time the
margination of leucocytes and platelets is facilitated (Stoltz
et al. 1999).
Under pathological conditions, such as sepsis or diabetes,
red blood cell aggregation is often increased as well. In
contrast to the effect of EA during physiological conditions,
oxygen distribution and peripheral perfusion are impaired
under these circumstances.
Red blood cell aggregation is different between animal
species. However, its physiological and evolutionary impact
has so far not been elucidated. Besides all mentioned
effects, the vasculature of the various animals should have
adapted to the degree of red cell aggregation. Even in horses,
the species with ‘hyperaggregating’ blood, no impairment
of oxygen distribution is observed when physical
performance is associated with increased haematocrit and
viscosity, at least in trained animals (B. Stoiber, personal
communication). Further factors leading to species-
dependent differences in red blood cell aggregation must
be taken into account. The viscosity of the cellular contents
of the erythrocyte may vary; for example, dense erythrocytes
are more rigid (Linderkamp et al. 1993). Estimation of
internal viscosity based on the MCHC (Pfafferott et al.
1982) differed among the animals. However, an interspecies
relationship to red blood cell aggregation could not be
ruled out. Red blood cell shape might also play a role, since
the MCV is different in all animals, but no relationship was
detected. However, species differences might exist in the
molecular weights of fibrinogen and other macromolecules
which are important for red blood cell aggregation
(Andrews et al. 1992), but this was not tested in the present
study.
Further, there is evidence that sedentary animals have
lower blood viscosity than athletic animals (Popel et al.
1994). Horses are athletic animals that can perform
extensive muscle work in the presence of increased red cell
aggregation. Hyperaggregating blood leads to increased
plasma skimming. Based on this, one might speculate that
capillary perfusion is augmented under these circumstances.
Here, increased plasma skimming allows the activity-
dependent adaptation of the capillary haematocrit and, at
the same time, eases the flow of blood with a high
haematocrit through arteriovenous anastomoses. This
would enable the intensively retracted erythrocyte column
to act as an O2-carrier reservoir.
Finally, vessel length plays a role in axial migration. Because
erythrocyte aggregation is a time-consuming process, a
minimum tube length is required for sufficient plasma
skimming. In the venous network, constant infusions of
blood from the daughter vessels impair axial migration
(Bishop et al. 2001). For the interpretation of erythrocyte
aggregation in different animals, the geometric variability
of the vascular network has to be considered. However,
comparative studies of the vasculature of small or large
animals and of animals with high or with low erythrocyte
aggregation, are lacking. Speculatively, we assume that the
necessary dimensions for erythrocyte aggregation might
not exist in small animals such as the mouse, rat and
rabbit.
Differences in WBV at high shear stress
During high shear stress, differences in WBV among the
species decrease. Interestingly, animals with elevated whole
blood viscosity at low shear rate do not necessarily have an
increased viscosity at high shear rate. For instance, whole
blood viscosity at 94 s_1 was higher in cattle than in cat.
Also rat and dog had a higher whole blood viscosity than
horse at this shear rate. During high shear stress, the red
cell aggregates are destroyed. Erythrocytes become
oriented in the direction of flow while their cytoskeleton
reorganizes. The main cellular factor influencing whole
blood viscosity is erythrocyte deformability. Erythrocyte
deformability is affected by the mean shear rate, tube
diameter, external fluid viscosity, cell shape and geometry,
membrane and cytoskeletal viscoelasticity, internal fluid
viscosity and physicochemical properties of haemoglobin.
Although erythrocyte deformability was not measured in
this study, there may be some differences among the
species. These differences might not be uniform in animals
which have erythrocyte aggregation or in those animals
where it is undetectable.
Differences in plasma viscosity
Plasma viscosity plays an important role in the perfusion of
the microvasculature. Since the haematocrit is dramatically
reduced according to the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect,
viscosity in the arterioles and capillaries is reduced almost
to the value of viscosity in the plasma. Therefore plasma
viscosity, in addition to intraluminal pressure and flow
pattern, is a major determinant of endothelial shear stress
in this particular region. Plasma viscosity is used as a
marker for different diseases in humans such as coronary
artery disease (Koenig et al. 2000; Lowe et al. 2000), lupus
erythematosus (Reid & DeCeulaer, 1999; Rosenson et al.
2001) and rheumatoid arthritis (Grassi et al. 1998). However,
an increase in plasma viscosity with the progression of
disease (Hoffmeister et al. 2001) or with therapy (Gibbs et
al. 2001) was not observed.
Plasma viscosity was highest in cattle, presumably because
of the increased plasma protein content in this species and
was lowest in rabbit and mouse. Despite these differences
in plasma viscosity, these animals have uniform WBV at
low shear because of minimal red cell aggregation.

Experimental Physiology : Translation and Integration
Therefore, animals with a low WBV do not necessarily
have low plasma viscosity.
The findings of this study do not show a uniform
relationship between WBV, plasma viscosity and erythrocyte
aggregation. Plasma viscosity is increased by raised levels of
macromolecules such as fibrinogen. Fibrinogen also
increases erythrocyte aggregation. Cattle, rabbit, sheep and
mouse tend to have higher fibrinogen levels than horse,
pig, dog, cat and rat. This is interesting, since rabbit and
mouse, both have a low aggregation tendency and a low
plasma viscosity while at the same time their fibrinogen
level is high. Cattle have a very low red blood cell
aggregation in the presence of high fibrinogen levels.
However, in contrast to rabbit and mouse, cattle have a
high plasma viscosity. The reason for this discrepancy is
unclear. Generally, species with low plasma viscosity such
as rabbit and mouse might elicit lower endothelial shear
stress than animals with high plasma viscosity such as
cattle. The clinical significance of an increased plasma
viscosity is unclear, since the results of a recent study
showed that plasma viscosity was rather the result of
coronary artery disease than its cause (Pfafferott et al.
1999).
Conclusion
Haemorheological parameters differed between the species
studied. Each species has its own rheological fingerprint.
The physiological significance of these variations in
different mammalian species is not entirely clear at
present.
Viscosity is a contributor to endothelial cell shear stress.
The findings of this study show that viscosity, as well as
other haemorheological parameters, differs across the species
tested. We therefore postulate that factors influencing
flow-mediated endothelial cell signal transduction are also
different among the species.
