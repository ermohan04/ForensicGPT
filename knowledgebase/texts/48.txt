Abstract
The forensic application of the luminol chemiluminescence reaction is reviewed. Luminol has been effectively employed for more than 40 years
for the presumptive detection of bloodstains which are hidden from the naked eye at crime scenes and, for this reason, has been considered one
of the most important and well-known assays in the ﬁeld of forensic sciences. This review provides an historical overview of the forensic use of
luminol, and the current understanding of the reaction mechanism with particular reference to the catalysis by blood. Operational use of the luminol
reaction, including issues with interferences and the effect of the luminol reaction on subsequent serological and DNA testing is also discussed.

1. Introduction
The emission of light observed when a solution containing
luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazine-dione or, more
simply, 3-aminophthalhydrazide) and hydrogen peroxide is
sprayed on dried bloodstains has been utilised by forensic sci-
entists in investigations involving violent crime for more than
40 years. This article reviews the current understanding of the
chemistry and mechanism of the luminol reaction as it pertains to
the detection of bloodstains. A forensic overview of operational
use of the luminol reaction will be given including a discus-
sion of interfering species and the possible detrimental effect of
luminol on further presumptive tests for blood and DNA typing
analyses.
1.1. Chemiluminescence
Chemiluminescence [1] refers to the emission of light from
a chemical reaction, which can occur in solid, liquid or gas
systems. The fundamentals of chemiluminescence have been
comprehensively reviewed in a number of textbooks and articles
in recent years [2–5].
Two main categories of chemiluminescent reaction have been
described in the literature, direct and indirect. Direct chemilu-
minescence can be represented by:
A + B →[I]∗→PRODUCTS + LIGHT
where A and B are reactants and [I]* is an excited state inter-
mediate. The luminol reaction is an example of this form of
chemiluminescence. In certain cases where the excited state is
an inefﬁcient emitter, its energy may be passed on to another
species (a sensitizer, F) for light emission to be observed. This
is called “indirect chemiluminescence” and is exempliﬁed by
the peroxyoxalate (light stick) reaction:
A + B →[I]∗+ F →[F]∗→F + LIGHT
Once a molecule has been converted to a metastable interme-
diate in an excited state there are a number of routes by which
it can return to the ground state. These routes can be displayed
diagrammatically, as in Fig. 1, by an “energy well” diagram, or
more simply by the Jablonski diagram, ﬁrst introduced in the
1930s. The light emission can either be ﬂuorescence or chemi-
luminescence, if from a singlet state, or phosphorescence if from
a triplet state.
The light emitted from chemiluminescent reactions has dif-
fering degrees of intensity, lifetime and wavelength with the
latter parameter covering the spectrum from near ultraviolet,
through the visible and into the near infrared.
For emission to be observed from a chemical reaction, three
essential energetic requirements need to be met:
1. There should be an energetically favourable reaction path-
way for the production of the excited state species. Of the
total number of molecules participating in the reaction a
signiﬁcant number should reach the excited state.
2. Thereactionisrequiredtobeexothermic,withthefreeenergy
change being in the range 170–300 kJ mol−1.
3. Thereshouldbeafavourabledeactivationpathwayforchemi-
luminescence emission, with other competitive non-radiative
processes such as intra- or intermolecular energy transfer,
molecular dissociation, isomerization or physical quenching
kept to a minimum.
The intensity of the chemiluminescence emission from a
reaction is dependant upon the rate of reaction and the efﬁciency
of the process generating excited state species. The latter can
be described by the chemiluminescence quantum yield, ΦCL,
which is deﬁned as:
ΦCL = total number of photons emitted
number of molecules reacting

ΦCL is the product of three factors: the fraction of excited states
produced, ΦEX; the fraction of reacting molecules following
the correct chemical path, ΦR; and the ﬂuorescence quantum
yield of the emitter, ΦF:
ΦCL = ΦEXΦRΦF
Chemiluminescence quantum yields vary widely from 10−15 to
nearly 1, however most of the reactions used in analysis fall in the
range 0.01–0.1 [6]. The use of very sensitive detectors and the
almost complete absence of background emission has allowed
the monitoring of even inefﬁcient chemiluminescence reactions
with quantum efﬁciencies less than 0.001, such as the oxidative
ultra-weak chemiluminescent reactions in living cells [7].
The quantum efﬁciency and colour of a chemiluminescence
emission are greatly affected by the environment in which the
reaction takes place. For solution phase chemiluminescence the
factors that will affect the reaction are similar to those affect-
ing normal ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence. For example,
the chemiluminescence quantum yield and colour of emission
for luminol in dimethylsulfoxide and water are 0.05, blue-
green (λmax ∼480–502 nm) and 0.01, blue-violet to blue-green
(λmax ∼425 nm), respectively [8,9].
For most analytical purposes it is the chemiluminescence
emission intensity (ICL) that is measured, either as an integral
over the lifetime of the emission or as a transient response. It is
a function of both the efﬁciency and the rate of the reaction:
ICL = ΦCL
dC
dt

where dC/dt is the rate of reaction (molecules reacting s−1).
Chemiluminescence reactions can occur very rapidly (<1 s) or
extremely slowly (>1 day), according to the reaction and the
conditions.
1.2. Luminol historical background
Some of the key events in the discovery, study, and use of
luminol are shown in Fig. 2. Even though there is some debate
as to the ﬁrst report of the synthesis of luminol [10,11], the Ger-
man scientist Schmitz has often been suggested as the ﬁrst to
have produced this compound in 1908 [12,13]. Regardless of
this controversy, it is now widely accepted that Albrecht was the
ﬁrst to report its involvement in chemiluminescence reactions
in 1928 [14] (Fig. 2). Specht, a forensic scientist at the Univer-
sity Institute for Legal Medicine and Scientiﬁc Criminalistics
of Jena, Germany, ﬁrst studied in depth the role of hemin, an
iron-containing compound derived from heme, in the chemical
reaction involving luminol and investigated its potential appli-
cation in blood detection [15]. This represented the ﬁrst use of
liquid phase chemiluminescence for analytical purposes.
Proesher and Moody [16], investigating both the chemical
structure and reaction properties of luminol, correctly pre-
dicted the keto-enolic tautomerisation of luminol in alkaline
solutions and the fully protonated form in acidic solutions.
They concluded that chemiluminescence emission intensity
and duration were increased with dried and decomposed blood,
aged even for 3 years, with respect to fresh blood. They also
observed that luminol solution could be sprayed many times
over bloodstains, particularly if dried, allowing a repetition of
the chemiluminescence.
McGrath [17] evaluated the speciﬁcity of the luminol test on
biological ﬂuids and showed that luminol displayed a speciﬁcity
for blood while appearing insensitive to the other biological ﬂu-
ids studied. Nevertheless, when used as presumptive test for
blood identiﬁcation, he recommended the conﬁrmation of the
luminol reaction with other more speciﬁc serological tests.
Grodsky et al. [18] proposed a blend of powders made up
of luminol, sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and sodium perborate
(NaBO3·nH2O) mixed with distilled water. This subsequently
became the formula that is most commonly used by today’s
investigators to detect traces of blood at the scene of a crime. An
alternative formulation was proposed by Weber [19] of luminol,
sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and hydrogen per-
oxide diluted in distilled water. The solution so obtained needed
to be kept in a cool place away from direct light and showed a
brief lifespan.
Since these early studies in luminol, there have been sev-
eral other attempts to elucidate the reaction mechanism, with
a major effort by Mer´enyi and co-workers in the 1980s culmi-
nating in a summary paper in 1990 [20]. Thornton and Maloney

Over the last 20 years luminol has become one of the widest
used chemiluminescent reagents for application to molecular
biology and analytical chemistry. It has been used as the basis
for a multitude of sensitive and selective detection methods
including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
immunoassay, DNA probes, DNA typing and as substrate in
western blot detection [5,21–29]. More recently, also historical
and archaeological studies using luminol have been successfully
carriedout[30,31]disclosinganinterestingnewapplicationﬁeld

2. The luminol reaction
2.1. Luminol chemical and physical properties and
chemiluminescence
Luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazine-dione) is a
cyclic acyl-hydrazide, and shows the typical reactivity of
this class of compounds [32]. Beyond the common chem-
ical, physical and toxicological characteristics which are
succinctly described in Table 1 [9,33] and are also available
at The National Toxicology Program (The National Insti-
tute of Environmental Health Sciences, NC, USA) website
(http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/index.cfm)1, luminol presents some

and Human Services. The National Toxicology Program is headquartered on the

properties which are especially relevant when it is used for
forensic purposes: photo- and thermal-stability and chemical
behaviour in protic polar media.
Luminol solutions are sensitive to light and the presence of
metal cations; typically they are only stable 8–12 h. Luminol
was shown to be thermally unstable, so luminol and its solutions
should be protected from high temperature [34].
Two separate pKa values (6.74 and 15.1), corresponding to
loss of the two acyl-hydrazide protons, at (pKa1) and (pKa2)
have been found [35–37]. Thus in aqueous solution phase lumi-
nol (LH2) can be found in the fully protonated form in acidic
solutions while, when dissolved in a basic solution, above about
pH 7, dissociations to the monoanion (LH−) and dianion (L2−)
occur. The fully-protonated and monodeprotonated (monoan-
ionic) forms of luminol can undergo keto-enolic tautomerisation
in solution and the solid state [16,32,37] (Fig. 3), although most
authors (including us) represent these compounds with the pro-
tons on the nitrogens.
Luminol chemiluminescence has recently been reviewed by
Barnett and Francis [5]. The light-producing pathway for the
oxidation of luminol is a complex multi-step process and is
dependent on several factors including pH, temperature and
ionic strength of the reaction medium and reactive species that
can be present in solution and interact with luminol, metal cat-
alyst or hydroxide ions [5].
White et al. observed that the ﬂuorescence spectrum of an
intermediate molecule in the luminol oxidation process named
3-aminophthalate in an electronically excited state (3-APA*)
perfectly matched the chemiluminescence spectrum of luminol,
thus they concluded that this excited intermediate could be con-
sideredthelightemittingspeciesupondeexcitationtotheground
state (3-APA) [38–40]. This was conﬁrmed in 1965 by Gunder-

mann [41]. In dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) containing O2, or in moderate-strong alkaline protic
solvents (pH ∼8–11) such as water or lower alcohols and in
presence of a strong-mild oxidant (in most cases H2O2) and a
suitable catalyst such as a metal ion or some kind of oxidore-
ductase enzyme, the excited 3-aminophthalate dianion (3-APA*)
returns to the ground state (3-APA) by releasing energy in the
form of light (Fig. 4). When the reaction occurs in protic media,
the 3-aminophthalate dianion is produced in almost quantitative
fashion [40,42–46].
In aqueous solutions the light observed ranges between blue-
violet and blue-green (Fig. 5), although the spectral range of
emission is often rather broad and the observed maximum is
dependent on several parameters of the reaction [39,44] such as
the presence of blood itself which strongly absorbs at 420 nm
and may provide an inner-ﬁlter effect, thus shifting the observed
maximum emission of luminol chemiluminescence to about
455 nm [47].
For the luminol reaction the exact role of the catalyst, which
is required when the reaction is carried out in basic aqueous
solution, and the reaction intermediates are not completely char-
acterised. It is known that a wide range of other transition
metal catalysts and metal-complexes catalyse the reaction and
that the optimum conditions of pH for the reaction depends
on the identity of the catalyst used and varies between pH 8
and 11 [48] thus suggesting a multiplicity of potential catalysis
mechanisms.
2.2. Hemoglobin and its derivatives: biology and catalytic
role in luminol test
Hemoglobin (Hb) is the oxygen-carrying molecule found in
the erythrocytes of all vertebrates and some invertebrates and is

responsible for the red colour of blood. Mammalian hemoglobin
is a tetrameric hemoprotein composed of four protein portions,
named globins each enclosing a prosthetic heme group, consist-
ing of a protoporphyrin IX–Fe2+ coordination complex (Fig. 6,
Panel A) [49]. The ferrous ion is bound in the middle of the
protoporphyrin IX ring by the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms. Of
the remaining two axial coordination sites, above and below the
planar ring of the porphyrin, one is occupied by a histidine on
the globin (ﬁfth coordination position) while the second axial
position (sixth coordination position) is available for an exoge-
nous ligand which, in the case of oxyhemoglobin is O2 (while
no ligand is present in this position in deoxyhemoglobin).
Within the body human hemoglobin is protected against
denaturation by encapsulation in red blood cells and iron ions
are kept in the ferrous state by several mechanisms, both
non-enzymatic (globin envelope prevents Fe2+ oxidation and
erythrocytes reduced glutathione reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+) and
enzymatic (mainly NADPH-MetHb reductase and NADH cyt b5
reductase of the erythrocytes catalyze Fe3+ reduction to Fe2+)
so that methemoglobin (MetHb) formation is hampered [50].
Hence, the valence of iron is kept the same upon bonding with
oxygen (oxygenation) or losing oxygen (deoxygenation).
Once outside the organism and deposited on a substrate,
blood is subjected to a series of degradation processes [10]
in which most erythrocytes undergo hemolysis and biological
molecules are involved in hydrolytic and/or oxidoreductive reac-
tions primarily catalyzed from their own intracellular enzymes
(e.g. aseptic autolysis due to catepsins released from dead cells
lysosomes), or from enzymes of microorganisms populating the
external environment. Degradation of the polypeptidic portion
of hemoglobin takes place, the histidine coordinating the iron ion
is generally lost, and spontaneous oxidation of the Fe2+ ion con-
tained in the tetrapyrrolic ring of heme prosthetic group to Fe3+
ion rapidly occurs since, in this condition, cellular iron reduction
processes lack [16,51–53]. If alkaline conditions are present, the
Fe3+ is coordinatinated by a hydroxyl group ( OH−). The heme
prosthetic group containing ferric rather than ferrous iron, with
the O2 being replaced by the hydroxyl group, is named hematin
(ferric protoporphyrin hydroxide) (Fig. 6, Panel B) and, corre-
spondingly, the bloodstain shows a chromatic change from a
typically red colour to a tawny-brown [49,53]. The processes of
loss of the polypeptidic shells of hemoglobin and conversion of
heme prosthetic group into hematin are increased when a lumi-
nol preparation is sprayed onto the bloodstain due to both the
presence of an oxidant and the alkaline environment.
When a luminol formulation is applied on a bloodstain, fer-
ric heme groups are able to catalyze both the decomposition
reaction of peroxide and the oxidation of luminol and other
substrates by peroxide [54–57]. These reactions are thought
to be allowed by the ability of the hydroxy-ferric-porphyrin
(OH-Fe3+-P) hematin group to undergo a two-electron oxidation
to a hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin radical (OH-Fe4+-P•) (analogous
to Compound I in enzymes peroxidases, although the radi-
cal centre can then translocate to the globin), which can then
return to the ferric porphyrin hematin state in two one-electron
reduction steps via the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin (OH-Fe4+-P)
hematin group (analogous to Compound II in enzymes peroxi-
dases) (Fig. 7) [13,19,57–59]. The catalytic process thus cycles
between these three oxidation states of the hemoglobin, with the
stable resting state being the ferric hematin. Alternative catalytic
cycles and oxidising species have been proposed (e.g. see Thorn-
ton and Maloney [13]), but the above cycle is now accepted by
the majority of researchers [57,60].
As these ferric heme derivatives show the same catalytic
properties and capability of participating in two-electron redox
cycles as a group of enzymes called peroxidases widely dis-
tributed especially in vegetables, their activity is termed a
pseudo-peroxidase or peroxidase-like. This activity is com-

monly employed as the basis for many presumptive tests for
blood including luminol [10,40,61–63].
Thornton and Maloney [13] proposed three other possibilities
for the peroxidase-like activity of blood apart from the partic-
ipation of the heme in hemoglobin. Of these, xanthine oxidase
and true peroxidase were thought to be unlikely by Thornton
and Maloney as the concentrations of these species in blood is
very low. The third possibility, catalase, has a pH optimum of
approximately pH 7.0, signiﬁcantly different from the optimum

which is responsible for the catalysis of luminol chemilumines-
cence by blood. This conclusion has also been reached by other
researchers (Fig. 8) [13,63].
2.3. Redox reaction mechanism
While the identity of the emitter (3-aminophthalate) has
been established for many years, the mechanism by which it is
produced in an excited state has been the subject of many postu-
lated mechanisms [8,13,20,40,64–68]. A succinct description of
the current understanding of the probable reaction mechanism
accounting for a number of ﬁndings from the aforementioned
authors was given by Barnett and Francis in their recent review
[5]; based on this work and on the previous research especially
by Mer´enyi and co-workers during the 1980s [20,64–68], the
currently most accepted mechanism is presented in Fig. 9.
Luminol in strongly alkaline solutions is deprotonated to the
monoanionic and the dianionic forms, with the former being
prevalent between pH 8 and 14. The deprotonated luminol can
be oxidised, most likely by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin radical
(OH-Fe4+-P•) and also by the hydroxy-ferryl-porphyrin (OH-
Fe4+-P) to form radical intermediates, such as those described
in the reaction with the true peroxidase enzymes, which can then
react to give an diazaquinone [20,68]. The diazaquinone can then
undergo nucleophilic attack from the hydroperoxide ion deriv-
ing from the deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide (pKa 11.7)
[20,39,40,47,68]. This is supported by the chemiluminescence
intensity being dependant upon hydrogen peroxide concentra-
tion, a factor which has been used analytically to determine this
species [24,69]. An alternative path involving attack of super-
oxide (O2−) on the radical may also occur, especially under
conditions where the radical is in low concentration [20].
The postulated mechanism following addition of peroxide
to the diazaquinone (or superoxide to the radical) involves a
cyclic addition of oxygen from the added hydroperoxide to the
othercarbonylcarbonformingacyclicanti-aromaticendoperox-
ide whose bonds are particularly weak. The signiﬁcant amount
of readily available energy contained in this species is then
gained by cleavage and subsequent reorganisation of these
bonds. Since nitrogen is an excellent leaving group because of
the relevant strength of its own bonds (and as a gas, it is also
entropically favoured), the formation of the dicarboxylate anion
by expelling nitrogen gas is favoured. The 3-aminophthalate
dianion so formed is in an electronically excited triplet state (3-
APA*) (two unpaired electrons of the same spin) [8]. This then
undergoes a slow spin-ﬂip process, to an excited singlet state
(two unpaired electrons of different spin) which in turn decays
to the ground state with the emission of light [38,40]. Evidence
for this pathway has been found by studies of diazaquinones
which showed that these molecules give chemiluminescence on
reactions with basic hydrogen peroxide without the need for
catalysts, the emitter being the 3-aminophthalate ion in an elec-
tronically excited state (3-APA*) for the diazaquinone derived
from luminol, with similar species being observed in the case of
related diazaquinones [68].
Light emission is almost instantaneous when luminol is
sprayed on hematin, while with blood there can be a build-up

to a maximum luminescence over a few seconds, followed by a
decay in light intensity (Fig. 10). The half-life of the emission is
rather variable, depending mainly on both the quantity and the
quality of the catalyst, given constant concentrations of luminol,

the oxidant and the base [39,44,70]. In most cases the half-life of
chemiluminescence from blood has been observed to be about
20–40 s, although detectable emission may be viewed for up to
3 min [47,71].
In the conditions typical of luminol forensic testing the inten-
sity of the light is primarily proportional to the concentration of
the metal ion present, given both the oxidizer and the reductant
(luminol) at a constant concentration [5,29].
3. The luminol reaction as a presumptive test for blood
3.1. Operational use of luminol as a presumptive test for
blood
Luminol can be used to detect the presence of minor, unno-
ticed or hidden bloodstains diluted down to a level of 1:106
(1 L of blood in 1 L of solution) [18,63,72]. It can disclose dis-
tribution, allowing bloodstain pattern evaluation occasionally
enabling the investigators to reconstruct some of the events of
a crime by visualizing these patterns [73,74]. Other chemical-
based tests widely employed over the years such as ﬂuorescein,
tetramethylbenzidine, phenolphthalein (Kastle–Meyer reaction)
and leucomalachite green (Medinger reaction), and physical
techniques such as the use of Polilight® (Roﬁn, Dingley, Aus-
tralia) light source in the forensic detection of blood are useful

under speciﬁc circumstances, but do not have the high sensitivity
of luminol [75–77].
Several preparations of luminol have been described and in
recent years new preparations, using either patented luminol
molecule modiﬁcations or luminol blood-dependent chemilu-
minescence enhancers [13,28], have been proposed to improve
sensitivity, speciﬁcity and duration of the emission. How-
ever the two best known formulations for luminol testing,
the ﬁrst described by Grodsky et al. [18] and the sec-
ond described by Weber [19], continue to be the most
extensively used by forensic practitioners due to their good
performance, simplicity of preparation, low cost and ready
availability of the ingredients. These protocols are summarised
in Fig. 11.
Regardless of the preparation, luminol solution is usually
directly sprayed in completely dark environments. The light
obtained can be photographed or ﬁlmed while the luminescent
areas are marked in order to allow their detection once the light
emission has faded [63,78]. Previous pre-treatment of the sur-
faces possessing the stains with 2% hydrochloric acid (HCl),
recommended by some authors [79,80], seems to decrease sen-
sitivity, raising the background chemiluminescence level [73],
and, furthermore, to have detrimental effects for the following
DNA typing attempts [63].
Ampliﬁcation of the luminol chemiluminescent emission by
means of intensiﬁed cameras has been reported in a forensic
context [13,81] but is not in general use at crime scenes.
Due to the potential irritant effects of luminol, harmful effects
of the other compounds employed in both preparations, and to
the fact that luminol is applied as an aerosol, particular care has
to be taken in its use (Table 1). Suitable protective equipment
composed of goggles, respirators, gloves and protective clothes
should be used by the operators when luminol is sprayed and
the area investigated should be aerated after luminol application.
The number of people assisting the operations should be limited
to those strictly necessary [63].
Subsequent to bloodstain location and photograph documen-
tation is the collection of the stains for further laboratory testing.
The collection method depends on the nature of the substrate on
which the stain is located. For unmovable objects such as tiles,
walls or cars the best procedure consists of swabbing the sur-
face with cotton swabs or other highly absorbing support. Many
laboratories use the oral-swabs commonly employed to collect
reference samples in crime cases. This concentrates all of the
available stain in a small area of the swab. Alternatively, in some
cases, the stains may be removed from the surface by scraping
off with a scalpel and collecting the removed material.
When the stains are diffuse on a wide unmovable area, e.g.
on a wall surface, it is possible to employ an adsorbent card
containingpreservativesubstanceswhichprotectthebloodstains
(proteins and DNA as well) from bacterial and fungal hydrolytic
and oxidative degradation [63,82,83].
Formovableobjectssuchasfurniturecomponents,smallpan-
els, carpets and tools, the best and most conservative procedure
consists in the collection of the complete object from which the
stains will be recovered in the laboratory.
Regardless of how the stains are collected, the essential
requirements to be met are the recovery of the available blood,
the collection of a control sample in a tested area not exhibiting
chemiluminescence and the complete drying of the support used
for blood collection in order to avoid the microbial and fungal
degrading action.

3.2. Factors inﬂuencing the use of luminol
While luminol preparation and application is rather simple,
interpretation of results is more challenging. Interpretation of
luminol chemiluminescence characteristics and patterns at the
crime scene should take into consideration the physical struc-
ture of the substrate upon which the bloodstains are found, the
chemical composition of the substrate possessing the stains and
any other substances present on the substrate.
3.2.1. Physical nature of substrate
The ﬁrst issue confronting the forensic practitioner when
using the luminol test at a crime scene is a consideration of the
physicalnatureofthesubstratespossessingthestains[51,63,73].
Substrates can be divided roughly into two groups: absorbent
materials and non-absorbent materials.
Absorbent materials encompass substrates with irregular
porous surfaces such as wood-ﬁnish panelling, walls, and inter-
stitial spaces between tiles or wood objects which, due to the
grooves or cracks onto the surface, show superﬁcial absorbent
properties and are able to keep blood remains, even after vig-
orous scrubbing, for a long time [63,73]. In this group can be
included also substrates with much greater absorbing properties
such as carpeting, leather clothes, fabric clothes, roof-linings,
blankets, etc.
Absorbent materials represent fairly easy surfaces to ana-
lyze because they often can retain signiﬁcant amounts of blood,
maintaining it in relatively undegraded form even for many
years, thus giving intense reaction with the luminol test. This
is primarily due to rapid drying of blood, especially in domes-
tic or covered environments, thus preventing its degradation by
environmental biological agents such as bacterial hydrolytic
enzymes. Moreover, these substrates can protect blood from
physical or chemical environmental agents such as solar rays,
moisture and water, or cleaning attempts after the crime has been
committed [63,73].
Due to the structure and to the relatively large quantity of
blood that may be absorbed, absorbent materials are resistant
to cleaning with bleach and/or soapy water. It is also possible
to spray multiple applications of the luminol reagent with-
out the risk of excessively diluting the stains in order to best
visualize and to successfully photograph the bloodstain pattern
[63,73].
Non-absorbent substrates such as non-textured linoleum,
vinyl, tile, glass, metal and many others, present more difﬁculties
both in the reagent application and in the quality of chemilu-
minescence. These substrate surfaces are unable to effectively
retain and store blood and, moreover, cannot prevent its degra-
dation especially by physical and chemical agents. As clearly
demonstrated by Lytle and Hedgecock [73], these surfaces are
fairly easy to completely clean and a mild washing attempt by
water and soap lead to the removal of the bloodstains yielding
almost non-existent reaction with luminol.
A further complication is that the application of luminol solu-
tions to non-absorbent surfaces can lead to the bloodstain pattern
running, due to the limited retention of the resulting solution
by the smooth surface. This can lead to complete loss of the
bloodstain pattern [63]. Particular care should therefore be used
when dealing with these substrates, particularly when they are
non-horizontal, in order to avoid the loss of the stains. Investi-
gators should ﬁrst use a minimum amount of luminol solution
by rapidly spraying, preferably with a nebulizer, the suspected
area, and avoiding further applications, quickly photograph the
emission [51,63,73].
3.2.2. Inﬂuence of interfering substances
There is a wide range of environmental and pharmaceuti-
cal, domestic and industrial substances which are able to affect
luminol blood-induced chemiluminescence. This may be due to
catalytic activity, their redox properties, or their chemical reac-
tivity with the luminol mixture or with iron in the bloodstains.
Examples of such chemicals are the components of several com-
monly occurring materials such as soils, detergents, bleaches,
carpet, metal objects, tools, plastic panels, wood, and vegetable
compounds.
Compounds which may suppress luminol chemilumines-
cence are summarised in Fig. 12. Ligands with an high
afﬁnity/reactivity for a speciﬁc oxidation state of iron such
as sulﬁde (ferryl ion ligand) or cyanide (ferric ion ligand) or
compounds acting as anti-oxidising species (standard reduc-
tion potential, E0′ < E0′ luminol) such as ascorbate, phenolics,
anilines and thiols [84], may act as molecular traps subtract-
ing either the catalyst (iron ions) or the reductant (luminol),
Fig. 12. Classiﬁcation of compounds suppressing or reducing luminol chemiluminescence.

or may prevent luminol oxidation, respectively. Also quench-
ing (intermolecular electronic energy transfer) or inner-ﬁlter
effects (molecule absorbing at the emission wave-length of the
emitter) from other molecular constituents of the bloodstains
(heme itself, O2, several aminoacids, etc.) or, more likely, of the
substrate possessing the evidence should be regarded as pos-
sible interferents due to their ability to decrease the observed
chemiluminescent/ﬂuorescent intensity [85].
However, in practice, most of these substances are unlikely
to come into contact with blood, with some relevant exceptions
such as polyphenolic derivatives [69,86,87] like tannins which
are widely present in wood. Thus these species do not generally
signiﬁcantly impact on the forensic use of luminol, and false-
negativeresultshavenotbeendescribedintheforensicliterature.
The most problematic chemicals for a correct interpretation
of luminol test results are those which provoke intensiﬁcation or
a generation of a chemiluminescence emission even if blood is
not present, leading to false-positive results. Due to the possible
presence of these substances at the crime scene, the luminol
test must not be considered sufﬁciently speciﬁc to permit an
unequivocal identiﬁcation of blood [15,18,51,88,89].
Those compounds which generate luminol chemilumines-
cence, or enhance the luminol emission in the presence of
bloodstains can be divide into three major categories (Fig. 13):
1. compounds
showing
a
catalytic
true
peroxidase
or
peroxidase-like activity;
2. compounds with a high oxidizing capacity towards luminol;
3. compounds with a complex chemical composition with an
undeﬁned action mechanism towards luminol mixture.
The ﬁrst group encompasses inorganic or bioinorganic
species and undoubtedly is the major source of luminol inter-
ferences as these compounds often show excellent catalysing
properties in redox reactions such as that involving luminol
oxidation and are widely distributed in the environment and
in plants. In general three main types may be characterized in
this group: free metal ions, in most cases included in inorganic
compounds such as rust or soils; biological complexes between
metal ions and organic components (such as metal–porphyrins,
and including bacterial or plant pigments) often within protein
structures; enzymes belonging to the oxidoreductases class such
as horseradish-peroxidases.
Iron compounds, especially in the form of Fe2+ and Fe3+,
are constituents of many inorganic and biological species abun-
dantly distributed in the environment [90–92]. In soils and
sediments, iron is the dominant redox-active element by virtue of
its abundance and favourable reduction potential located mid-
way in the aqueous regime. Iron is the fourth most abundant
element on the earth’s crust and is present in several minerals
such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe2O3), siderite (FeCO3)
or pyrite (FeS2) which may serve as large reservoirs of electron-
buffering capacity in soils and whose surfaces catalyze reactions
that may proceed only slowly, if at all, in bulk solution [93].
InaqueousaerobicenvironmentsandatneutralpHironcanbe
found in highly insoluble crystalline and amorphous hydroxide
andoxideforms[94]includingsuchsubstancesasrust(amixture
of iron oxides and hydroxides with a variable hydration degree
and structural formula [Fe2O3·nH2O]), and these compounds
can also act as catalysts for the luminol reaction [95,96]. Also
many metal objects and baked clays contain iron.
Similarly several other metallic ions such as cobalt,
chromium, nickel, copper, and manganese, which are also found
in soils or metal objects and some chemical products, have been
reported, in various experimental studies, as capable of produc-
ing visible chemiluminescence when exposed to the luminol
solution [42,83,97–99].
Ferric or ferrous ions and other metals ions especially
cobalt, copper, and manganese, are present in some biological
molecules including redox active prosthetic groups. Examples
include the heme proteins peroxidases, catalase, cytochromes,
and non-heme biomolecules such as the iron–sulfur cluster
enzyme aconitase and the electron transfer proteins rubredox-
ins and ferredoxins [100,101]. Storage and transfer proteins
like ferritin or hemosiderin, the main storage forms of iron
in mammals, as well as transferrin, the iron transferring pro-
tein into the blood, contain signiﬁcant concentrations of ferric
ions. In ferritin or hemosiderin iron is incorporated in the min-

eral ferrihydrite form, [FeO(OH)]8[FeO(H2PO4)], whereas in
transferrin it is coordinated to the polypeptidic shell aided by a
carbonate anion cofactor [102]. Other major examples of metal-
containing biomolecules in living organisms include the enzyme
cofactors cobalamin or vitamin B12 (containing Co2+) [103],
and plants and bacterial pigments containing Mg2+ or Mn2+
[90,104]. These compounds intrinsically possess, in suitable
conditions, redox properties of key importance for their chem-
istry and biology [49,105] and are therefore widely distributed
in animal, plants and microorganisms.
Heme containing proteins represent a serious challenge for
luminol test interpretation as they are capable of efﬁciently
catalysing the luminol oxidation reaction. A hemoprotein is a
protein containing a heme prosthetic group, either covalently or
non-covalently bound to the protein itself [49]. The iron in the
heme is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction cycles
usually involving a reversible change from +2 to +3 oxidation
states and vice versa, though stabilized ferryl, Fe4+-containing
compounds, are well known as reaction intermediates in the
peroxidases [90,104]. Heme-proteins are found in such diverse
roles as transport (hemoglobin, myoglobin, transferrin, neu-
roglobin, cytoglobin, and leghemoglobin) [106,107], catalysis
(peroxidases), active membrane transport and electron transfer
(cytochromes) [108].
Peroxidases, found in bacteria, fungi, and animals but most
widely distributed throughout the plants (e.g. horseradish perox-
idase and turnip isoperoxidases), are heme-containing enzymes
(heme b type) belonging to the class of oxidoreductases which
catalyze the oxidation of a substrate by hydrogen peroxide
[109–111].Duetotheirbiochemicalpropertiesperoxidaseshave
been extensively investigated and used for a plethora of ana-
lytical applications especially in biochemistry and molecular
biology. When the reducing compound is luminol, peroxi-
dases are capable of catalyzing its oxidation with a much
higher efﬁciency than any other catalytic species [49,105] and,
for this reason, can produce signiﬁcant levels of chemilu-
minescence, which can be misinterpreted as blood-dependent
[73,112,113].
Of particular relevance in the forensic use of luminol are
the interfering effects from plant peroxidases which are mostly
abundant in ﬁbrous plant material from fruits and vegetables
(including the pulp and juice of fruits) but are also found
with chemical variations among photosynthetic microorganisms
[69,114]. In the presence of these enzymes, and to a lesser extent
with other plant compounds such as the Mn2+ in Photosystem
II [115] and/or the whole chloroplast [116], the luminol test can
produce false positive indications often showing undetectable
differences in light emission characteristics from that seen with
blood [63,114].
The peroxidase-catalyzed chemiluminescent oxidation of
luminol involves the initial formation of highly oxidising
species upon reaction of the oxidant (e.g. H2O2) and peroxi-
dase. In a similar but better understood fashion to the above
described hematin catalytic mechanism in bloodstains, the
ferric-porphyrin prosthetic group of peroxidases undergoes a
redox cycling between ferric, ferryl, and ferryl radical cation
states while luminol (mono or bideprotonated form) is con-
verted to a radical form which undergoes further reaction by the
mechanisms suggested earlier to yield the electronically excited
3-aminophthalate dianion [49,70,117–120].
Commonly encountered examples of the second category
of interferents, namely compounds with strong oxidizing
properties towards luminol, are sodium hypochlorite, potas-
sium permanganate and iodine. These species are present in
many household and industrial chemical solutions, includ-
ing insecticides, cleaning agents, disinfectants or antiseptics
[51,95,121–123].
Hypohalites of chlorine and bromine (hypochlorite, hypo-
bromite) and related oxidants such as N-bromosuccinimide,
1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin and chloramine-T, are well
known as oxidants in chemiluminescent reactions. For example,
the red glow accompanying the reaction between hypochlo-
rite and hydrogen peroxide, was ﬁrst reported by Mallet in
1927 [124]. The activity of these compounds as oxidants in
chemiluminescence reactions has recently been comprehen-
sively reviewed by Francis and co-workers [125] as powerful
reagents in a wide range of analytically useful reactions because
of their relevant oxidising properties.
Hypochlorite (OCl−), a common component of domestic
and industrial bleaches, was one of the ﬁrst reagents used
to induce the brilliant blue emission accompanying the oxi-
dation of luminol [1] and it has been the subject of several
qualitative and quantitative studies [126–129]. Hypochlorite is
classiﬁed as a medium-strong oxidant with a standard reduction
potential (E0′) of 0.841 V (referring to the reduction reac-
tion OCl−+ H2O + 2e−→Cl−+ 2OH−) [130] and is capable
of amplifying the chemiluminescence emission in luminol oxi-
dation by hydrogen peroxide when both the compounds are
present in the reaction medium [130]. In 1991, Arnhold et
al. [69] found a linear relationship between concentration of
hydrogen peroxide and light intensity in the concentration
range 5 × 10−8 to 7.5 × 10−6 mol/L with a maximum ampliﬁca-
tion level (550-fold) at 7.5 × 10−6 mol/L H2O2. The increased
chemiluminescence of the luminol reaction in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite is probably due to
the hypochlorite being able to generate the diazaquinone inter-
mediate efﬁciently, with this then rapidly reacting with peroxide.
The chemiluminescence spectra of these reactions showed a
wavelength maximum at 431 nm independent of the concentra-
tion of hydrogen peroxide. This value was similar to published
chemiluminescence emission maximum for luminol oxidation
without sodium hypochlorite (425 nm) in other experimental
systems suggesting that hydrogen peroxide was a necessary
component in the chemiluminescent oxidation of the luminol
by sodium hypochlorite [44,131].
Investigations by Brestel [132] and Gorova et al. [133]
showed that the luminol redox reaction involving sodium
hypochlorite had a pathway similar to that described for other
oxidising species such as sodium perborate or hydrogen perox-
ide as described in a previous section, although Eriksen et al.
suggested that hypochlorite can form the diazaquinone without
the intermediate formation of a radical [64]. Hypochlorite is thus
one of the most important examples of substantial interfering
substances, as it is widely distributed throughout the domes-

tic environment and can cause positive interference with the
common luminol sprays including Grodsky’s or Weber’s formu-
lations [18,19]. In addition, it may be used in an attempt to clean
up a crime scene and remove blood evidence via its oxidation
and physical elimination [134,135].
The ﬁnal category of interfering substances covers a range of
compounds which can be found in materials such as domestic
and commercial oils, various glues, carpets, sinks, automobile
seats,paintsandvarnishes,andmanykindsofsoils[63,114,135].
These substances are often able to catalyse the chemilumines-
cence almost as effectively as does the blood, but, due to their
complex chemical composition, the exact mechanism underly-
ing these interferences is not yet completely understood.
3.3. Interpretation of luminol test results
Luminol emission pattern interpretation can involve a quali-
tative statement of the luminescence pattern characteristics and
an evaluation of emission spectra characteristics (maximum
emission wavelength and emission intensity) [114,134,136]. In
addition attempts can be made to inhibit or at least reduce the
interferences of chemiluminescence deriving from the reaction
of luminol with substances other than blood by using chemical
species followed by an emission intensity measurement [47,71].
The latter approach however has only been employed success-
fully for hypochlorite bleach-induced chemiluminescence.
Generally visual examination is used when the luminol test
is employed in a forensic situation, rather than instrumental
detection of the luminescence. An experienced practitioner may
distinguish the true blood-catalyzed chemiluminescence from
that produced by other substances by the evaluation of param-
eters observable to the naked eye such as emission intensity,
duration and spatial distribution. However this approach may
also lead to misinterpretation, due to a subjective, informal and
non-quantitative evaluation, for example, because its intensity is
qualitatively much weaker than that expected for blood. In other
circumstances an emission of similar intensity may be thought
to derive from diluted bloodstains and is accepted. Therefore,
caution should be exercised when using the test. Any confusion
which may arise over a stain can usually be resolved by an intel-
ligent observation and, if necessary, by further testing [73], for
example, by using a different presumptive test for blood, such as
the immunochromatographic test for the conﬁrmation of human
blood presence Hexagon OBTI (Human GmbH, Wiesbaden,
Germany) [137].
In practice false positives with metals are rarely a problem
as these can usually be anticipated or resolved by careful obser-
vation of the crime scene. Interfering solid substances such as
metal objects or surfaces that are coated homogeneously with
these substances (e.g. some varnishes and paints) generally show
different and distinguishable emission patterns with respect to
both the spatial distribution and, often, the emission intensity of
luminescence. Upon reaction with metals both emission kinetics
and intensity of chemiluminescence are rather characteristic: the
emission will be twinkling and intense but short, while a luminol
reaction with blood will produce an intense, long-lasting, even
glow. Moreover, an interfering chemiluminescence, especially
from solid object such as a water valve, a knife, a copper pipe,
a ﬂoor, a carpet or a soil, will reproduce the shape, the com-
position, the contours and the dimensions of the object while
luminol emission patterns with blood will appear as spatters,
wipes, smears, drag marks or even footwear impressions.
The presence of hypochlorite-based bleaches on non-porous
surfaces being sprayed is sometimes recognizable and can be
identiﬁed by an experienced forensic practitioner as it leads to
bright ﬂashes of chemiluminescence as opposed to the more
gradual development of chemiluminescence by blood.
One operational advantage of the luminol test is the ability
to highlight the presence of scattered, very small droplets of
blood by the individual ‘sparkles’ of blue chemiluminescence
produced by each droplet. This makes this test easier to inter-
pret then the other three common presumptive tests for blood
(thebenzidine,phenolphthaleinandleuco-malachitechromogen
tests) [51,77].
In theory, a quantitative evaluation of emission spectra (max-
imum emission wavelength and emission intensity) could be
used to reduce the interferences of chemiluminescence deriving
from the reaction of luminol with substances other than blood
by using chemical species. Recently, Quickenden and Creamer
[114] and Quickenden and Cooper [134] in a series of studies
have used instrumental methods to examine the emission of light
from the luminol test in order to investigate the potential to dis-
criminate between true-positive and false positive results, and
occasionally false negatives. These studies included investigat-
ing the potential for distinguishing between human hemoglobin
and other species on the basis of spectral shifts of the wavelength
of maximum emission. They also carried out comprehensive
studies of the luminol chemiluminescence emission elicited
by a wide range of common potentially interfering substances
such as vegetable and fruit smears, pulps and juices and house-
hold/industrial chemicals such as cleaning agents, insecticides,
glues, paints and varnishes. Of the 250 substances examined,
they identiﬁed only a small number which produced chemilu-
minescence comparable to that of hemoglobin (Table 2): turnips,
parsnips, horseradish, commercial bleach (sodium hypochlo-
rite), copper metal, some furniture polishes, some enamel paints
and some interior fabrics from automobiles [136].
Creamer et al. also studied [135] the serious issue of the
hypochloriteinterferenceeffectwiththeluminoltest[126].They
observed that when a person attempts to remove bloodstains by
washing the area with water or sodium hypochlorite solution,
depending on the thoroughness of the clean, the effect on the
luminescence spectrum could range from the complete absence
of emission to various combinations of blood-initiated emission
and hypochlorite-initiated emission (each peaking at its separate
respective wavelength) which might be expected if the cleaning
process is not complete.
Finally the same group examined in a recent study a speciﬁc
kind of crime scene, namely the interior of an automobile, taking
into consideration both the effect of potential interferences from
the internal ﬁttings of the vehicle but also the effect of high
temperature within the vehicle of the efﬁcacy of the test [138].
The effects of attempts to wash hemoglobin from the interior of
the vehicles tested using a variety of cleaning methods were also

investigated. It was found that there was little interference from
materials within the three automobiles tested, although some
surfaces did elicit weak luminol chemiluminescence. Attempts
to remove hemoglobin with water alone were not successful,
however soapy water or a proprietary car cleaner removed a
signiﬁcant proportion of the hemoglobin from the tested surface
(ca. 90%). Soap and water and cleaners produced better results
than plain water because they have the ability to solvate the
globin proteins more effectively.
The effect of increased car interior temperature lead to
improved sensitivity and chemiluminescence emission intensity
of the test and this was hypothesized to be due to thermal con-
version of hemoglobin to methemoglobin in the presence of
molecular oxygen.
3.4. Improvements to luminol formulations
To minimize luminol interferences and/or to increase the
yield of the chemiluminescence emission other approaches have
been investigated over the years. These include the use of deriva-
tives and analogues of luminol, a variation in the order of mixing
of the reagents, the pre-treatment of the substrate to be tested
with chemical substances and, ﬁnally, the addition to the lumi-
nol mixture preparation of chemical additives which selectively
react with the putative interfering species reducing their avail-
ability for the reaction with luminol.
Ewetz and Thore in 1975 described a modiﬁed luminol-
perborate assay in which experimental samples were pre-treated
with a solution of 0.1 M NaOH before adding a luminol prepa-
ration without perborate, followed by treatment with a solution
of perborate [88]. They observed a reduced light emission from
isolated Fe2+ ions to a low constant value independent of concen-
tration, whereas in hematin compounds the light emission was
stoichiometrically related to these molecules allowing identiﬁ-
cation of the two emission proﬁles based on the reaction kinetics.
This effect could be probably due mainly to the dissociation of
globin portion of the proteins tested from the prosthetic group
following the pre-treatment with NaOH [139]. The incubation
with an alkali solution exposed the hematin making it available
for the luminol reaction while free Fe3+ is mostly complexed
withOH−ionstoformFe(OH)3 whichispoorlysoluble.Despite
this pioneering study being primarily aimed at deﬁning a quanti-
tative analytical assay for the selective determination of hematin
compounds in environmental chemistry, it was one of the ﬁrst
attempts to increase the luminol test selectivity by changing the
traditional test procedures. However this approach has never
been successfully applied to the forensic ﬁeld but was restricted
only to laboratory based analytical applications.
More recently, several advances in the identiﬁcation of chem-
icals interfering with the chemiluminescent reaction of luminol
with hypochlorite have been made, and these provide insight
into how hypochlorite interferences might be reduced in a foren-
sic context. Most notably, Arnhold et al. [86], investigating the
inhibitory action of some biological species towards chemilu-
minescent reaction in the luminol–H2O2–NaOCl system under
biological pH conditions, found that several of these species
could directly interact with NaOCl. Most substances tested such
as thiourea, cysteine, human serum albumin, ascorbic acid or
methionine, acted as competitors with luminol for the interaction
with NaOCl due to either thiol or amino groups, the former being
easily oxidized by NaOCl, the latter reacting with NaOCl to form
chloramines. In both cases these functional groups were able to
scavenge NaOCl, subtracting it from the reaction with lumi-
nol. Again, despite the interesting ﬁndings no effective attempts
to use chemical additives to increase the selectivity of luminol
forensic formulations (Grodsky’s or Weber’s formulations) have
found widespread application.
More recently however the successful use of a chemical
species preventing luminol emission by interfering compounds
has been reported by Kent et al. in their studies into reducing
the effect of hypochlorite-containing bleaches [71]. In previous
analytical chemistry papers, Gray et al. [140], Margerum et al.
[141], and Antelo et al. [142,143] had described the reaction of
amines with hypochlorous acid to form chloramines according
to the following equation:
RR′NH + HOCl ⇌RR′NCl + H2O
where R, R′ are H or alkyl, and had showed that the reaction rate
between hypochlorite and amines is pH dependent and depends
on the basicity of the amine.
Kent et al. investigated whether primary and secondary
amines could inhibit the chemiluminescence due to hypochlo-
rite under the alkaline conditions typical of forensic luminol tests
(Grodsky’s or Weber’s formulations), and whether the presence
of amines had an effect on the heme-catalyzed luminescence
of luminol [71]. The authors observed an inhibition of bleach-
induced chemiluminescence by amines, the effect being increas-
ing with the alkalinity of the amines. The best inhibition effects
(almost complete inhibition) were obtained with strongly basic
amines such as 1,2-diaminoethane since these were the most
effective competitors for hypochlorite under the conditions of
common forensic sprays (those reported by Grodsky and Weber

both lead to pH > 10). The amines did not interfere signiﬁcantly
with the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation and only slightly
reduced the chemiluminescence observed from blood still assur-
ing a satisfactory intensity and longevity of light emission,
sufﬁcient to be effectively used in a forensic context. A major
disadvantage to this approach to reduce hypochlorite effect on
luminol emission was the toxicity of amines involved. In a fol-
low up study, King and Miskelly conﬁrmed the above results but
they also found that the far less toxic amino acid glycine was
very nearly as effective as an additive as the amines [47].
In the above studies it was also noted that if the bloodstain
could be left to air for a period of 1–2 days, the hypochlorite
would decompose and thus no longer interfere with a standard
luminol treatment. This effect has also been reported by
Creamer et al. in 2005 [135] who found that the interference
effect by bleach decreased if the area to be sprayed were left
for several days allowing to the bloodstains to thoroughly dry,
as the hypochlorite decomposes, thus dissipating its effect on
luminol emission.
Lastly, a new luminol-based formulation (patented) called
Bluestar® Forensic (ROC Import Group, Monte Carlo, Monaco)
was recently developed in an attempt to eliminate some incon-
veniences (especially low emission intensity, brief lifespan of
the emission and shortness of the solution life) associated with
luminol sprays. Recent papers have compared the performance
of Bluestar® Forensic luminol spray to typical luminol prepa-
rations (Grodsky’s and Weber’s formulations) [144,145]. These
papers concluded that Bluestar® Forensic provided convenience
of preparation (easy to mix in the ﬁeld), that chemiluminescence
was sufﬁciently intense and long-lasting that it could be visu-
alised in the presence of some ambient light, and that emission
intensity was still reasonable when a bloodstain was resprayed.
Moreover, Bluestar® Forensic was described as a more sta-
ble formulation since it could be used for several days after
mixing, possibly due to it containing urea peroxide as a stable
oxidant. It is claimed that Bluestar® Forensic is not destructive
to DNA, whereas other Bluestar® Forensic formulations (for
hunters and for training) can adversely affect DNA analysis (for
more information, please visit the website http://www.bluestar-
forensic.com).
3.5. Sample collection and effect on serological and DNA
analyses
Once a bloodstain has been located and photographed it can
be sampled for further serological and genetic analyses [63,73]
as described in an earlier section. Once the blood residues have
been collected the forensic biologist may proceed in two ways:
further presumptive test for blood detection may be performed in
order to conﬁrm the human hematic nature of the stains or, more
likely, direct DNA extraction aimed at DNA typing procedures
may be carried out [63,72].
As the luminol test has been employed to detect blood stains
that otherwise would not have been revealed due to the limited
amount of the blood present, in most cases it is preferred to
directly perform DNA typing procedures in order to avoid a par-
tial loss of the already small amount of blood. Nevertheless over
the years many attempts have been made to better characterize
the recovered bloodstains by using both additional presumptive
tests and DNA typing analyses.
A major advantage of the luminol test is the lack of signif-
icant damage to the genetic material, especially when modern
PCR techniques are employed to analyze microsatellite DNA.
Only moderate adverse effects have been noted over the years
when other DNA testing procedures or serological markers were
commonly used for identiﬁcation purposes.
Early studies by Specht [15], Proesher and Moody [16], and
McGrath [17] in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century demonstrated
the absence of interfering effects between luminol solution and
other conﬁrmatory tests performed after the luminol test.
Lytle and Hedgecock in 1978 [73] mentioned the non-dest-
ructive and preservative properties of the luminol solution to-
wards other serological assays as it did not prevent subsequent
identiﬁcation tests or ABO blood grouping analyses. However,
they did report an interference with the electrophoretic analyses
aimed at typing of enzymes, such as erythrocyte acid phosphat-
ase and phosphoglucomutase, which were important at that time.
Duncan et al. [146], investigating common ﬁngerprint devel-
oping agents, showed that luminol had no destructive effects on
catalytic examinations, crystal tests for hemoglobin, species test
or elution method for the detection of blood group antigens, but
again noted that it could seriously affect electrophoretic typing
of enzymes.
Grispino in 1990 [147], employing a luminol preparation
according to Specht [15] and a modiﬁed formulation of this
original solution followed by several blood conﬁrmatory tests,
found no signiﬁcant detrimental effects on presumptive tests,
Takayama conﬁrmatory test or species tests. However, a dimin-
ished ability of ABO blood grouping by absorption elution and a
complete loss of electrophoretic band patterns in blood enzyme
typing were observed, likely due to the denaturing action of the
luminol mixture.
A comprehensive study by Laux in 1991 [148] conﬁrmed and
extended these results.
The minor detrimental effects noted by these authors were
likely due to the capability of the luminol preparations (and not
necessarily to the luminol molecule itself) to react with DNA
or proteins. The presence of mild-strong oxidizing compounds
such as perborate may provoke oxidative damage to proteins
[149,150] and, also, on pyrimidine and purine nitrogenous bases
leading to the fragmentation of the DNA double helix [150].
The very high pH used for the luminol test (pH ∼11) may
lead to alkaline hydrolysis of both peptide bonds in proteins
[151] and N-glycosidic bonds between the 2-deoxyribose and
the nitrogen base of DNA leading to an abasic site where the
phosphodiester bond on the polydeoxyribosephosphate strand
may undergo subsequent hydrolysis [150,152].
Hochmeister et al. [153], testing for the ﬁrst time the effects
of presumptive reagent such as luminol, benzidine, phenolph-
thalein, orthotolidine, leumalachite green, and other chemicals
on a subsequent DNA typing procedures and on semen stains
found that evidentiary body ﬂuid stains treated still could be
successfully typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) procedures.

911
In the last 15 years, RFLP have been replaced by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) coupled to the employment of microsatel-
lite short tandem repeats (STRs) DNA [154–156] which allows
forensic biologists to obtain DNA typing results from mini-
mal amounts of biological material, previously insufﬁcient for
a successful RFLP procedure [157].
Cresap et al. [158], investigating the effects of both luminol
solution and Coomassie Blue on DNA ampliﬁcation by PCR
reported that the PCR procedure was completely unaffected by
these assays in a wide range of blood concentrations.
Since the studies of Cresap et al., the results obtained in
a number of studies clearly indicated that it was possible to
recover adequate amounts of DNA suitable for STRs typing by
the PCR technique from luminol-treated bloodstains. Luminol
did not adversely affect, at least in a detectable manner, either
microsatellite DNA stability or DNA extraction methods or PCR
chemistry. For example, in a comprehensive paper of 1999 Gross
et al. [159] found that the standard treatment according to Grod-
sky et al. [18] had no detrimental effects on the PCR testing,
with the DNA yield and the ability to type the bloodstains using
PCR-based technologies being mainly dependent on the nature
of the substrate and the method of cleaning.
Fregeau et al. [72] investigated whether the commonest blood
enhancement reagents could interfere with the subsequent DNA
extraction procedures and with AmpFlSTR® Proﬁler PlusTM
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) ﬂuorescent STRs
DNA analysis. Fresh or aged bloody ﬁngerprints on various
porous and non-porous surfaces were extracted and typed after
short-term exposure (less than 54 days) to a range of chemicals
including luminol on linoleum, glass, metal, pine white-painted
wood, some kinds of clothing and paper. DNA yields before
and after treatment indicated a reduction in the quantity of DNA
recovered from bloody ﬁngerprints by a factor of 2–12 proba-
bly because of the effect on the integrity of the DNA molecules
which could potentially compromise DNA typing analysis in
the case of small stains. Nevertheless they noted no adverse
effects on the PCR ampliﬁcation of the nine STRs systems sur-
veyed or of the gender determination marker Amelogenin when
chemical enhancement of bloodmarks using any of the selected
compounds was conducted for a term below 54 days of exposure.
ThisstudydemonstratedthatPCRSTRsDNAtypingprocedures
were robust and provided excellent and effective results even
when used after exposure to different enhancement chemicals.
In a contemporaneous study, Della Manna and Montpetit
[160] investigated the capability of routinely isolating and
recovering amounts of DNA suitable for PCR typing from
luminol-treated latent bloodstains. They noted that adequate
amounts of DNA suitable for PCR typing at all of the Promega
PowerPlex® 1.1 (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA)
loci upon post luminol treated bloodstains could be effectively
recovered.
4. Conclusions
Luminol has always been considered by the international
forensic community a fascinating but, at the same time, an
“obscure” chemical compound. Despite of its “age” and the
numerous attempts to reveal the chemical mechanism of light
emission, the interferences from substances other than blood and
how the reaction could be improved for forensic purposes are
still not completely understood even in experimental controlled
systems. Nevertheless, despite these issues, luminol continues to
provoke great interest and to represent a challenge because it has
revealed itself in practice to be an affordable, sensitive and sim-
ple detection system for invisible bloodstains detection with few
detrimental effects on the subsequent DNA recovery and typing.
However, the undoubted chemical complexity of the emission
reaction and the presence of several substances interfering with
the reaction and potentially leading to incorrect results, should
oblige the forensic practitioner to know these disadvantages in
order to carefully deal with them and to properly use the “cold
light” test at the crime scene.
