Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is an integral part of crime scene investigation. For violent crimes
involving gunshots, standard practice in police departments worldwide have some physical limitations.
For instance, the effect of gravity and air drag on trajectories of blood droplets are neglected using current
reconstruction methods, which results in a well-known overestimation of the height of the source of
blood. As a consequence, more sophisticated models for blood spatter trajectory reconstruction are being
developed, two of which are highlighted in the present work. They allow the prediction of bloodstain
patterns produced from backward spattered blood droplets from blunt and sharp bullets. Our recent
models attribute the splashing of blood to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability which arises when blood is
accelerated towards lighter air. This physically-based description comes with the powerful predictive
capability to correlate features of bloodstain patterns with the speciﬁc bullet and gun that produced
them, as well as with the body position. The results of the numerical models were compared with four
experiments simulating blood spatter deposition on a vertical wall through the number of stains
produced, average stain area, and average impact angle at the surface, and the agreement found is fairly
good. Moreover, further insight is obtained by probing and explaining the inﬂuence of observable
parameters on the resulting spatter pattern, with the goal of aiding BPA experts evaluating a crime scene.

1. Introduction
Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) is the inspection of blood
spatter patterns which were produced due to violent crimes [1].
The goal of BPA is to provide answers to questions arising from the
scene of a violent crime such as what caused these patterns.
Determination of the region of origin of the blood spatter is
expected from the BPA community [2], however, current techni-
ques lack a fundamental basis in ﬂuid mechanics [3]. Namely, the
method of strings, or the trigonometric method, which has been in
use since as early as the 1950s [4] and is implemented in widely
distributed software [5–9], neglects physical realities such as
gravity and air drag [2]. Understandably, this results in signiﬁcant
well-established errors [10,11], for example, there can be a 50%
overestimation of the height of the region of origin [12]. Moreover,
the widely used formula for the determination of the impact angle
of a blood droplet, sin α = W/L [13], where W is the width of the
stain and L is the length, has major ﬂaws since the values of sine of
the impact angle are practically indistinguishable between 75 and
90. Namely, they vary from 0.97 for 75 and 1 for 90, and is the
reason that standard BPA practice encourages stains with impact
angles less than 60 be used for reconstruction [1].
Adding to the difﬁculty of an accurate reconstruction model of
blood spatter patterns is the rheological complexity of blood. Blood
is a non-Newtonian, shear thinning [14–16] complex aqueous
solution containing various cells and proteins in plasma, and
begins to coagulate as soon as it is outside of the human body
[17,18]. Moreover, 
its rheological behavior depends on 
the
hematocrit [14,19], it exhibits viscoelasticity [16,19–21] and
possesses a yield stress [22]. This rheological behavior is important
in crime scene reconstruction because it can affect the atomization
process [23–26], which is diminished in liquids which exhibit
viscoelastic properties [26–28]. Resultant droplet sizes are also
inﬂuenced by these effects [29–34] as well as their ﬁnal impact on
surfaces [31,35,36]. Additionally, blood droplets are spattered at
body temperature and often are subject in ﬂight to air at a different
temperature, the effects of which have been investigated [37], but
never in the context of BPA.
With some of these challenges in mind, several models have
been developed to attempt to better recreate crime scenes.
Including the effect of drag via a probabilistic approach was
proposed in Refs. [38,39]. Further still, in Ref. [40], both gravity and

air drag were accounted for which allowed for the region of origin
of the bloodstains to be determined with about four times the
accuracy over the method of strings. However, these methods do
not explain and consider how blood droplets form due to a
gunshot. Rather, they take existing bloodstain patterns and
reconstruct blood droplet trajectories without considering the
physical causes of droplet formation. This was mitigated in Refs.
[41] and [42] by linking the resultant backward ﬂow ﬁeld of blood
from a bullet impact to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, and then, to
the droplet formation and trajectories, determined by gravity, air
drag, and droplet-droplet aerodynamic interactions. The Rayleigh–
Taylor instability arises when denser blood is accelerating towards
lighter air [43], as is the case of blood backward spatter splashing
due to a gunshot. Recently, spatter patterns resulting from blood
droplets in the direction of bullet motion, i.e. forward spatter, was
explored in detail and shown to be fundamentally different from
backward spatter [44,45].
In the present work, the experimental investigations of Refs.
[41] and [42] were expanded upon and directly compared with
their respective predictive models. Moreover, the models are
utilized to offer further insight by predicting the locations of the
stain area corresponding to a 50% cumulative distribution and the
geometric centroid of the stains as a function of distance to
impingement. The experiments are described in Section 2, a brief
overview of the predictive models is given in Section 3 along with
the comparison with the data and further insights, and ﬁnally,
conclusions are drawn in Section 4.
2. Experimental investigations
The experiments in this paper are a subset of an open source
data set of high-resolution (600 DPI) scanned images of blood
spatter from a gunshot [46]. There, the experimental conditions
are 
described 
in 
detail, 
and 
allows 
the 
forensic 
science
community to test their models on publicly available data.
Backward spattered blood droplets due to a gunshot were
created at the Izaak Walton League Park indoor shooting range
in Ames, Iowa, USA. While the indoor shooting range provided
quiescent air for the experiments, the environmental conditions
varied with the time of the year of the speciﬁc experiments.
Relative humidity was measured between 44% and 76%, with a
precision of 5% and room temperature was between 14.5 and
23.5 C. The riﬂe used was a 0.223 cal Rock River Arms, LAR-15
1600 barrel M-4, ﬁt with a Yanki YHM Phantom 223 suppressor
ﬁring two different types of bullets, one hollow point, and the
other full metal jacket. The hollow point bullet was a BEE
0.224 cal with a 0.223 Remington casing, 26.5 grain BLC-2
powder, and Winchester Small Riﬂe Primer. The full metal jacket
bullet was a 5.56 mm caliber Federal Ammunition XM193 with a
mass of 55 grain. The velocity of the hollow point bullet was
measured with a chronograph as 897 m/s, and the full metal
jacket bullet was measured to be 922 m/s.
The bullets were shot at either a closed hollow cavity or
polyurethane foam sheet ﬁlled with 10–13 mL of swine blood. For
the experiments conducted with the soaked foam target, the blood
was anticoagulated with ACD and had 41% hematocrit. The
temperature of the blood injected into the foam was 35  2 oC.
For the experiments where blood was contained in a closed hollow
cavity, the blood was used at room temperature and anti-
coagulated with heparin and had 38–39% hematocrit. In each
case, the blood was drawn two days before the experiment was
conducted. A schematic of the experimental setup is depicted in
Fig. 1.
Having 
in 
mind 
the 
effect 
of 
expanding 
muzzle 
gases
interacting with blood droplets in ﬂight [47], the experimental
setup was designed such that the bullet penetrated through a sheet
of cardstock which acted as a diffuser to obstruct the muzzle gases
from travelling downstream. The substrate which was impacted by
the blood droplets was smooth cardstock.
3. Predictive models
The impact phenomenon of a bullet in which the backward
spatter of blood results from is a short-term event. Given a bullet
penetration depth of h  1 cm, and a bullet impact velocity of
V0  300 m=s, the penetration time is t  33 ms which indicates
that inertial forces dominate over the viscous ones. The strong,
short-term impact of 
a 
blunt 
bullet 
results in 
an 
almost
instantaneous pressure ﬁeld which generates backward ﬂow in
the framework of potential impulsive ﬂow hydrodynamics with
pressure being the potential [48–50]. For a Newtonian viscous
liquid, such an impulsive irrotational potential impact ﬂow sets in
when the dimensionless group mu/(Lp) 1, where m is the
viscosity, u is the ﬂuid velocity (in the ﬂow starting from rest), p is
the pressure acting on ﬂuid, and L is the characteristic length scale.
On the other hand, penetration of a sharp bullet proceeds under
dominant inertial forces, and thus, is potential in the ordinary
hydrodynamic sense. The latter case corresponds to the seminal
Wagner problem [50,51]. Potential ﬂows are irrotational and
remain as such for the entire duration of the aforementioned ﬂows
under the conditions of Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem [48–50].
Accordingly, the methods developed to predict backward
splashed blood ﬂow resulting from sharp [41] and blunt bullets
[42] are based on their corresponding incompressible potential
ﬂows which satisfy the Laplace equation with appropriate
boundary conditions. A diagram of the two cases with their
variable deﬁnitions is shown in Fig. 2.
For a blunt bullet the initial blood velocity, v, and acceleration,
A, at the target surface are, respectively,

where a is the radius of the edge of the blunt bullet, r is the radial
coordinate with the origin at the axis of symmetry, and c a
dimensionless factor associated with the time scale of the
impulsive motion [42].

Z–X plane) to the path of the bullet which was aimed at the target center.

The factor c is dictated by the time scale of impulsive motion
[42] which is a function of the impact velocity of the bullet.
However, this factor most likely does not drastically change from
bullet to bullet, even though their impact velocities may be
drastically different. The reason for this is that the timescale of
impact phenomena with a bullet is very short, regardless of the
bullet type.
For the initial moments of penetration of a sharp bullet, the
initial velocity and acceleration of the blood at the target surface
are respectively,
v ¼ u2V0h
r
; 
ð3Þ
A ¼ u2V2
0
r
; 
ð4Þ
where u is the semi-angle of the bullet generatrix, and h is the
depth of bullet penetration which is a function of the time since
impact, t. Note that the depth of bullet penetration h can be
predicted as a function of time t, for example, using Eqs. (17) and
(18) from Ref. [41].
Eqs. (2) and (4) describe the acceleration of denser blood at the
free surface towards lighter air. Such a situation is inherently
unstable and results in the Rayleigh–Taylor instability [43]. This
instability results in the characteristic droplet sizes, l, issued
backward from the free surface, which is given by the following
expression,
l ¼
2p
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
rA=ð3sÞ
p
w; 
ð5Þ
where r is the density of the blood (1060 kg/m3 [16]), s is its
surface tension (60.45 mN/m [16]), and w is a dimensionless factor.
A possible variation of the density and surface tension with
temperature is not included in the models discussed here, because
for liquids, surface tension variation in a reasonable temperature
interval is not large, and, moreover, surface tension s enters Eq. (5)
as
ﬃﬃﬃs
p , which minimizes the effect of temperature even further. The
density variation with temperature is practically insigniﬁcant.
The Rayleigh–Taylor instability links the ﬂow ﬁeld of blood in
the target splashed backward by a gunshot to the generation of
individual droplets, a link which common BPA techniques such as
the method of strings, do not contain. This makes the aforemen-
tioned models [41,42] physical in nature, i.e. linking the blood
spatter pattern to the bullet shape and the gunshot parameters.
Note also that in Ref. [42], the spray angle of blood droplets from
the target with respect to the axis of the bullet was predicted to be
13 using the hydrodynamic theory of turbulent submerged jets.
The splashed blood droplet trajectories are predicted by models
[41,42] using momentum balance equations accounting for the
effects of gravity and air drag affected by droplet-droplet
aerodynamic interactions (the latter being a collective effect).
This collective effect stems from the entrainment of air by the
leading droplets, the aerodynamic wake of which diminishes air
drag on the subsequent droplets and can even accelerate them, as
shown in Ref. [52] and highlighted in Fig. 3. This is similar to a ﬂock
of geese ﬂying in V-formation where the leading goose experiences
larger air drag than those behind it and thus essentially pulls the
others. Eventually, the leading goose will be switched to a position
in the back of the formation and this results in a ﬂock which can ﬂy
further [53]. The bullet used to create the velocity history plot of
Fig. 3 closely resembles a sharp one and as such can help further
validate the framework of the models. The range of initial velocities
predicted with Eq. (3) is superimposed on Fig. 3 and shows that the
calculated values are appropriate. Furthermore, the data used in
Fig. 3 allows for an average 2D area to be found from the droplets
which experimentally was 0.084 mm2, whereas assuming a
circular area with the diameter calculated in Eq. (5), the theory
predicts an average droplet area of 0.079 mm2.
For the simulation of the backward spatter of blood on a vertical
wall (cf. Fig. 1), the cardstock target was discretized into 10 even
rings spanning the minimum and maximum radial distances from
the bullet penetration hole. The median distance of each ring from
the center of the hole is R. For the number of stains, the stains in
each ring were added together, for the stain area and impact angle,
they were averaged in each ring. Comparisons of the predicted and

initial velocities predicted using Eq. (3) are shown.

measured number of stains resulting from the sharp and blunt
bullets are shown in Fig. 4.
The resultant stain area, S, is a function of the droplet ﬁnal
velocity and size, which is ampliﬁed on impact according to the
spread factor [29,54,55], as well as the ﬁnal impact angle, α,
reckoned from the vertical as Ref. [13],

where j is the droplet spread factor calculated with the Reynolds
number of the impacting blood droplet at high shear rates, mShear ¼

are predicted from Eqs. (3) and (5), respectively. After that, the
trajectories are calculated as described in Ref. [42], and then, the
spreading factor j is found from Eq. (29) in Ref. [42].

stain area (it should be emphasized that this is averaged in each
ring) is shown in Fig. 5.
The average impact angles predicted and measured under the
same conditions as in Figs. 4 and 5 are shown in Fig. 6.
The two predictive models of backward spatter of blood [41,42]
can offer further insight to better understand various physical
scenarios which BPA experts can use to quantitatively analyze
crime scenes. Applying both models with the same parameters
ﬁtted to the experiments used in Figs. 4–6 and changing the
distance between the blood source and the vertical cardstock
target from 25 to 250 cm in steps of 25 cm, allows for cross-
sections of the evolution of the blood droplet spray to be seen. The
cumulative stained area was plotted as a function of the area of the
stains in the spatter, a statistical concept that has been found useful
to describe beating spatters [56]. Then, the value corresponding to
50% of the cumulative distribution, denoted as A50 and plotted as a
function of the vertical substrate location, is shown in Fig. 7.
The best ﬁt lines of Fig. 7 are useful for interpolating distance
between those at which data points were taken. An appropriate ﬁt

Þ=D and the values of the parameters are listed in
Table 2.
It is interesting to note that in Fig. 7, the sharp bullet produces
larger droplets and at closer vertical deposition distances than its
blunt bullet counterpart. The prediction from the numerical
simulations in Fig. 7 that A50 reaches a maximum at an
intermediate distance between blood source and vertical target
spatter was tested against a series of gunshot backspatter
experiments from Ref. [46]. As Fig. 8 shows, both experiments
and numerical simulations show a comparable maximum for A50 at
a distance of about 75–90 cm. This agreement between experi-
ments and numerical simulations is a sign that the developed
model captures the relevant ﬂuid dynamics. Moreover, it opens a
path towards quantitative crime scene reconstruction of the
relative position of the blood source and the spatter based on a
statistical examination of the stains.
The A50 value for each vertical deposition distance acts as a
border between the small and large droplets. The geometric
centroids, CY, of those less than or equal to this value as compared
to those larger than A50, can help facilitate a qualitative analysis
performed by BPA experts on the distance to the vertical impact
substrate by comparing to the quantitative analysis below. Plotting
the lowest bounded centroid (from droplets > A50) and the highest
bounded centroid (from droplets  A50) as a function of the
vertical deposition distance is seen in Fig. 9.
Note that CY becomes the same and equal to approximately
60 cm for both bullet types after a certain distance. The best ﬁt
lines of Fig. 8 were found based off of the average of the two
centroids and a good ﬁt was found with a simple exponential decay
function,

4. Conclusion
A series of experiments were conducted by the present group
and the resultant experimental images with the raw data
deposited in Ref. [46]. Four of those sets of experimental data
were chosen and compared with the physically based models for
sharp [41], and blunt bullets [42]. These models predict that the
Rayleigh–Taylor 
instability 
is 
responsible 
for 
blood 
droplet
formation in backward spatter and their initial size distribution.
The velocity and acceleration distribution in blood in the target are
found solving the corresponding ﬂuid mechanical problem, thus
allowing for the prediction of the resulting trajectories of the
droplets accounting for gravity, air drag and droplet-droplet
aerodynamic interactions. The number of stains, the average stain
area, and the average impact angle on the cardstock target
predicted by the physical models of Refs. [41,42] were compared
with experimental data and revealed reasonably good agreement.
Also, the models were used to provide a further insight into the
phenomena of backward spattered blood by predicting the
locations of the stain area corresponding to a 50% cumulative
distribution and the geometric centroid of the spatter pattern. It
should be emphasized that the proposed empirical formulae of
Eqs. (7) and (8) have not been extensively tested against a variety of
gunshot spatter patterns. However, they have originated from the
experiments and predictions mentioned in this work which
provides an initial step on the path towards quantitative crime
scene reconstruction.
